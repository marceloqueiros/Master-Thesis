CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION   

  This document includes
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Forward-looking statements are based on management s beliefs and
assumptions. These forward-looking statements, which are intended to cover Duke
Energy and the applicable Duke Energy Registrants, are identified by terms and
phrases such as  anticipate,   believe,   intend,   estimate,   expect, 
 continue,   should,   could,   may,   plan,   project,   predict,   will, 
 potential,   forecast,   target,   guidance,   outlook,  and similar
expressions. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to be materially different from the results predicted.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
indicated in any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to:   

              State, federal and
foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives, including costs of compliance
with existing and future environmental requirements or climate change, as well
as rulings that affect cost and investment recovery or have an impact on rate
structures or market prices;   

              The ability to recover
eligible costs, including those associated with future significant weather
events, and earn an adequate return on investment through the regulatory
process;  

              The costs of decommissioning
Crystal River Nuclear Station   Unit 3 (Crystal River Unit 3) could prove to be
more extensive than are currently identified and all costs may not be fully
recoverable through the regulatory process;  

              The risk that the
credit ratings of the company or its subsidiaries may be different from what
the companies expect;  

              Costs and effects of
legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims;   

              Industrial, commercial
and residential growth or decline in service territories or customer bases
resulting from customer usage patterns, including energy efficiency efforts and
use of alternative energy sources, including self-generation and distributed
generation technologies;   

              Additional competition
in electric markets and continued industry consolidation;   

              Political and
regulatory uncertainty in other countries in which Duke Energy conducts
business;   

              The influence of
weather and other natural phenomena on operations, including the economic,
operational and other effects of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts and
tornadoes;   

              The ability to
successfully operate electric generating facilities and deliver electricity to
customers;  

              The impact on
facilities and business from a terrorist attack, cyber security threats, data
security breaches, and other catastrophic events;   

              The inherent risks
associated with the operation and potential construction of nuclear facilities,
including environmental, health, safety, regulatory and financial risks;   

              The timing and extent
of changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange
rates and the ability to recover such costs through the regulatory process,

The number of
residential, general service and industrial customers within the Regulated
Utilities service territory is expected to increase over time. However, growth
in the near-term is being hampered by the current economic conditions. Average
usage per residential customer is      

9       

PART I  

expected to remain
flat for the foreseeable future. While total industrial sales increased in 2013
when compared to 2012, the growth rate was modest when compared to historical
periods.   

   Seasonality
and the Impact of Weather   

  Regulated Utilities 
costs and revenues are influenced by seasonal patterns. Peak sales of
electricity occur during the summer and winter months, resulting in higher
revenue and cash flows in these periods. By contrast, lower sales of
electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant
maintenance. Peak gas sales occur during the winter months. Residential and
general service customers are most impacted by weather. Estimated weather
impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather
conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of
actual historical weather conditions.  

  The estimated impact
of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature
variances from a normal condition and customers  historic usage levels and
patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not and
cannot consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather
conditions such as humidity and relative temperature changes. The precision of
this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to
shorter term periods.  

  Degree-day data are
used to estimate energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures
based on each day s average temperature. Heating-degree days measure the
variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls
below a base temperature. Cooling-degree days measure the variation in weather
based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base
temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as
one heating-degree day and each degree of temperature above the base
temperature counts as one cooling-degree day.  

   Competition   

    Retail    

  Regulated Utilities  businesses operate as
the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the
exception of Ohio, which has a competitive electricity supply market. Regulated
Utilities
owns and
operates all of the facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distribute
electricity. Services are priced by state commission approved rates designed to
include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on
invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and
reliable electricity at fair prices. Competition in the regulated electric
distribution business is primarily from on-site generation of industrial
customers and distributed generation, such as rooftop solar, at residential, general
service and/or industrial customer sites.  

  Regulated Utilities is not aware of any
proposed legislation in any jurisdiction that would give its retail customers
the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or
deregulate the electric industry.   

  Although there is no
pending legislation at this time, if the retail jurisdictions served by Regulated
Utilities
become
subject to deregulation, the recovery of stranded costs could become a
significant consideration. Stranded costs primarily include the generation
assets of Regulated Utilities whose
value in a competitive marketplace may be less than their current book value,
as well as above-market purchased power commitments from qualified facilities
(QFs). QFs
are typically small power production facilities that generate power within a
utility company s service territory for which the utility companies are legally
obligated to purchase the energy at an avoided cost rate. Thus far, all states
that have passed restructuring legislation have provided for the opportunity to
recover a substantial portion of stranded costs.   

  Regulated Utilities  largest stranded cost
exposure is primarily related to Duke Energy Florida s purchased power
commitments with QFs, under which it has future minimum expected capacity
payments through 2025 of $3.5 billion. Duke Energy Florida was obligated to
enter into these contracts under provisions of the Public Utilities Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978. Duke Energy Florida continues to seek ways to address the
impact of escalating payments under these contracts. However, the FPSC allows full
recovery of the retail portion of the cost of power purchased from QFs. See
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and
Contingencies  for additional information related these purchased power
commitments.  

  In Ohio, Regulated
Utilities conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply. The cost of
energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers.
Regulated Utilities earns retail margin in Ohio on the transmission and
distribution of electricity only and not on the cost of the underlying energy.   

    Wholesale    

  Regulated Utilities competes with other
utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales, sales to municipalities
and cooperatives, and wholesale transactions. The principal factors in
competing for these sales are price, availability of capacity and power, and
reliability of service. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions
and fuel costs.  

  Increased competition
in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission
access could affect Regulated Utilities  load forecasts, plans for power supply and
wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be
impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to
the wholesale market and the ability of Regulated Utilities to attract new
customers and to retain existing customers.  

   Energy
Capacity and Resources    

  Regulated Utilities owns approximately
50,000 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity. For additional information on Regulated
Utilities 
generation
facilities, see Item 2,  Properties.   

  Energy and capacity
are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the
open market. Factors that could cause Regulated Utilities to purchase power for
its customers include generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions,
generation reliability, growth, and price. Regulated Utilities has interconnections
and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency
assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy, and reliability of power
supply.

PART I  

Regulated
Utilities 
generation
portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating
characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest
possible cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers. All options,
including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are
continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the
lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements.  

    Recently
Completed Generation Projects    

  Regulated Utilities
completed its generation fleet modernization program in 2013. The additional
capacity from this program has allowed Regulated Utilities to retire or plan to
retire older, less efficient capacity. The following table summarizes the
generation projects constructed and placed in service during the past three
years.

  The Subsidiary
Registrants periodically file Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) with state
regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over
a long term (15-20 years) and options being considered to meet those needs. The
IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants in 2013 and 2012 included planning
assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities
earlier than their current estimated useful lives. These facilities do not have
the requisite emission control equipment, primarily to meet U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that are not yet effective. These
facilities total approximately 2,447 MW at five sites. Duke Energy continues to
evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities
earlier than the current estimated useful lives, and plans to seek regulatory
recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any assets are
retired. For additional information related to potential plant retirements see
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters.   

   Sources
of Electricity   

  Regulated Utilities relies principally on
coal, natural gas and nuclear fuel for its generation of electricity. The
following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years
ended December 31, 2013.   

Coal    

  Regulated Utilities
meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and
short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased
under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and
at the surface. Regulated Utilities uses spot-market purchases to meet coal
requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term
contracts, which have various price adjustment provisions and market
re-openers, range from 2014 to 2016 for Duke Energy Carolinas, 2014 to 2018 for
Duke Energy Progress, 2014 to 2016 for Duke Energy Florida, and 2014 to 2025
for Duke Energy Indiana. Regulated Utilities expects to renew these contracts
or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts
expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. Coal
purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in Central
Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for
Florida is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia and the Illinois
Basin. Coal purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and
Illinois. Regulated Utilities has an adequate supply of coal under contract to
fuel its projected 2014 operations and a significant portion of supply to fuel
its projected 2015 operations. Coal inventory levels have begun to normalize
during the past year as weather patterns have trended closer to historical
averages, combined with improving economic indicators and higher natural gas
prices, which are resulting in higher coal-fired generation. Significantly
colder than normal temperatures in December 2013 and January 2014 continued the
trend of higher natural gas prices and increased coal-fired generation.  

11       

PART I  

The
current average sulfur content of coal purchased by Regulated Utilities is between
1.5 percent and 2 percent for Duke Energy Carolinas, between 1.5 percent and 2
percent for Duke Energy Progress, between 1 percent and 2.5 percent for Duke
Energy Florida, and between 2 percent and 3 percent for Duke Energy Indiana. Regulated
Utilities  environmental controls, in combination with the use of sulfur
dioxide (SO 2 ) emission allowances, enable Regulated Utilities to
satisfy current SO 2  emission limitations for its existing
facilities.  

    Nuclear    

  The industrial
processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining
and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, and services to
convert, enrich, and fabricate fuel assemblies.   

  Regulated Utilities has
contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors.
Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily
met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The
contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. Regulated
Utilities staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts
covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near-term and decreasing
portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements
not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be
fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the technical complexities of
changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, Regulated Utilities generally
sources these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis
using multi-year contracts.   

  Regulated Utilities has
entered into fuel contracts that cover 100 percent of its uranium concentrates,
conversion services, and enrichment services requirements through at least 2014
and cover fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least
2018. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, Regulated
Utilities believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire, or enter
into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel
materials and services.   

    Oil
and Gas    

  Oil and natural gas
supply for Regulated Utilities  generation fleet is purchased under term and
spot contracts from various suppliers. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy
Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana use derivative
instruments to limit a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for
natural gas. Regulated Utilities has dual-fuel generating facilities that can
operate with both fuel oil and natural gas. The cost of Regulated Utilities  oil and
natural gas is either at a fixed price or determined by market prices as
reported in certain industry publications. Regulated Utilities believes it has
access to an adequate supply of oil and gas for the reasonably foreseeable
future. Regulated Utilities  natural gas transportation for its gas generation
is purchased under term firm transportation contracts with interstate and
intrastate pipelines. Regulated Utilities may also purchase additional
shorter-term transportation for its load requirements during peak periods. The
Regulated Utilities natural gas plants are served by several supply zones and
multiple pipelines.  

    Purchased
Power    

  Regulated Utilities purchased
approximately 11.7 million megawatt-hours (MWh), 19.8 million MWh and 19.0
million MWh of its system energy requirements during 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively,
under purchase obligations and leases and had 3,800 and 4,500 MW of firm
purchased capacity under contract during 2013 and 2012, respectively. These
amounts include MWh for Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida for all
periods presented. These agreements include approximately 398 MW of firm
capacity under contract by Duke Energy Florida with certain QFs. Regulated
Utilities may need to acquire additional purchased power capacity in the future
to accommodate a portion of its system load needs. Regulated Utilities believes
that it can obtain adequate purchased power to meet these needs. However,
during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power
may be significantly affected.  

    Gas
for Retail Distribution    

  Regulated Utilities is
responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to retail
customers in its Ohio and Kentucky service territories. Regulated Utilities  natural
gas procurement strategy is to buy firm natural gas supplies and firm
interstate pipeline transportation capacity during the winter season and during
the non-heating season through a combination of firm supply and transportation
capacity along with spot supply and interruptible transportation capacity. This
strategy allows Regulated Utilities to assure reliable natural gas supply for
its non-curtailable customers during peak winter conditions and provides Regulated
Utilities the flexibility to reduce its contract commitments if firm customers
choose alternate gas. In 2013, firm supply purchase commitment agreements
provided approximately 100 percent of the natural gas supply.  

   Inventory   

  Generation of
electricity is capital intensive. Regulated Utilities must maintain an adequate
stock of fuel and materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous
operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December
31, 2013, the inventory balance for Regulated Utilities was $3,043 million. See
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies,  for additional information.   

   Dan River Ash Basin
Release   

  On February 2, 2014, a
break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas 
retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash
into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the
stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy
Carolinas estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24 million to 27 million
gallons of basin water were released into the river.  

  Duke
Energy cannot reasonably estimate the cost associated with remediation of this
release at this time. Other costs related to the Dan River release and other
ash basins, including   regulatory directives, natural
resources damages, future lawsuits, future claims, long-term environmental
impact costs, long-term operational changes, and costs associated with new laws
and regulations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.  

12       

PART I  

Nuclear Matters   

  Regulated Utilities owns,
wholly or partially, 12 nuclear reactors located at seven stations. Nuclear
insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property, decontamination and
premature decommissioning coverage; and replacement power expense coverage. Joint
owners reimburse Regulated Utilities for certain expenses associated with
nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson
Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting
from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability,
which currently is $13.6 billion. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies   Nuclear Insurance,  for more
information.  

  Regulated Utilities has
a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and
decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, FPSC and PSCSC
require Regulated Utilities to update their cost estimates for decommissioning
their nuclear plants every five years.  

  The following table
summarizes the fair value of nuclear decommissioning trust fund (NDTF) balances
and cost study results for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, and
Duke Energy Florida.  

The NCUC, FPSC and
PSCSC have allowed Regulated Utilities  to recover estimated decommissioning
costs through retail rates over the expected remaining service periods of their
nuclear stations. Regulated Utilities believes the decommissioning costs being
recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balance and
expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future
decommissioning. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Asset
Retirement Obligations,  for more information.  

  The Nuclear Waste
Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) (NWPA) provides the framework for development
by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities
for high-level radioactive waste materials. The NWPA promotes increased usage
of interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at existing nuclear plants. Regulated
Utilities will continue to maximize the use of spent fuel storage capability
within its own facilities for as long as feasible.   

  Under
federal law, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for the
selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Delays have occurred in the
DOE s proposed permanent repository to be located at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  

  Until
the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke
Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to safely manage their
spent nuclear fuel. With certain modifications and additional approvals by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), including the expansion of on-site dry
cask storage facilities, spent nuclear fuel storage facilities will be
sufficient to provide storage space for spent fuel through the expiration of
the operating licenses, including any license renewals, for all sites except
Shearon Harris Nuclear Station (Harris) and Crystal River Unit 3. Under current
regulatory guidelines, Harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel
pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. Crystal River
Unit 3 was retired in 2013, with plans to place the facility in SAFSTOR
(extended storage) prior to final decommissioning. An on-site dry cask storage
facility will be installed to accommodate storage of all spent nuclear fuel
until the DOE accepts the spent nuclear fuel.  

  The nuclear power
industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term
availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive
waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for
modifications and new plant construction, the technological and financial
aspects of decommissioning plants at the end of their licensed lives, and
requirements relating to nuclear insurance. Nuclear units are periodically
removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages,
repairs, uprates and certain other modifications.  

  Regulated
Utilities is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design,
construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. The following
table includes the current expiration of nuclear operating licenses.  

13       

PART I  

The
NRC issues orders with regard to security at nuclear plants in response to new
or emerging threats. The most recent orders include additional restrictions on
nuclear plant access, increased security measures at nuclear facilities and
closer coordination with intelligence, military, law enforcement and emergency
response functions at the federal, state and local levels. As the NRC, other
governmental entities and the industry continue to consider security issues, it
is possible that more extensive security plans could be required.  

   Regulation

State

The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC,
PUCO, IURC and KPSC (collectively, the state utility commissions) approve rates
for retail electric and gas service within their respective states. The state
utility commissions, except for the PUCO, also have authority over the
construction and operation of Regulated Utilities  generating facilities. Certificates of Public
Convenience and Necessity  
(  CPCN)
issued by the state utility commissions, as applicable, authorize Regulated
Utilities to construct and operate its electric facilities, and to sell
electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant
state utility commission is required for Regulated Utilities to issue
securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a
level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of
providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested
capital, including equity.  

  Each of the state
utility commissions allows recovery of certain costs through various
cost-recovery clauses, to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic
hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are
prudent. The clauses are in addition to approved base rates.   

  Fuel, fuel-related
costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by Regulated
Utilities. Regulated Utilities uses coal, oil, hydroelectric, natural gas and
nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix
that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the
associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in
fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of Regulated
Utilities, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been
imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery
from ratepayers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of Regulated
Utilities.

Federal     

  The FERC approves Regulated
Utilities  cost-based rates for electric sales to certain wholesale customers,
as well as sales of transmission service. Regulations of FERC and the state
utility commissions govern access to regulated electric and gas customers and
other data by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and
nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of
nonregulated affiliates with Regulated Utilities.   

    Regional Transmission

INTERNATIONAL ENERGY   

  International Energy
principally operates and manages power generation facilities and engages in
sales and marketing of electric power, natural gas, and natural gas liquids
outside the U.S. Its activities principally target power generation in Latin
America. Additionally, International Energy owns a 25 percent interest in
National Methanol Company (NMC), a large regional producer of methanol and
methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) located in Saudi Arabia. International
Energy s ownership interest will decrease to 17.5 percent by the end of 2016. The
investment in NMC is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  

  International Energy s
customers include retail distributors, electric utilities, independent power
producers, marketers, and industrial and commercial companies. International
Energy s current strategy is focused on optimizing the value of its current
Latin American portfolio and expanding the portfolio through investment in
generation opportunities in Latin America.   

  For information on
International Energy s generation facilities, see Item 2,  Properties.    

   Competition
and Regulation    

  International Energy s
sales and marketing of electric power and natural gas competes directly with
other generators and marketers serving its market areas. Competitors are
country and region-specific but include government-owned electric generating
companies, local distribution companies with self-generation capability and
other privately owned electric generating and marketing companies. The
principal elements of competition are price and availability, terms of service,
flexibility and reliability of service.   

  A high percentage of
International Energy s portfolio consists of baseload hydroelectric generation
facilities, which compete with other forms of electric generation available to
International Energy s customers and end-users, including natural gas and fuel
oils. Economic activity, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations,
weather, additional generation capacities and other factors affect the supply
and demand for electricity in the regions served by International Energy.  

  International Energy s
operations are subject to both country-specific and international laws and
regulations. (See  Environmental Matters  in this section.)   

   COMMERCIAL POWER   

  Commercial Power owns,
operates and manages power plants and engages in the wholesale marketing and
procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances related to these
plants as well as other contractual positions. Commercial Power s generation operations
consist primarily of Duke Energy Ohio s coal-fired and gas-fired nonregulated
generation assets located in the Midwest region of the United States and wind
and solar generation located throughout the United States. The asset portfolio
has a diversified fuel mix with baseload and mid-merit coal-fired units as well
as combined cycle and peaking natural gas-fired units.   

  Generation from the
coal-fired and gas-fired assets is dispatched into the PJM wholesale market.
These assets earn energy and capacity revenue at market prices. Duke Energy
Ohio is a PJM Fixed Resource Requirement (FRR) entity through May 31, 2015. As
an FRR entity, Duke Energy Ohio is obligated to self-supply capacity for the
Duke Energy Ohio load zone. Commercial Power has economically hedged its
forecasted coal-fired generation and a significant portion of its forecasted
gas-fired generation for 2014. Commercial Power also has long-term economic
hedges in place for a portion of expected coal and gas generation through 2017
and 2018, respectively. Capacity revenues are 100 percent fixed in PJM through
May 2017.  

  Energy and renewable
energy credits generated by wind and solar projects are generally sold at
contractual prices. Contracts are executed with load serving entities, which,
in most instances, have obligations under state-mandated renewable energy
portfolio standards or similar state or local renewable energy goals. Most
contracts have a term which approximates the estimated useful life of the
underlying generation project. In addition, Commercial Power operates and
develops transmission projects.  

  For information on
Commercial Power s generation facilities, see Item 2,  Properties.   

15       

PART I  

Commercial
Power also has a retail sales subsidiary, Duke Energy Retail Sales, LLC (Duke
Energy Retail), which is certified by the PUCO as a Competitive Retail Electric
Supplier (CRES) provider in Ohio. Duke Energy Retail serves retail electric and
gas customers in Ohio with energy and other energy services at competitive
rates.  

   Capacity Rider Filing   

  On August 29, 2012,
Duke Energy Ohio applied to the PUCO for the establishment of a charge for
capacity provided pursuant to its obligations as an FRR entity. The charge,
which is consistent with Ohio s state compensation mechanism, is estimated to
be approximately $729 million, and reflects Duke Energy Ohio s embedded cost of
capacity. On February 13, 2013, the PUCO denied Duke Energy Ohio s request.  

   Midwest Generation
Exit   

  On February 17, 2014,
Duke Energy Ohio announced that it had initiated a process to exit its
nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing period of
several months and potential regulatory approvals, Duke Energy Ohio expects to
dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to mid-2015.
In the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio will reclassify approximately $3.5
billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to assets held for
sale and expects to record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1 billion
to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated sales proceeds less
cost to sell.  

   Other Matters   

  Commercial Power is
subject to regulation at the federal level, primarily from the FERC.
Regulations of the FERC govern access to regulated electric customer and other
data by nonregulated entities, services provided between regulated and nonregulated
energy affiliates, and Commercial Power s investments in transmission projects.
These regulations affect the activities of Commercial Power.  

  For more information
on rate matters, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Regulatory Matters   Rate Related Information.    

  Commercial Power is
subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental
agencies. (For a discussion of environmental regulation, see  Environmental
Matters  in this section.)   

  See  Other Issues 
section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change
legislation and other EPA regulations under development, and the potential
impacts such legislation could have on Duke Energy s operations.   

   Market
Environment and Competition   

  The market price of
commodities and services, along with the quality and reliability of services
provided, drive competition in the wholesale energy business. Commercial
Power s main competitors include other nonregulated generators and wholesale
power providers.   

   Sources
of Electricity   

  Commercial Power
relies on coal and natural gas for its generation of electric energy.   

    Coal    

  Commercial Power meets
its coal demand through a portfolio of purchase supply contracts and spot
agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under supply contracts with
mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. Commercial Power
uses spot-market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by supply
contracts. Expiration dates for its supply contracts, which have various price
adjustment provisions and market re-openers, range through 2018. Commercial
Power expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with
other suppliers for the quantities and quality of coal required as existing
contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets
change. The majority of Commercial Power s coal is sourced from mines in the
Northern Appalachian and Illinois basins. Commercial Power has an adequate
supply of coal to fuel its projected 2014 operations. The majority of
Commercial Power s coal-fired generation is equipped with environmental
controls. As a result, Commercial Power is able to satisfy the current emission
limitations for SO 2  for existing facilities.   

    Gas    

  Commercial Power is
responsible for the purchase of natural gas to its gas turbine generators. In
general Commercial Power hedges its natural gas requirements using physical and
financial contracts. Physical gas is purchased in the spot market and under long-term
contracts to meet generation needs.   

   OTHER   

  The remainder of Duke
Energy s operations is presented as Other. While it is not an operating segment,
Other primarily includes unallocated corporate interest expense, certain
unallocated corporate costs, Bison Insurance Company Limited (Bison), Duke
Energy s wholly owned, captive insurance subsidiary, contributions to the Duke
Energy Foundation, and other investments in businesses the Company is in
various stages of exiting or winding down. On December 31, 2013, Duke Energy
sold its interest in DukeNet Communications Holdings, LLC (DukeNet) to Time
Warner Cable, Inc. Following the repayment of existing DukeNet indebtedness at
closing, transaction expenses and other purchase price adjustments, Duke Energy
received cash proceeds of approximately $215 million.  

  Bison s principal
activities as a captive insurance entity include the indemnification of various
business risks and losses, such as property, business interruption, workers 
compensation and general liability of subsidiaries and affiliates of Duke
Energy.

  The following is a brief
description of the nature of operations of each of Duke Energy Ohio s
reportable business segments.  

   REGULATED
UTILITIES   

  Regulated Utilities transmits
and distributes electricity in Ohio. Regulated Utilities also generates,
transmits and distributes electricity in Kentucky. Regulated Utilities also
transports and sells natural gas in Ohio and Kentucky. Duke Energy Ohio applies
regulatory accounting to substantially all of the operations in its Regulated
Utilities operating segment.

Utilities service area covers 3,000 square miles and supplies electric service
to 830,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers and provides
regulated transmission and distribution services for natural gas to 500,000
customers. See Item 2,  Properties  for further discussion of Duke Energy
Ohio s Regulated Utilities generating facilities.   

   COMMERCIAL
POWER   

  Commercial Power owns,
operates and manages power plants and engages in the wholesale marketing and
procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances related to these
plants, as well as other contractual positions. Commercial Power s generation operations
consist primarily of coal-fired and gas-fired nonregulated generation assets
located in the Midwest region of the United States. The asset portfolio has a
diversified fuel mix with baseload and mid-merit coal-fired units as well as
combined cycle and peaking natural gas-fired units. Generation from the
coal-fired and gas-fired assets is dispatched into the PJM wholesale market.
These assets earn energy and capacity revenue at market prices. See Item 2,
 Properties , for further discussion of Duke Energy Ohio s Commercial Power
generating facilities.  

  On February 17, 2014,
Duke Energy Ohio announced that it had initiated a process to exit its
nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing period of
several months and potential regulatory approvals, Duke Energy Ohio expects to
dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to mid-2015.
In the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio will reclassify approximately $3.5
billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to assets held for
sale and expects to record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1 billion
to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated sales proceeds less
cost to sell.  

  Duke Energy Ohio is a
PJM FRR entity through May 31, 2015. As an FRR entity, Duke Energy Ohio is
required to self-supply capacity for the Duke Energy Ohio load zone.  

  See Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for further discussion
related to regulatory filings.   

  In 2013, 2012, and 2011
Duke Energy Ohio earned approximately 37 percent, 36 percent, and 24 percent,
respectively, of its consolidated operating revenues from PJM. These revenues
relate to the sale of capacity and electricity from all of Duke Energy Ohio s
nonregulated generation assets in 2013 and 2012 and its gas-fired nonregulated
generation assets in 2011.

PART I  

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS   

In addition to other
disclosures within this Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and
Analysis   Matters Impacting Future Results for each registrant in Item 7, and
other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors
should be considered in evaluating Duke Energy and its subsidiaries. Such
factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ
substantially from those currently expected or sought. Unless otherwise
indicated, risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated
with all of the Duke Energy Registrants. Risks identified at the Subsidiary
Registrant level are generally applicable to Duke Energy.   

   Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks   

   The
Duke Energy Registrants  regulated electric revenues, earnings and results are
dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation,
transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their
ability to recover costs.    

  The Duke Energy
Registrants  regulated utility businesses are regulated on a
cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory
commission rules and procedures of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,
Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. If the Duke Energy Registrants  regulated utility
earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility commissions,
retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the
commissions, which may decrease the Duke Energy Registrants  future earnings.
Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in
providing service on a timely basis, the Duke Energy Registrants  future
earnings could be negatively impacted.   

  If legislative and
regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the Duke Energy
Registrants  exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers were eroded,
their future earnings could be negatively impacted.   

   Deregulation
or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition
and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows and their utility
businesses.    

  Increased competition
resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have a
significant adverse impact on the Duke Energy Registrants  results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows. Retail competition and the
unbundling of regulated electric service could have a significant adverse
financial impact on the Duke Energy Registrants due to an impairment of assets,
a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of capital.
The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by
additional competitors into the electric markets. The Duke Energy Registrants
cannot predict if or when they will be subject to changes in legislation or
regulation, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.   

   The
Duke Energy Registrants  businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation
that will affect their operations and costs.    

  The Duke Energy
Registrants are subject to regulation by FERC, NRC, EPA and various other
federal agencies. Regulation affects almost every aspect of the Duke Energy
Registrants  businesses, including, among other things, their ability to: take
fundamental business management actions; determine the terms and rates of
transmission and distribution services; make acquisitions; issue equity or debt
securities; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates; and
pay dividends upstream to the Duke Energy Registrants. Changes to federal
regulations are continuous and ongoing. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot
predict the future course of regulatory changes or the ultimate effect those
changes will have on their businesses. However, changes in regulation can cause
delays in or affect business planning and transactions and can substantially
increase the Duke Energy Registrants  costs.  

   The
Dan River ash basin release could impact the financial condition of the Duke
Energy Registrants.   

  There is uncertainty
regarding the extent and timing of the costs and liabilities relating to the
Dan River ash basin release, including the amount and extent of any civil or
criminal penalties, and resulting litigation. These uncertainties are likely to
continue for an extended period and may cause costs to increase. Thus, the Dan
River ash basin release could have a material adverse impact on the Duke Energy
Registrants  financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Furthermore, releases of a similar nature at any of the Duke Energy Registrants 
other ash basins could also result in a material adverse impact to their
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  

   The
Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and
regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can increase the cost
of operations, and which may impact or limit business plans, or cause exposure
to environmental liabilities.    

  The Duke Energy
Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations
affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, including air
emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous
waste. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating,
and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the Duke Energy Registrants
to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits,
inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and
regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for
cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure to
comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines,
penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets. The steps the
Duke Energy Registrants could be required to take to ensure their facilities
are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the Duke
Energy Registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their
facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy Registrants to incur losses. Further,
the Duke Energy Registrants  regulatory rate structure and their contracts with
customers may not necessarily allow for the recovery of capital costs incurred
to comply with new environmental regulations. Also, the Duke Energy Registrants
may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required
environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development
projects. Delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals,
failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or
regulations to more stringent compliance levels could result in additional
costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being
prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. Although it is not expected
that the costs of complying with current environmental regulations will have a
material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants  financial position,
results of operations or cash flows due to regulatory cost recovery, no
assurance can be made that the costs of complying with environmental
regulations in the future will not have such an effect.   

  The EPA has proposed
new federal regulations governing the management of coal combustion
by-products, cooling water intake structures, wastewater and carbon dioxide (CO 2 )
emissions. These regulations, as well as new regulations or legislative actions
resulting from the Dan      

20       

PART I  

River ash basis release, may
require the Duke Energy Registrants to make additional capital expenditures and
increase operating and maintenance costs.   

   Duke
Energy s investments and projects located outside of the U.S. expose it to
risks related to the laws, taxes, economic and political conditions, and
policies of foreign governments. These risks may delay or reduce Duke Energy s
realization of value from its international projects.    

  Duke Energy currently
owns and may acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and
projects outside the U.S. The economic, regulatory, market and political
conditions in some of the countries where Duke Energy has interests may impact
its ability to obtain financing on suitable terms. Other risks relate to its
customers  ability to honor their obligations with respect to projects and
investments, delays in construction, limitations on its ability to enforce
legal rights, and interruption of business, as well as risks of war,
expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification
of existing contracts and changes in law, regulations, market rules or tax
policy.   

   Operational Risks   

   The
Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations may be negatively affected by
overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control.    

  Sustained downturns or
sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the Duke
Energy Registrants operate and negatively influence electricity operations.
Declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns in the
Duke Energy Registrants  regulated electric service territories will reduce
overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce
production and, therefore, consumption of electricity. Although the Duke Energy
Registrants  regulated electric business is subject to regulated allowable
rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel, under periodic
adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity sold as a result of
economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby
diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns
that negatively impact the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations and
cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the
carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair
values.   

  The Duke Energy
Registrants also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive
power markets on a contractual basis. With respect to such transactions, the
Duke Energy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital
investments through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are
likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices. These market
prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and
could reduce the Duke Energy Registrants  revenues and margins, thereby
diminishing results of operations.   

  Factors
that could impact sales volumes, generation of electricity and market prices at
which the Duke Energy Registrants are able to sell electricity are as follows:   

weather
conditions, including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower
energy usage for heating or cooling purposes, respectively, and periods of low
rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an economical
manner;  

supply
of and demand for energy commodities;   

transmission
or transportation constraints or inefficiencies that impact nonregulated energy
operations;   

availability
of competitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by some
customers over electricity produced from coal, nuclear or gas plants, and customer
usage of energy-efficient equipment that reduces energy demand;   

natural
gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices;   

ability
to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, such as coal, gas and uranium; and  

capacity
and transmission service into, or out of, the Duke Energy Registrants  markets.  

   Natural
disasters or operational accidents may adversely affect the Duke Energy
Registrants  operating results.    

  Natural
disasters (such as electromagnetic events or the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in
Japan) or other operational accidents within the industry (such as the San
Bruno, California natural gas transmission pipeline failure) could have direct
significant impacts on the Duke Energy Registrants as well as on key
contractors and suppliers. Such events could indirectly impact the Duke Energy
Registrants through changes to policies, laws and regulations whose compliance
costs have a significant impact on the Duke Energy Registrants  financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.  

   The
Duke Energy Registrants  financial position, results of operations and cash
flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the
number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers.   

  Growth in customer
accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for
electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery
facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of
factors outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants, such as mandated
energy-efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed
generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population
changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the
overall level of economic activity.   

  Certain regulatory and
legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or
incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally,
technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy
efficiency in end-use electric devices or other improvements in or applications
of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.   

  Advances in
distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells,
micro-turbines, wind turbines, and solar cells, may reduce the cost of
alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central
power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants.   

21       

PART I  

Some
or all of these factors, could result in a lack of growth or decline in
customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may cause the failure
of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from
significant capital investments and expenditures which could have a material
adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash
flows.  

  Furthermore, the Duke
Energy Registrants currently have energy-efficiency riders in place to recover
the cost of energy-efficiency programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,
Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in
conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation,
regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a
negative financial impact.  

   The
Duke Energy Registrants  operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and
quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions
and severe weather.   

  Electric power
generation is generally a seasonal business. In most parts of the U.S., and
other markets in which Duke Energy operates, demand for power peaks during the
warmer summer months, with market prices typically peaking at that time. In
other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. Further, extreme weather
conditions such as heat waves or winter storms could cause these seasonal
fluctuations to be more pronounced. As a result, in the future, the overall
operating results of the Duke Energy Registrants  businesses may fluctuate
substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period-to-period
comparison less relevant.   

  Sustained severe
drought conditions could impact generation by hydroelectric plants, as well as
fossil and nuclear plant operations, as these facilities use water for cooling
purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment.
Furthermore, destruction caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes,
tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, can result in lost
operating revenues due to outages; property damage, including downed
transmission and distribution lines; and additional and unexpected expenses to
mitigate storm damage. The cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully
recoverable through the regulatory process.  

   The
Duke Energy Registrants  sales may decrease if they are unable to gain
adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission assets.    

  The Duke Energy
Registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and
operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to
the wholesale market. FERC s power transmission regulations, as well as those
of Duke Energy s international markets, require wholesale electric transmission
services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. If
transmission is disrupted, or if transmission capacity is inadequate, the Duke
Energy Registrants  ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered.   

  The different regional
power markets have changing regulatory structures, which could affect growth
and performance in these regions. In addition, the ISOs who oversee the
transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past, and
may impose in the future, price limitations and other mechanisms to address
volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other
mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the Duke Energy Registrants 
wholesale power marketing business.   

   Fluctuations
in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the
Duke Energy Registrants  operations as well as their financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.   

  The Duke Energy
Registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of
natural gas, coal, fuel oil, nuclear fuel, electricity and other energy-related
commodities as a result of their ownership of energy-related assets. Fuel costs
are recovered primarily through cost-recovery clauses, subject to the approval
of state utility commissions.   

  Additionally, the Duke
Energy Registrants are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill
their obligations. Disruption
in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other
things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations,    force majeure   
events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers,
could limit the Duke Energy Registrants to operate their facilities. Should counterparties
fail to perform, the Duke Energy Registrants might be forced to replace the
underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses
in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties.  

  Certain of the Duke
Energy Registrants  hedge agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting
of, derivative collateral with counterparties, depending on the daily
derivative position. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return
of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral with counterparties
negatively impact liquidity. Downgrades in the Duke Energy Registrants  credit
ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements. The Duke
Energy Registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to
market price activity.  

   Potential
terrorist activities or military or other actions, including cyber attacks and
data security breaches, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants 
businesses.    

  The continued threat
of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the
U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial
market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, which may
have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot
predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and possible
reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could be
directed against companies operating in the U.S. or their international
affiliates. Information technology systems, infrastructure and generation
facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist
activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups. The potential for
terrorism has subjected the Duke Energy Registrants  operations to increased
risks and could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. In
particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may experience increased capital and
operating costs to implement increased security for their cyber systems and
plants, including nuclear power plants under the NRC s design basis threat
requirements. These increased costs could include additional physical plant
security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist
incident.   

  Information security
risks have generally increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation
of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyber
attacks and data security breaches. The utility industry requires the continued
operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network
infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid.
Additionally, connectivity to the Internet continues to increase through smart
grid and other initiatives. Because of the critical nature of the
infrastructure, increased connectivity to the Internet and technology systems 
inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts
of war or terrorism or other types of data security breaches, the Duke Energy
Registrants face a heightened risk of cyber attack. In the event of such an
attack, the Duke Energy Registrants could (i) have business operations
disrupted, property damaged, customer information stolen and other      

22       

PART I  

private information accessed (ii) experience substantial
loss of revenues, repair and restoration costs, implementation costs for
additional security measures to avert future cyber attacks and other financial
loss, and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational
damage.  

   Failure
to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably
impact the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations.    

  Certain events, such
as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs, or
unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and
increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base
and the lengthy time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including
costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety
costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees,
including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and
expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor
may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially
considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities.
If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an
appropriately qualified workforce, their financial position or results of
operations could be negatively affected.   

   Duke
Energy s investments and projects located outside of the U.S. expose it to
risks related to fluctuations in currency rates. These risks, and Duke Energy s
activities to mitigate such risks, may adversely affect its cash flows and
results of operations.    

  Duke Energy s
operations and investments outside the U.S. expose it to risks related to
fluctuations in currency rates. As each local currency s value changes relative
to the U.S. dollar, the value in U.S. dollars of Duke Energy s assets and
liabilities in such locality and the cash flows generated in such locality,
expressed in U.S. dollars, also change. Duke Energy s primary foreign currency
rate exposure is to the Brazilian Real.   

  Duke Energy
selectively mitigates some risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations
by, among other things, indexing contracts to the U.S. dollar and/or local
inflation rates, hedging through debt denominated or issued in the foreign
currency and hedging through foreign currency derivatives. These efforts,
however, may not be effective and, in some cases, may expose Duke Energy to
other risks that could negatively affect its cash flows and results of
operations.   

   The
costs of retiring Duke Energy Florida s Crystal River Unit 3 could prove to be
more extensive than is currently identified.    

  Exit costs to wind
down operations and ultimately to retire and decommission the plant could
exceed estimates and, if not recoverable through the regulatory process, could
adversely affect Duke Energy s, Progress Energy s and Duke Energy Florida s
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  

   Duke
Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s membership in an RTO presents risks
that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.    

  The price at which
Duke Energy Ohio can sell its generation capacity and energy is dependent on a
number of factors, which include the overall supply and demand of generation
and load, other state legislation or regulation, transmission congestion, and
its business rules. As a result, the prices in day ahead and real time energy
markets and RTO capacity markets are subject to price volatility.
Administrative costs imposed by RTOs, including the cost of administering
energy markets, are also subject to volatility. PJM conducts Reliability
Pricing Model (RPM) base residual auctions for capacity on an annual planning
year basis. The results of the PJM RPM base residual auction are impacted by
the supply and demand of generation and load and also may be impacted by
congestion and PJM rules relating to bidding for Demand Response and Energy
Efficiency resources. Auction prices could fluctuate substantially over
relatively short periods of time. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome
of future auctions, but if the auction prices are sustained at low levels, its
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely
impacted.   

  The rules governing
the various regional power markets may also change, which could affect Duke
Energy Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s costs and/or revenues. To the degree
Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana incur significant additional fees and
increased costs to participate in an RTO, their results of operations may be
impacted. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be allocated a portion
of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in RTO
transmission rate design. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be
required to expand their transmission system according to decisions made by an
RTO rather than their own internal planning process. While RTO transmission
rates were initially designed to be revenue neutral, various proposals and
proceedings currently taking place by the FERC may cause transmission rates to
change from time to time. In addition, RTOs has been developing rules
associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated
with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and
firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on Duke Energy Ohio
and Duke Energy Indiana.   

  As a members of an
RTO, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are subject to certain additional
risks, including those associated with the allocation among RTO members, of
losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the RTO markets
and those associated with complaint cases filed against an RTO that may seek
refunds of revenues previously earned by RTO members.   

   Nuclear Generation Risks   

   Duke
Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida may incur
substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of
nuclear generating facilities.    

  Ownership interest in
and operation of nuclear stations by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy
Progress and Duke Energy Florida subject them to various risks. These risks
include, among other things: the potential harmful effects on the environment
and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the
storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the
amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that
might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with
respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear
plants at the end of their licensed lives.   

  Ownership and
operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with licensing
and safety-related requirements imposed by the NRC. In the event of
non-compliance, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, and/or
shut down a unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the
situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the NRC,
which could be prompted by,      

23       

PART I  

among other things, events
within or outside of the control of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress
and Duke Energy Florida, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned
by a third party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures,
as well as assessments to cover third-party losses. In addition, if a serious
nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the results
of operations and financial condition of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy
Progress and Duke Energy Florida.   

   Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock
Risks   

   The Duke
Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term borrowings and longer-term
capital markets to finance their capital requirements and support their
liquidity needs. Access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number
of conditions, many of which are beyond the Duke Energy Registrants  control.    

  The Duke Energy
Registrants  businesses are financed to a large degree through debt. The
maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does
not correlate to cash flows from their assets. Accordingly, as a source of
liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations
and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with
disparate maturities, the Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term
money markets as well as longer-term capital markets. The Subsidiary
Registrants also rely on access to short-term intercompany borrowings. If the Duke
Energy Registrants are not able to access capital at competitive rates or at
all, the ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy and
business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access
capital may limit the Duke Energy Registrants  ability to pursue improvements
or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on for future growth.   

  Market disruptions may
increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or
more financial markets. Such disruptions could include: economic downturns, the
bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company, capital market conditions generally,
market prices for electricity and gas, terrorist attacks or threatened attacks
on their facilities or unrelated energy companies, or the overall health of the
energy industry. The availability of credit under Duke Energy s revolving
credit facilities depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments
under such facilities to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise.
Systematic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a
bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement.   

  Duke Energy maintains a
revolving credit facility to provide back-up for its commercial paper program
and letters of credit to support variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may
be put to the Duke Energy Registrant issuer at the option of the holder. The
facility includes borrowing sublimits for the Duke Energy Registrants, each of
whom is a party to the credit facility, and financial covenants that limit the
amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for
the specific entity. Failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity
could preclude Duke Energy from issuing commercial paper or the Duke Energy
Registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the revolving
credit facility.   

   The
Duke Energy Registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no
assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings. If the Duke
Energy Registrants are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, they
would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of
letters of credit or cash, which may materially adversely affect their
liquidity.    

  Each of the Duke
Energy Registrants  senior long-term debt issuances is currently rated
investment grade by various rating agencies. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot
ensure their senior long-term debt will be rated investment grade in the
future.   

  If the rating agencies
were to rate the Duke Energy Registrants below investment grade, their
borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. In addition, their
potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further,
if the short-term debt rating were to fall, access to the commercial paper market
could be significantly limited. A reduction in liquidity and borrowing
availability could ultimately impact the ability to indefinitely reinvest the
earnings of Duke Energy s international operations, which could result in
significant income taxes that would have a material effect on its results of
operations.  

  A downgrade below
investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the
form of letters of credit or cash under various credit, commodity and capacity
agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative
agreements, which would require cash payments. All of these events would likely
reduce the Duke Energy Registrants  liquidity and profitability and could have
a material effect on their financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.   

   Non-compliance
with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the Duke Energy
Registrants  ability to execute future borrowings.   

  The Duke Energy
Registrants  debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other
covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods
could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.  

   Market
performance and other changes may decrease the value of the NDTF investments of
Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, which then
could require significant additional funding.   

  Ownership and
operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of
funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the
respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital markets affects
the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations.
Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have
significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these
trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield
uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a
number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of
the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for
decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress
and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF assets,
their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be
negatively affected.  

   Poor
investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other
factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy
Registrants  liquidity and results of operations.    

  The costs of providing
non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of
factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level
of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the
plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions
made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate
share of the      

24       

PART I  

cost and obligations related to these
plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to
increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors
impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its
plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the
Subsidiary Registrants  proportionate share of such cash funding obligations,
could have a material impact on the Duke Energy Registrants  financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

   Ash
Basin Litigation   

    North Carolina
Department of Environment and Natural Resources Enforcement Actions    

  In the first quarter
of 2013, environmental
organizations sent notices of intent to sue to Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke
Energy Progress related to alleged groundwater violations and Clean Water Act
violations from coal ash ponds at two of their coal-fired power plants in North
Carolina. The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources
(DENR) filed enforcement actions against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy
Progress alleging violations of water discharge permits and North Carolina
groundwater standards. The case against Duke Energy Carolinas was filed in
Mecklenburg County Superior Court. The case against Duke Energy Progress was
filed in Wake County Superior Court. On October 4, 2013, Duke Energy Carolinas,
Duke Energy Progress and DENR negotiated a proposed consent order. The consent
order assesses civil penalties (approximately $100,000 in the aggregate) and
imposes a compliance schedule requiring Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy
Progress to undertake monitoring and data collection activities toward making
appropriate corrective action to address any substantiated violations. On
February 10, 2014, DENR asked the court to postpone consideration of the
consent order while DENR reviews Duke Energy Carolinas  and Duke Energy
Progress s coal ash ponds in light of the release that occurred at Dan River on
February 2, 2014. On February 20, 2014, DENR informed the court it will make a
recommendation on the proposed consent order by March 21, 2014. See Note 5 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies  
Litigation   Duke Energy Carolinas  for additional information related to the
Dan River release.  

  On August 16, 2013,
the DENR filed an enforcement action against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke
Energy Progress related to their remaining plants in North Carolina, alleging
violations of the Clean Water Act and violations of the North Carolina
groundwater standards. The case against Duke Energy Carolinas was filed in
Mecklenburg County Superior Court. The case against Duke Energy Progress was
filed in Wake County Superior Court. Both of these cases have been assigned to
the judge handling the enforcement actions discussed above. Catawba Riverkeeper
Foundation, Inc. (Catawba Riverkeeper) moved to intervene in the Duke Energy
Carolinas case. Southern Environmental Law Center, on behalf of several
environmental groups, moved to intervene in the Duke Energy Progress case. On
November 17, 2013, the court granted, in part, Catawba Riverkeeper s and
Southern Environmental Law Center s motions to intervene, allowing them full
party status as to certain plants, but granting only permissive intervention
for the remaining plants.  

    Catawba Riverkeeper
Foundation, Inc. v. Duke Energy Carolinas    

  On June 11, 2013,
Catawba Riverkeeper filed a separate action in the United States Court for the
Western District of North Carolina. The lawsuit contends the state enforcement
action discussed above does not adequately address issues raised in its notice
of intent to sue. On August 1, 2013, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion to
dismiss this case in light of North Carolina s diligent prosecution in the
state enforcement actions. Catawba Riverkeeper filed objections to the
Magistrate s recommendation of dismissal on December 18, 2013.    

    Cape Fear River Watch,
Inc., Sierra Club, and Waterkeeper Alliance v. Duke Energy Progress    

  On September 12, 2013,
Cape Fear River Watch, Inc., Sierra Club, and Waterkeeper Alliance filed a
citizen suit in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina. The lawsuit alleges unpermitted discharges to surface water and groundwater
violations. Duke Energy Progress filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit on
November 5, 2013.  

  For additional
information, see Note     5
to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies.   

   Avian
Mortalities   

  On November 22, 2013, Duke
Energy entered into a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) related
to the incidental deaths of golden eagles and other migratory birds resulting
from turbine collisions at four wind farms in Wyoming.     Terms of the agreement include two misdemeanor violations of
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, payment of $1 million in fines and restitution,
five years  probation, and implementation of a migratory bird compliance plan.
The agreement includes a ten-year non-prosecution agreement for future   incidental deaths   at four facilities. Duke Energy undertakes adaptive management practices designed
to avoid and minimize additional avian impacts.  

Brazilian Transmission
Fee Assessments   

  On July 16, 2008, Duke
Energy International Geracao Paranapanema S.A. (DEIGP) filed a lawsuit in the
Brazilian federal court challenging transmission fee assessments imposed under
two new resolutions promulgated by the Brazilian electricity regulatory agency
(ANEEL) (collectively, the Resolutions). The Resolutions purport to impose
additional transmission fees on generation companies located in the State of
Sao Paulo for utilization of the electric transmission system. The fees were
retroactive to July 1, 2004 and effective through June 30, 2009. The charges
were based upon a flat-fee that failed to take into account the locational
usage by each generator. DEIGP's additional assessment under these Resolutions
amounts to approximately $57 million inclusive of interest through December
2013. Pending resolution of this dispute on the merits, DEIGP deposited the
disputed portion of the assessment into a court-monitored escrow, and paid the
undisputed portion to the distribution companies. In a decision published on
October 2, 2013, the trial court affirmed an additional fine imposed by ANEEL
on April 1, 2009 for DEIGP s failure to pay the disputed portion of the
assessment. DEIGP appealed the trial court s ruling and deposited $10 million
into a court-monitored escrow.  

   Brazilian
Regulatory Citations   

  In
September 2007, the State Environmental Agency of Parana (IAP) assessed seven
fines against DEIGP, totaling $15 million for failure to comply with
reforestation measures allegedly required by state regulations in Brazil. On
January 14, 2010, DEIGP received a notice that one of the fines was
subsequently increased, on grounds that DEIGP is an alleged repeat offender;
however, in 2012 the decision to increase the amount of that fine was reversed.
DEIGP filed administrative appeals with respect to all the fines. Between 2009
and 2012, four of the fines, in      

30       

PART I  

the total amount of $9
million, were judged to be valid in the administrative courts. DEIGP challenged
those administrative rulings in the Brazilian state courts, by filing judicial
actions for annulment and also requested its payment obligations be enjoined
pending resolution on the merits. In one of the four cases, the court granted
DEIGP s request for injunction, and subsequently ruled on the merits in favor
of DEIGP. The plaintiff filed an appeal. In two of the four cases, the court
granted DEIGP s request for injunction, and a decision on the merit is pending.
In the fourth case, DEIGP s request for injunction was denied; however, DEIGP
was granted permission to deposit the total amount of the fine in the court
registry and to suspend entry of the debt in the state tax liability roster.   

  Additionally,
DEIGP was assessed three environmental fines by the Brazilian federal
environmental enforcement agency, Brazil Institute of Environment and Renewable
Natural Resources (IBAMA), totaling approximately $1 million for improper
maintenance of existing reforested areas. DEIGP believes that it has properly
maintained all reforested areas and has challenged these assessments.  

   Gibson Notice of
Violations   

  Pursuant to Notices of
Violation dated June 23, 2011 and July 16, 2013, the EPA has asserted that, on
several occasions between August 1, 2008 through March 31, 2013, Duke Energy
Indiana s Gibson steam station violated opacity limits contained in its Title V
permit. Duke Energy Indiana expects to enter into a settlement agreement with
the EPA in the first quarter of 2014, which would require payment of a civil
penalty of $199,000.

DUKE
ENERGY   

Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with
its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte,
North Carolina. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its wholly owned
subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida,
Duke Energy Ohio, and Duke Energy Indiana, as well as in Latin America.   

  When discussing Duke Energy s consolidated
financial information, it necessarily includes the results of the Subsidiary
Registrants, which, along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the
Duke Energy Registrants.   

  Management s Discussion and Analysis should
be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for
the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011.  

Executive
Overview   

Merger
with Progress Energy   

  On July 2, 2012, Duke Energy merged with
Progress Energy, with Duke Energy continuing as the surviving corporation, and
Progress Energy becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. Duke Energy
Progress and Duke Energy Florida, Progress Energy s regulated utility
subsidiaries, are now indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy. Duke
Energy s consolidated financial statements include Progress Energy, Duke Energy
Progress and Duke Energy Florida activity beginning July 2, 2012.  

  Immediately preceding the merger, Duke Energy
completed a one-for-three reverse stock split with respect to the issued and
outstanding shares of Duke Energy common stock. All share and per share amounts
presented herein reflect the impact of the one-for-three reverse stock split.  

  For additional information on the details of
this transaction including regulatory conditions and accounting implications,
see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Acquisitions and
Dispositions of Businesses and Sales of Other Assets.   

   2013
Financial Results    

  The following table summarizes adjusted earnings
and net income attributable to Duke Energy for the years ended December 31, 2013,
2012 and 2011.   

Adjusted earnings increased from 2012 to 2013
primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of Progress Energy results in
2013, the impact of the revised rates, net of higher depreciation and
amortization expense and lower allowance for funds used during construction
(AFUDC). Adjusted earnings increased from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to the
inclusion of Progress Energy s results beginning July 2012, and the impact of
the 2011 Duke Energy Carolina s rate cases.   

  See  Results of Operations  below for a detailed
discussion of the consolidated results of operations, as well as a detailed
discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy s reportable business
segments, as well as Other.   

   2013
Areas of Focus and Accomplishments    

  In 2013, Duke Energy was focused on
completing the fleet modernization program, achieving constructive outcomes in
its rate cases, resolving key issues   including the future Crystal River Unit
3 nuclear station, improving nuclear fleet performance, and realizing merger
integration plans.  

   Completing the Fleet Modernization Program   

35       

PART II  

During
2013, Duke Energy completed its $9 billion fleet modernization program. This
program added approximately 6,600 MWs of new combined-cycle natural gas and
state-of-the-art coal capacity in North Carolina, South Carolina and Indiana.
This new generation will replace up to 6,700 MW of older coal and oil plants,
already retired or scheduled for retirement by 2015.   The Edwardsport IGCC   and   Sutton combined-cycle
natural gas plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, were placed in commercial
service in June and November, respectively.  

  At Edwardsport, Duke Energy has been testing,
tuning and optimizing the unit.   All major technology systems have been
validated. Performance testing was delayed in January by extreme weather, which
also caused some equipment issues that are being resolved. The Edwardsport IGCC
project is expected to achieve its full operational capabilities later this
year and to be completed within the revised cost estimate of $3.5 billion  .   

   Achieving Constructive
Outcomes in Rate Cases   

  Duke Energy reached
constructive regulatory outcomes in all five of its general rate cases to
recover investments made to modernize its fleet. When fully implemented, the
base rate cases will add approximately $600 million in annualized revenues,
while keeping customers  retail priced below national averages.  

   Resolving Key Issues   

  Duke Energy also made
the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3, resolved insurance claims with its
insurance provider, Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), and obtained
approval from the FPSC of a comprehensive settlement.   This settlement
agreement addressed cost recovery of the nuclear unit, Crystal River 1 and 2
coal units, and the proposed Levy Nuclear Station (Levy). The settlement
agreement also provides for new generation in the latter half of this decade to
meet customer demand.   

   Improving Nuclear
Fleet Performance   

  In 2013, Duke Energy s nuclear fleet achieved
a capacity factor of 92.8 percent, the 15 th  consecutive year with a
capacity factor over 90 percent. Duke Energy has made targeted investments at
nuclear stations to bring the entire fleet to consistent level of excellent
performance. In particular, the Robinson Nuclear Station (Robinson) completed a
record continuous run of 531 days before beginning a scheduled refueling outage
in September. This complemented the record of continuous runs achieved at
Oconee Nuclear Station Units 2 and Unit 3.   

   Realizing Merger Integration Plans   

  Duke Energy expects to
exceed its original targets for fuel and joint-dispatch savings, which benefit
customers in the North Carolina and South Carolina. Through 2013, Duke Energy
has recorded approximately $190 million of cumulative fuel and joint-dispatch
savings since the merger closed. In addition, approximately 65 percent of the
total guaranteed savings of $687 million have been contractually locked-in or
generated.  

  Duke Energy is also
realizing cost synergies by eliminating duplicative functions and has exceed
the original target of five to seven percent in non-fuel operating and
maintenance savings. Duke Energy is on pace to deliver about nine percent, or
approximately $550 million, of non-fuel operating and maintenance expense in
2014.   

   2014
Objectives    

  Duke Energy is dedicated to the energy
experience that customers value and trust. Duke Energy strives for leadership
and excellence that benefit customers, shareholders and employees. Objectives
for 2014 are:  

Continue
to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-decile safety results,  

Develop
and engage employees,  

Deliver
new value by improving the customer experience and advancing more flexible
regulatory models,   

Establish
a rigorous process for managing business and financial performance to deliver
customer value at a competitive price,  

Successfully
complete 2014 integration milestones and continue innovative use of technology
to deliver value,  

Achieve
2014 financial goals,   including delivering adjusted diluted EPS guidance
range of $4.45 - $4.60,   and advance viable future growth opportunities for
regulated and nonregulated businesses  ,    and  

Serve
as a respected leading voice in helping to shape national and state energy
policies.  

  Due to the
forward-looking nature of the adjusted diluted EPS range, information to
reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measure is not available at this time, as Duke Energy is unable to
forecast all special items, the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the
Commercial Power segment, or any amounts that may be reported as discontinued operations
or extraordinary items for future periods.  

Results
of Operations   

In this section, Duke Energy provides
analysis and discussion of earnings and factors affecting earnings on both a
GAAP and non-GAAP basis.   

  Management evaluates
financial performance in part based on the non-GAAP financial measures,
adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS). These items
are measured as income from continuing operations after deducting income attributable
to noncontrolling interests, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of
special items and mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial
Power segment. Special items represent certain charges and credits, which
management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis, although it is
reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur. Mark-to-market
adjustments reflect the impact of derivative contracts, which are used in Duke
Energy s hedging of a portion of the economic value of its generation assets in
the Commercial Power segment. The mark-to-market impact of derivative contracts
is recognized in GAAP earnings immediately as such derivative contracts do not
qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory treatment. The economic value of
generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price
volatility of input and output commodities (e.g. coal, electricity, natural
gas). Economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and
output commodities related to generation assets. Operations of the generation
assets are accounted for under the accrual method. Management believes
excluding impacts of mark-to-market changes of the derivative contracts from
adjusted earnings until      

36       

PART II  

settlement better matches the
financial impacts of the derivative contract with the portion of economic value
of the underlying hedged asset. Management believes the presentation of
adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to
investors, as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of Duke
Energy s performance across periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial
measures for planning and forecasting and for reporting results to the Board of
Directors, employees, shareholders, analysts and investors concerning Duke
Energy s financial performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for
adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are Net Income Attributable to Duke
Energy Corporation and Diluted EPS attributable to Duke Energy Corporation
common shareholders, which include the dollar and per share impact of special
items, mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power
segment and discontinued operations.  

  Management evaluates segment performance
based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing
operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Segment income,
as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are
eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Management also uses adjusted
segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment
performance. Adjusted segment income is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it is
based upon segment income adjusted for special items and mark-to-market impacts
of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment. Management believes the presentation
of adjusted segment income provides useful information to investors, as it
provides them with an additional relevant comparison of a segment s performance
across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted segment
income is segment income, which represents segment income from continuing
operations, including any special items and mark-to-market impacts of economic
hedges in the Commercial Power segment.  

  See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements,  Business Segments,  for a discussion of Duke Energy s segment
structure.  

   Overview   

  The following table reconciles non-GAAP
measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  

The variance in adjusted
earnings for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily
due to:   

The
inclusion of Progress Energy results for the first six months of 2013;  

Increased
retail pricing and riders resulting primarily from the implementation of
revised rates in all jurisdictions; and  

37       

PART II  

Lower
operating and maintenance expense resulting primarily from the adoption of
nuclear outage cost levelization in the Carolinas, lower benefit costs and
merger synergies  .

Partially offsetting
these increases was:  

Higher
depreciation and amortization expense;  

Lower
AFUDC;   

Lower
nonregulated Midwest gas generation results; and   

Incremental
shares issued to complete the Progress Energy merger (impacts per diluted share
amounts only).   

  The
variance in adjusted earnings for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to
2011, was primarily due to:   

The
inclusion of Progress Energy results beginning in July 2012; and  

Increased
retail pricing and riders primarily resulting from the implementation of
revised rates in North Carolina and South Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas.   

  Partially offsetting
these increases was:  

Unfavorable
weather in 2012 compared to 2011;   

Higher
depreciation and amortization expense;  

Lower
nonregulated Midwest coal generation results; and   

Incremental
shares issued to complete the Progress Energy merger (impacts per diluted share
amounts only).   

   Segment
Results   

  The remaining
information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP
basis.  

   Regulated
Utilities    

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012

Regulated
Utilities  results were positively impacted by 2012 impairment and other charges
related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant, higher retail pricing and rate riders, the
inclusion of Progress Energy results for the first six months of 2013, a net
increase in wholesale power revenues, and higher weather normal sales volumes.
These impacts were partially offset by higher income tax expense, Crystal River
Unit 3      

38       

PART II  

charges, lower AFUDC equity and higher
depreciation and amortization expense. The following is a detailed discussion
of the variance drivers by line item.  

    Operating Revenues.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$4,339 million increase due to the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first
six months of 2013,   

A $434
million net increase in retail pricing primarily due to revised rates approved
in all jurisdictions;  

A
$76 million net increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily
due to additional volumes and charges for capacity for customers served under
long-term contracts; and   

A
$72 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers (net
of fuel revenue) reflecting increased demand.  

  Partially offset by:   

A
$132 million decrease in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven
primarily by (i) the impact of lower Florida residential fuel rates, including
amortization associated with the settlement agreement approved by the FPSC in
2012 (2012 Settlement), (ii) lower fuel rates for electric retail customers in
the Carolinas, Florida and Ohio, and (iii) lower revenues for purchased power, partially
offset by       (iv) increased demand from electric retail customers. Fuel
revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers.  

    Operating Expenses.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$3,393 million increase due to the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first
six months of 2013,   

A
$346 million increase in impairment and other charges in 2013 primarily related
to Crystal River Unit 3 and Levy. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information, and  

A
$102 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to
a decrease in the reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization
expense as allowed under the 2012 Settlement.   

  Partially offset by:   

A
$600 million decrease due to 2012 impairment and other charges related to the
Edwardsport IGCC plant. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Regulatory Matters,  for additional information, and  

A $120
million decrease in fuel expense (including purchased power and natural gas
purchases for resale) primarily related to (i) the application of the NEIL
settlement proceeds in Florida, including amortization associated with the 2012
Settlement; (ii) lower purchased power costs in (a) the Carolinas, primarily
due to additional generating capacity placed in service in late 2012 and market
conditions, (b) Ohio, primarily due to reduced sales volumes, and (c) Indiana, reflective
of market conditions; partially offset by (iii) higher volumes of natural gas
used in electric generation due primarily to additional generating capacity
placed in service; (iv) higher prices for natural gas and coal used in electric
generation; and (v) higher volumes of coal used in electric generation
primarily due to generation mix.   

    Other
Income and Expenses, net.     The decrease is primarily due to lower AFUDC
equity, resulting from major projects that were placed into service in late
2012 and the
implementation of new customer rates related to the IGCC rider, partially
offset by the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013.   

    Interest
Expense.     The
variance was primarily driven by     the inclusion of
Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013.   

    Income
Tax Expense.    
The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective
tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 37.8 percent and
35 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily
due to an increase in pretax income and a reduction in AFUDC equity.  

   Year
Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011    

  Regulated
Utilities  results were positively impacted by the inclusion of Progress Energy
results beginning in July 2012, higher net retail pricing and rate riders and
decreased operating and maintenance expenses. These impacts were partially
offset by additional charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant, unfavorable
weather, and increased depreciation and amortization.   

    Operating Revenues.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$4,918 million increase in operating revenues due to the inclusion of Progress
Energy beginning in July 2012;  

A
$352 million net increase in retail pricing and rate riders primarily due to
revised retail rates resulting from the 2011 North Carolina and South Carolina
rate cases implemented in the first quarter of 2012, and revenues recognized
for energy efficiency programs; and  

A
$293 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven
primarily by higher revenues in Ohio for purchases of power as a result of the
Ohio Electric Stabilization Plan (ESP), higher fuel rates for electric retail
customers in all jurisdictions, and higher revenues for purchases of power in
Indiana and the Carolinas, partially offset by decreased demand from electric
retail customers in 2012 mainly due to unfavorable weather conditions, and
lower demand and fuel rates in Ohio and Kentucky from natural gas retail
customers. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers.  

  Partially offset by:   

A
$155 million decrease in electric and gas sales (net of fuel) to retail
customers due to unfavorable weather conditions in 2012 compared to 2011. For
the Carolinas, weather statistics for cooling degree days in 2012 were less
favorable compared to 2011, while      

39       

PART II  

cooling degree days
in Ohio and Indiana were favorable in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.
For the Carolinas, Ohio and Indiana, weather statistics for heating degree days
in 2012 were unfavorable compared to 2011.  

    Operating Expenses.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$3,845 million increase in operating expenses due to the inclusion of Progress
Energy beginning in July 2012;  

A
$378 million increase due to additional charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC
plant that was under construction. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information;  

A
$277 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power and natural
gas purchases for resale) primarily related to higher purchases of power in
Ohio as a result of the new Ohio ESP, higher volumes of natural gas used in
electric generation, higher coal prices, higher purchased power costs in
Indiana and the Carolinas, partially offset by lower volume of coal used in
electric generation resulting from unfavorable weather conditions and lower
coal-fired generation due to low natural gas prices, lower prices for natural
gas used in electric generation, and lower gas volumes and prices to
full-service retail gas customers; and  

A
$105 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to
increases in depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and
amortization of regulatory assets.   

  Partially offset by:   

A $99
million decrease in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to the
establishment of regulatory assets in the first quarter of 2012, pursuant to
regulatory orders, for future recovery of certain employee severance costs
related to the 2010 voluntary severance plan and other costs, and lower storm
costs, partially offset by increased costs associated with the energy-efficiency
programs.   

    Other
Income and Expense, net.     The variance was driven primarily by the inclusion of
Progress Energy beginning in July 2012.          

    Interest
Expense.     The
variance was primarily driven by     the inclusion of
Progress Energy beginning in July 2012.   

    Income
Tax Expense.    
The variance is primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective
tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 35 percent and
36.3 percent, respectively.      

    Matters
Impacting Future Regulated Utilities Results    

  Appeals
of recently approved rate cases are pending at the North Carolina Supreme
Court. The North Carolina Attorney General (NCAG) and NC Waste Awareness and
Reduction Network (NC WARN) dispute the rate of return, capital structure and
other matters approved by the NCUC. The outcome of these appeals could have an
adverse impact to Regulated Utilities  financial position, results of
operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Regulatory Matters,  for additional information.  

  On
February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at the
retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash
into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the
stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the river. For
additional information related to the ash basin release, see  Other Issues   in
this section.  

   International
Energy    

Year
Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012   

  International Energy s results were
negatively impacted by an extended outage at NMC and unfavorable exchange rates
in Latin America, partially offset by the acquisition of Iberoamericana de
Energ a Ibener, S.A. (Ibener) in 2012 and higher average prices and lower
purchased power costs in Brazil. The following is a detailed discussion of the
variance drivers by line item.  

    Operating Revenues.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$67 million decrease in Brazil due to weakening of the Real to the U.S. dollar,  

A
$53 million decrease in Central America due to lower average prices and
volumes, and  

An
$18 million decrease in Argentina as a result of unfavorable exchange rates.  

40       

PART II  

Partially offset by:   

A
$67 million increase in Brazil due to higher average prices, net of lower
volumes, and  

A
$65 million increase in Chile as a result of asset acquisitions in 2012.  

    Operating Expenses.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$65 million decrease in Central America due to lower fuel costs, partially
offset by higher purchased power and coal consumption, and  

A
$20 million decrease in Brazil     due to weakening
of the Real to the U.S. dollar and lower purchased power partially offset by
higher variable costs.  

  Partially offset by:   

A
$36 million increase in Chile as a result of acquisitions in 2012.  

    Other
Income and Expenses, net.         The decrease was primarily driven by a net
currency remeasurement loss in Latin America due to strengthening of the
dollar, and lower equity earnings at NMC as a result of lower MTBE average
prices and lower volumes due to extended maintenance, partially offset by lower
butane costs.  

    Interest
Expense.     
   The
variance was primarily due to the Chile acquisitions in 2012, partially offset
by favorable exchange rates and lower inflation in Brazil.  

    Income
Tax Expense.    
The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective
tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 28.3 percent and
24.8 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily
due to a higher proportion of earnings in countries with higher tax rates.   

   Year
Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011    

  International Energy s
results were negatively impacted by unfavorable exchange rates in Brazil, a
2011 Peru arbitration award, and lower margins in Central America, partially
offset by higher average prices and volumes in Brazil and higher average prices
in Peru. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line
item.  

    Operating Revenues.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$53 million increase in Central America as a result of higher volumes due to a
full year of commercial operations of the Las Palmas II plant and favorable
hydrology,  

A
$24 million increase in Peru due to higher average prices, and  

A
$10 million increase in Argentina due to higher volumes as a result of
favorable hydrology, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates.  

    Operating Expenses.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$76 million increase in Central America due to higher fuel costs and
consumption as a result of increased dispatch.  

    Other
Income and Expense, net.     The variance was primarily driven by the absence of a
$20 million arbitration award in Peru.  

    Interest Expense.         The variance was
primarily due to lower capitalized interest in Central America and Brazil, as
well as higher inflation partially offset by favorable exchange rates in
Brazil.  

    Income Tax Expense.     The variance in tax
expense is primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rates
for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 24.8 percent and 28.9
percent, respectively.   

   Commercial
Power   

41       

PART II  

Year
Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012    

  Commercial Power s
results were negatively impacted by lower   PJM   capacity revenues and
lower income from the renewables portfolio and gas-fired generation assets.
These impacts are partially offset by higher income tax benefits and higher
income from the coal-fired generation assets. The following is a detailed
discussion of the variance drivers by line item.  

    Operating
Revenues.     
   The variance
was driven primarily by:   

A
$102 million increase in net mark-to-market revenues on non-qualifying power
and capacity hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market gains of $96 million
in 2013 compared to losses of $6 million in 2012;  

A
$68 million increase for the gas-fired generation assets driven primarily by higher
power prices, partially offset by decreased volumes; and  

A
$67 million increase due to higher volumes in the renewables portfolio.  

  Partially
offset by:   

An
$85 million decrease in PJM capacity revenues related to lower average cleared
capacity auction pricing; and    

An
$81 million decrease due primarily to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012.  

    Operating
Expenses.     
   The variance
was driven primarily by:   

A
$109 million increase in fuel expenses from the gas-fired generation assets
driven by higher average natural gas prices per million British Thermal Units
(MMBtu), partially offset by decreased natural gas volumes; and  

A
$96 million increase in net mark-to-market fuel expenses on non-qualifying fuel
hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market losses of $99 million in 2013
compared to losses of $3 million in 2012.  

    (Losses) Gains on
Sales of Other Assets and Other, net.     The variance is attributable to a loss
recognized on the sale of certain renewable development projects in 2013 and a
gain on the 2012 contribution of certain renewable assets to a joint venture.  

    Other Income and Expense,
net.     
   The variance
is primarily due to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012, lower interest
income and lower equity earnings from the renewables portfolio.  

    Income Tax Benefit.     The variance was
primarily due to a decrease in both pretax income and manufacturing deductions
combined with higher production tax credits in 2013. The effective tax rates
for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 97.2 percent and (9.5)
percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the period was
primarily due to a pretax loss in 2013 compared to pretax income in 2012.   

   Year
Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011    

  Commercial Power s
results were negatively impacted by the net impact of the expiration of the
2009-2011 ESP and the impact of competitive market dispatch for the coal-fired
assets, lower Duke Energy Retail earnings, and lower PJM capacity revenues.
These impacts were partially offset by lower operating expenses, lower
impairment charges, and increased margins from the gas-fired generation assets.
The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.  

    Operating
Revenues.     
   The
variance was driven primarily by:   

A
$285 million decrease for the coal-fired generation assets driven primarily by
the expiration of the 2009-2011 ESP, net of stability charge revenues under the
2012-2014 ESP, partially offset by participating in the   PJM  
wholesale energy market in 2012;  

A
$116 million decrease for Duke Energy Retail resulting from lower volumes and
unfavorable pricing;  

A
$39 million decrease for the gas-fired generation assets driven primarily by
lower power prices, partially offset by increased volumes;  

A
$27 million decrease due primarily to the termination of certain non-core operations
at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and a reduction of coal sales volumes
as a result of lower natural gas prices;  

An
$18 million decrease in PJM capacity revenues related to lower average cleared
capacity auction pricing in 2012 compared to 2011 for the gas-fired generation
assets, net of an increase associated with the move of the coal-fired
generation assets from Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) to
PJM in 2012; and  

An
$8 million decrease in net mark-to-market revenues on non-qualifying power and
capacity hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market losses of $6 million in
2012 compared to gains of $2 million in 2011.  

  Partially
offset by:   

A
$64 million increase from participation in competitive retail load auctions;
and  

A
$17 million increase from higher production in the renewables portfolio.  

42       

PART II  

Operating Expenses.         The variance was
driven primarily by:   

A
$140 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses resulting primarily
from the prior year recognition of MISO exit fees; lower transmission costs,
prior year station outages, and 2011 regulatory asset amortization expenses;  

An
$88 million decrease primarily from the 2011 impairment of excess emission
allowances as a result of the EPA s issuance of the Cross-State Air Pollution
Rule (CSAPR);  

An
$85 million decrease in fuel expenses from the gas-fired generation assets
driven by lower natural gas costs, partially offset by increased volumes;  

A
$19 million decrease in fuel used due primarily to the termination of certain non-core
operations at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and from lower natural gas
prices;  

A
$15 million decrease due to the receipt of funds in 2012 related to a
previously written-off receivable associated with the Lehman Brothers
bankruptcy;  

A
$15 million decrease in purchased power to serve Duke Energy Retail customers;
and  

A
$13 million decrease in fuel used for the coal-fired generation assets driven
primarily by lower generation volumes.  

  Partially
offset by:  

A
$54 million increase in purchased power to serve competitive retail load
auctions.  

    Other Income and
Expense, net.     
   The
variance is primarily due to the sale of certain Duke Energy Generation
Services, Inc. (DEGS) operations and higher equity earnings from the renewables
portfolio.  

    Interest Expense.         The variance is
primarily due to higher capitalized interest on wind construction projects.  

    Income Tax Benefit.     The variance in tax
benefit is primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rates
for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were (9.5) percent and (1.4)
percent, respectively.   

    Matters
Impacting Future Commercial Power Results     

  On
February 17, 2014, Commercial Power announced that it had initiated a process
to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing
period of several months and potential regulatory approvals, Commercial Power
expects to dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to
mid-2015. In the first quarter of 2014, Commercial Power will reclassify
approximately $3.5 billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to
assets held for sale and expects to record an estimated pretax  impairment
charge of $1 billion to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated
sales proceeds less cost to sell.  

  In
2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision holding that Commercial
Power is responsible for certain MVP costs, a type of Transmission Expansion
Planning (MTEP) cost, approved by MISO prior to the date of Commercial Power s
withdrawal. The initial decision will be reviewed by FERC. If FERC upholds the
initial decision, Commercial Power intends to file an appeal in federal court.
If Commercial Power ultimately is found to be responsible for these costs, a
portion of these costs may not be eligible for recovery, resulting in an
adverse impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for
additional information.  

  Changes
or variability in assumptions used in calculating fair value of the renewables
reporting unit for goodwill testing purposes including but not limited to,
legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term growth rates
and discount rates, could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the
renewables reporting unit. In the event of a significant decline in the
estimated fair value of the renewables reporting unit, goodwill and other asset
impairment charges could be recorded. The carrying value of goodwill and
intangible assets associated with proposed renewable projects within Commercial
Power s renewables reporting unit was approximately $84 million at December 31,
2013. In
addition, management periodically reviews individual projects within Commercial
Power s renewables portfolio to evaluate ongoing alignment with the strategic
direction of the business. A determination that a project is no longer consistent
with the business strategy and a decision to divest of a project or projects
could result in an impairment charge.  

   Other    

43       

PART II  

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012    

  Other s
results were positively impacted by lower charges related to the Progress Energy merger,
the sale of DukeNet, and increased current year activity from mitigation sales
related to the Progress Energy merger. These impacts were partially offset by
increased interest expense, lower income tax benefit and the Crescent Resources
LLC (Crescent) litigation reserve in 2013. The following is a detailed discussion
of the variance drivers by line item.   

    Operating Revenues.         The variance was
driven primarily by increased activity from mitigation sales related to the
Progress Energy merger and higher premiums earned at Bison as a result of the
addition of Progress Energy.   

    Operating Expenses.         The variance was
driven primarily by lower charges related to the Progress Energy merger, and
prior year donations, partially offset by the Crescent litigation reserve in
2013 and unfavorable loss experience at Bison as a result of the addition of
Progress Energy.  

    Other Income and
Expense     ,
net.   
The variance was driven primarily by a gain on the sale of Duke Energy s 50
percent ownership in DukeNet in 2013.  

    Interest Expense.     The variance was due
primarily to the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013
and additional debt issuances.  

    Income Tax Benefit.     The variance was
primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss. The effective tax rates for the
years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 55.1 percent and 41.1 percent, respectively.  

   Year
Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011    

  Other s results were
negatively impacted by charges
related to the Progress Energy merger and higher interest expense. These
negative impacts were partially offset by higher income tax benefit due to
increased net expense and higher returns on investments that support benefit
obligations. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by
line item.  

    Operating Revenues.         The variance was
driven primarily by higher premiums earned at Bison as a result of the addition
of Progress Energy and mark-to-market activity at Duke Energy Trading and
Marketing, LLC (DETM).  

    Operating Expenses.         The variance was
driven primarily by charges related to the Progress Energy merger and higher
current year donations. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower
JV costs related to DETM.  

    Other Income and
Expense     ,
net.   
The variance was driven primarily by current year impairments and prior year
gains on sales of investments, higher interest income recorded in 2011
following the resolution of certain income tax matters related to prior years
and reversal of reserves related to certain guarantees Duke Energy had issued
on behalf of Crescent in 2011. These negative impacts were partially offset by
higher returns on investments that support benefit obligations.  

    Interest Expense.     The variance was due
primarily to higher debt balances as a result of debt issuances and the
inclusion of Progress Energy interest expense beginning in July 2012.  

    Income Tax Benefit.     The variance is
primarily due to an increase in pretax loss. The effective tax rates for the
years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 41.1 percent and 56.0 percent, respectively.  

    Matters
Impacting Future Other Results     

  Duke
Energy previously held an effective 50 percent interest in Crescent. Crescent
was a real estate joint venture formed by Duke Energy in 2006 that filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2009. On June 9, 2010, Crescent
restructured and emerged from bankruptcy and Duke Energy forfeited its entire
50 percent ownership interest to Crescent debt holders. This forfeiture caused
Duke Energy to recognize a loss, for tax purposes, on its interest in the
second quarter of 2010. Although Crescent has reorganized and emerged from
bankruptcy with creditors owning all Crescent interest, there remains
uncertainty as to the tax treatment associated with the restructuring. Based on
this uncertainty, it is possible that Duke Energy could incur a future tax
liability related to the tax losses associated with its partnership interest in
Crescent and the resolution of issues associated with Crescent s emergence from
bankruptcy.

Basis of Presentation   

The results of
operations and variance discussion for Duke Energy Carolinas is presented in a
reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of
Form 10-K.  

Results of Operations   

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to
2012    

    Operating Revenues.     The variance was
primarily due to:   

A
$104 million increase in fuel revenues driven primarily by higher natural gas
prices and increased sales volumes. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and
wholesale customers;   

A
$98 million increase in retail rates in North Carolina and South Carolina;  

A
$44 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers
primarily due to higher demand; and  

A
$32 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily due
to a new customer in 2013, increased capacity charges, and additional volumes
for customers served under long-term contracts.  

    Operating Expenses.     The variance was
primarily due to   :     

A
$111 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to
lower costs associated with the Progress Energy merger, decreased corporate
costs, lower outage and non-outage costs at generation plants and the
levelization of nuclear outage costs, partially offset by the establishment of
regulatory assets in the first quarter of 2012, pursuant to regulatory orders
for future recovery of certain employee severance costs related to the 2010
voluntary severance plan and other costs; and    

A
$31 million decrease in impairment charges related to the merger with Progress
Energy. These charges relate to planned transmission project costs for which
recovery is not expected, and certain costs associated with mitigation sales
pursuant to merger settlement agreements with the FERC.  

  Partially offset by:   

A
$118 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power) primarily
related to higher sales volumes and increased prices of natural gas used in
electric generation, net of change in fuel mix, partially offset by decreased
purchased power due to additional generating capacity placed in service late
2012.  

    Gains on Sales of
Other Assets and Other, net.     The variance is due to recognition of gains
on the sale of emissions allowances in 2012.  

    Other Income and
Expense, net.     The
variance is primarily due to lower earnings from AFUDC equity, resulting from
major projects placed into service in late 2012, partially offset by higher
deferred returns on completed projects prior to their inclusion in customer
rates.  

45       

PART II  

Interest
Expense.    
The variance is primarily due to deferrals of debt costs on completed projects prior
to their inclusion in customer rates in September 2013, partially offset by
lower AFUDC debt due primarily to certain major projects that were placed into
service in late 2012.  

    Income Tax Expense     .    The variance was
primarily due to an increase in pretax book income. The effective tax rates for
the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 37.8 percent and 34.3 percent,
respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the
impact of lower AFUDC equity.  

    Matters

  On
February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke
Energy Carolinas  retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin
water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was
installed in the stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the

Results of Operations   

Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to
2012    

    Operating
Revenues.     
   The
variance was primarily due to:   

A
$167 million increase in base revenues at Duke Energy Florida as allowed by the
2012 Settlement;  

A
$136 million increase in wholesale sales at Duke Energy Progress (excluding
fuel revenues) primarily due to a new customer contract that began in January
2013, an amended capacity contract that began in May 2012 and favorable weather
conditions;  

A
$117 million increase at Duke Energy Progress due to revised rates in North
Carolina;  

A
$57 million increase in nuclear cost-recovery clause revenues at Duke Energy
Florida primarily due to an increase in recovery rates related to the Crystal
River Unit 3 uprate project, prior period true-ups, and Levy as allowed by the
2012 Settlement; and  

A
$24 million increase (net of fuel revenue) in GWh sales to retail customers at
Duke Energy Progress due to higher weather normal sales volumes to retail
customers.  

  Partially
offset by:   

A
$387 million decrease in retail fuel revenues at Duke Energy Florida primarily
due to the impact of lower residential fuel rates and a decrease in GWh retail
sales due to weather and lower usage.  

    Operating
Expenses.     
   The
variance was primarily due to:   

A
$482 million decrease in retail fuel expense at Duke Energy Florida primarily
due to the application of the NEIL settlement proceeds including amortization
associated with the 2012 Settlement, lower system requirements, and the prior
year establishment of a regulatory liability for replacement power in accordance
with the 2012 Settlement;   

A
$136 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses at Duke Energy
Progress primarily due to lower costs associated with the merger with Duke
Energy and the levelization of nuclear outage costs;   

A
$71 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses at Duke Energy
Florida primarily due to the deferral of Crystal River Unit 3-related expenses,
in accordance with the 2012 Settlement, lower costs associated with the merger
with Duke Energy, and the prior year write-off of previously deferred costs
related to the vendor not selected costs for the Crystal River Unit 3
containment repair. These were partially offset by the prior year reversal of
accruals in conjunction with the placement of Crystal River Unit 3 into
extended cold shutdown in accordance with the 2012 Settlement and higher
charges associated with related settlement matters; and  

A
$32 million decrease in impairment charges at Duke Energy Progress related to
the merger with Duke Energy. These charges relate to planned transmission
project costs for which recovery is not expected, and certain costs associated
with mitigation sales pursuant to merger settlement agreements with the FERC,
partially offset by a current
year impairment charge resulting from the decision to suspend the application
for two proposed nuclear units at Harris.  

  Partially offset by:  

47       

PART II  

A
$212 million increase in impairment and other charges at Duke Energy Florida.
In 2013, Duke Energy Florida recorded charges primarily related to Crystal
River Unit 3 and Levy. In 2012, Duke Energy Florida recorded impairment and
other charges related to the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3. See Note
4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for
additional information; and  

A
$138 million increase in depreciation and amortization at Duke Energy Florida
primarily due to higher nuclear cost-recovery amortization related to Levy and
a decrease in the reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization
expense as allowed under the 2012 Settlement.  

    Other Income and
Expenses, net     .
   The
variance was primarily due to lower AFUDC equity resulting from to major
projects placed in service in late 2012 and the retirement of Crystal River
Unit 3.  

    Interest Expense.         The variance was
primarily due to the deferral of debt costs recorded on the retail portion of
the retired Crystal River Unit 3 assets, partially offset by the charge to
interest expense on the redemption of Progress Energy s 7.10% Cumulative
Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS) in January 2013.   

    Income Tax Expense
from Continuing Operations.         The variance was primarily due to
an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 36.2 percent and 32.7 percent, respectively. The
increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of lower AFUDC
equity and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) dividend deduction being
recorded at Duke Energy in 2012.  

    Discontinued
Operations, net of tax.     The variance was primarily due to the impact
of the U.S. Global, LLC (Global) settlement in 2012. See Note 5 to the

respectively. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a
decrease in pretax income and a decrease in the manufacturing deduction in 2013.  

   Matters
Impacting Future Duke Energy Ohio Results   

  On
February 17, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio announced that it had initiated a process
to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing
period of several months and potential regulatory approvals, Duke Energy Ohio
expects to dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to
mid-2015. In the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio will reclassify
approximately $3.5 billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to
assets held for sale and expects to record an estimated pretax  impairment
charge of $1 billion to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated
sales proceeds less cost to sell.  

  In 2013, a FERC
Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision holding that Duke Energy
Ohio is responsible for certain MVP costs, a type of MTEP cost, approved by
MISO prior to the date of Duke Energy Ohio s withdrawal. The initial decision
will be reviewed by FERC. If FERC upholds the initial decision, Duke Energy
Ohio intends to file an appeal in federal court. If Duke Energy Ohio ultimately
is found to be responsible for these costs, a portion of these costs may not be
eligible for recovery, resulting in an adverse impact to its financial
position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  for additional information.

primarily driven by:   

A
$155 million net increase primarily related to updates to the IGCC rider, and  

A
$43 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) due to an
increase in fuel rates as a result of higher fuel and purchased power costs.  

    Operating Expenses.     The variance was
primarily driven by:   

A
$600 million decrease due to 2012 impairment and other charges related to the
Edwardsport IGCC plant, and  

A
$40 million decrease in depreciation expense due to a regulatory order related
to the Edwardsport IGCC settlement agreement.  

  Partially offset by:  

A
$43 million increase in fuel costs primarily driven by higher fuel and
purchased power costs.   

    Other Income and

primarily driven by a $30 million decrease in AFUDC debt primarily due to
updates to the IGCC rider in January 2013.  

    Income
Tax Expense (Benefit).     The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax
income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were
38.4 percent and 59.5 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax
was primarily due to pretax income in 2013 compared to pretax loss in 2012 primarily
resulting from the Edwardsport IGCC project impairment and the impact of AFUDC
equity in 2013 that reduced the tax expense compared to higher AFUDC in 2012 that
increased the tax benefit.

PART II  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND ESTIMATES    

Preparation of
financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, judgments,
assumptions and estimates that can significantly affect the reported results of
operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial
statements. Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular
projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of
costs.    

  Management discusses
these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on
a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the
audit committee of the Duke Energy board of directors. Management believes the
areas described below require significant judgment in the application of
accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently
uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.  

Regulatory Accounting    

A substantial majority
of Regulated Utilities, Duke Energy s regulated operations, meet the criteria
for application of regulatory accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy
records assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated
entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been
deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates.
Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds, or
reduce rates, to customers for previous collections or for costs that have yet
to be incurred.   

  Management continually
assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by
considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, historical
regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy s jurisdictions,
litigation of rate orders, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and
the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future
recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized
in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility
in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment,
recognition of nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory
assets or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets. Total
regulatory assets for Duke Energy were $10,086 million and $11,741 million as
of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Total regulatory liabilities were
$6,265 million and $5,740 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. For further information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements,  Regulatory Matters.    

  As required by
regulated operations accounting, significant judgment can be required to
determine if an otherwise recognizable cost is considered to be an entity
specific cost recoverable in future rates and therefore a regulatory asset.
Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized
are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred and
are therefore a regulatory liability.   

  Regulatory accounting
rules also require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that part of
the cost of a plant under construction (or a recently completed plant or an
abandoned plant) will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable
estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. For example, if a cost
cap is set, the amount of the disallowance is a result of a judgment as to the
ultimate cost of the plant. Other disallowances can require judgments on
allowed future rate recovery. As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters,  during 2012 and 2011 Duke Energy
Indiana recorded charges of $631 million and $222 million, respectively,
related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant. In 2013, Duke Energy Florida recorded a
charge of $295 million related to the retired Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear
Station. Also as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Acquisitions and Sales of Other Assets , Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy
Progress recorded disallowance charges in 2012 in order to gain FERC approval
of the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. Duke Energy Carolinas
and Duke Energy Progress guaranteed total fuel savings to customers in North
Carolina and South Carolina of $687 million over the five years in order to
gain NCUC and SCPSC approval of the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy.
Based on current estimates of future fuel costs, Duke Energy anticipates that
it will meet the guaranteed fuel savings. However, if actual fuel costs are
higher than expected, Duke Energy could record a charge for the unmet
guaranteed savings.  

Goodwill Impairment Assessments    

Duke Energy s goodwill
balances by segment are included in the following table.   

During 2012, Duke
Energy recorded $12,469 million of goodwill associated with the merger with
Progress Energy. This goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over
the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the
acquisition date, and was allocated entirely to the Regulated Utilities
segment. The remainder of Regulated Utilities  goodwill relates to the
acquisition of Cinergy in April 2006.   

  Duke Energy allocates
goodwill to reporting units, which are a subset of the business segments and
are determined based on how the segment is managed. Duke Energy is required to
test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and
more frequently if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Duke Energy performs its annual
impairment test as of August 31.   

  Application of the
goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including determining
the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a
weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based
on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value
based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries.
Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and
growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate      

56       

PART II  

regulation, utility sector market performance and
transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for Duke Energy s
business and the fair value of debt.  

  Estimated future cash
flows under the income approach are based to a large extent on Duke Energy s
internal business plan, and adjusted as appropriate for Duke Energy s views of
market participant assumptions. Duke Energy s internal business plan reflects
management s assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on
internal data and economic data obtained from third-party sources, projected
commodity pricing data and potential changes in environmental regulations. The
business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as
the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of returns on equity,
anticipated earnings/returns related to significant future capital investments,
continued recovery of cost of service, the renewal of certain contracts and the
future of renewable tax credits. Management also makes assumptions regarding
operation, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the
expected outcome of the aforementioned events. In estimating cash flows, Duke
Energy incorporates expected growth rates, regulatory and economic stability,
the ability to renew contracts and other factors, into its revenue and expense
forecasts.   

  One of the most
significant assumptions that Duke Energy utilizes in determining the fair value
of its reporting units under the income approach is the discount rate applied
to the estimated future cash flows. Management determines the appropriate
discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the weighted average cost
of capital (WACC) for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into
account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component
of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on twenty-year U.S.
Treasury bonds. In the 2013 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied
WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to
use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based
on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC
for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as
appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. For example, Duke
Energy Ohio s transmission and distribution reporting unit generally would have
a lower company specific risk premium as it does not have the higher level of
risk associated with owning and operating generation assets nor does it have
significant construction risk or risk associated with potential future carbon
legislation or pending EPA regulations. The discount rates used for calculating
the fair values as of August 31, 2013, for each of Duke Energy s domestic
reporting units ranged from 5.4 percent to 7.4 percent.   

  For Duke Energy s
international operations, a country specific risk adder based on the average
risk premium for each separate country in which International Energy operates
was added to the base discount rate to reflect the differing risk profiles.
This resulted in a discount rate for the August 31, 2013 goodwill impairment
test for the international operations of 10.6 percent.  

  The underlying
assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes,
particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of
return or growth rates inherent in management s estimates of future cash flows,
could result in future impairment charges.   

  The majority of Duke
Energy s business is in environments that are either fully or partially
rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted
periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales
volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy s regulated utilities
operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or
negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However,
changes in discount rates may have a significant impact on the fair value of
equity.   

  As of August 31, 2013,
all of the reporting units  estimated fair value of equity exceeded the
carrying value of equity by more than 10 percent.  

  The fair value of
Commercial Power s Renewables reporting unit is impacted by a multitude of
factors, including legislative actions related to tax credit extensions,
long-term growth rate assumptions, the market price of power and discount
rates. As of December 31, 2013, the Renewables reporting unit s estimated fair
value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity. Duke Energy continues to
monitor these assumptions for any indicators that the fair value of the
reporting unit could be below the carrying value, and will assess goodwill for
impairment as appropriate.  

Long-Lived
Asset Impairment Assessments    

Property, plant and
equipment is stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated
depreciation or fair value, if impaired. Duke Energy evaluates property, plant
and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a
significant change in cash flow projections, the determination that it is more
likely than not an asset or asset group will be sold, or a regulating body with
authority to set rates Duke Energy charges to customers approves an order
disallowing recovery of costs incurred or to be incurred) indicate the carrying
value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an
impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash
flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value, except
when applied to regulated plant costs that are disallowed for ratemaking
purposes. The impairment for a disallowance of costs for regulated plants under
construction, recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash flows.
See  Regulatory Accounting  for information related to accounting for rate
regulated operations.   

  Performing an
impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment
in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may
exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the
undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. If an impairment has
occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating
the fair value of the asset and recording a loss if the carrying value is
greater than the fair value. Additionally, determining fair value of the asset
requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about
possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an
appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant
information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future
cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from
actual results. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is
compared to the estimated fair value less cost to sell to determine if an
impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated
fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.   

  When determining
whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at
the lowest level that has discrete cash flows. For regulated entities, the
lowest level with discrete cash flows is generally the operating utility level.  

  When it becomes
probable that regulated generation, transmission or distribution assets will be
abandoned, the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service. The value
that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned
property is dependent upon      

57       

PART II  

amounts that may be
recovered through regulated rates, including any return. As such, an impairment
charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate
recovery is probable.   

  As discussed further
in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Acquisitions,
Dispositions, and Sales of Other Assets,  in the first quarter of 2014, Duke
Energy Ohio announced it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated
Midwest generation business. As a result, Duke Energy expects to classify the
Midwest generation business as held for sale and record an estimated pretax
impairment charge of $1 billion to $2 billion in the first quarter of
2014. As discussed further in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Acquisitions, Dispositions, and Sales of Other Assets,  in the third quarter
of 2012, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recorded certain
impairment charges in conjunction with the merger between Duke Energy and
Progress Energy. As discussed further in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements,  Goodwill and Intangible Assets,  in the third quarter of 2011,
Commercial Power recorded $79 million of pretax impairment charges related to CAA
emission allowances that were no longer expected to be used as a result of the
issuance of the final CSAPR. These impairment charges are recorded in Goodwill
and Other Impairment Charges on Duke Energy s Consolidated Statement of
Operations.   

Accounting for Loss Contingencies    

Preparation of
financial statements and related disclosures require judgments regarding the
future outcome of contingent events. Duke Energy is involved in certain legal
and environmental matters arising in the normal course of business. Estimating
probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts and scenarios that
often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties, such as
federal, state and local courts and other regulators. Contingent liabilities are
often resolved over long periods of time. Amounts recorded in the consolidated
financial statements may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is
resolved, which could have a material impact on future results of operations,
financial position and cash flows of Duke Energy.   

  For further
information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments
and Contingencies.    

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits    

The calculation of
pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and
other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and
election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes in assumptions can
result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts, and future
actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes the
most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount
rate. Additionally, medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions
are critical to Duke Energy s estimates of other post-retirement benefits.   

  Duke Energy elects to
amortize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor of 10 percent
of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan projected
benefit obligation, into net pension or other post-retirement benefit expense
over the average remaining service period of active covered employees. Prior
service cost or credit, which represents the effect on plan liabilities due to
plan amendments, is amortized over the average remaining service period of
active covered employees.  

  Duke Energy maintains
non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. The plans cover most U.S.
employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan
participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based
upon a percentage of current eligible earnings based on age and years of
service and current interest credits. Certain employees are covered under plans
that use a final average earnings formula.   

  Duke Energy provides
some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a
contributory and non-contributory basis. Certain employees are eligible for
these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as
defined in the plans.   

  For both pension and
other post-retirement plans, Duke Energy assumes its plan s assets will
generate a long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent as of December 31, 2013.
The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average
calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns
across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where
applicable. U.S. equities are held for their high expected return. Non-U.S.
equities, debt securities, hedge funds, real estate and other global securities
are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are to be
diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of
individual managers on investments. In September 2013, Duke Energy adopted a
de-risking investment strategy for its pension plan assets. As the funded
status of the Duke Energy and Progress Energy pension plans increase, over time
the allocation to return-seeking assets will be reduced and the allocation to
fixed-income assets will be increased to better manage Duke Energy s pension
liability and reduce funded status volatility. Based on the current funded
status of the plans, the asset allocation for the Duke Energy pension plans has
been adjusted to 60 percent fixed-income assets and 40 percent return-seeking
assets and the asset allocation for the Progress Energy pension plans has been
adjusted to 55 percent fixed-income assets and 45 percent return-seeking
assets.  

  The assets for Duke
Energy s pension and other post-retirement plans are maintained in a master
trust.  Duke Energy also invests other post-retirement assets in the Duke
Energy Corporation Employee Benefits Trust (VEBA I). The investment objective
of VEBA I is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of
portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for
participants. VEBA I is passively managed.    

  Duke Energy discounted
its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of
4.7 percent as of December 31, 2013. Discount rates used to measure benefit
plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect rates at which
pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of December 31, 2013, Duke
Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other post-retirement
obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach
develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate
bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to match the timing of projected
benefit payments. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of
non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond
portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the
present value of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate
with the market value of the bonds selected.   

  Future changes in plan
asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants
in Duke Energy s pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension
expense and liabilities. Duke Energy cannot predict with certainty what these
factors will      

58       

PART II  

be in the future. The following table
presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy s 2013 pretax pension expense,
pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25
percent change in rates were to occur.  

Duke Energy s U.S.
post-retirement plan uses a medical care trend rate which reflects the near and
long-term expectation of increases in medical health care costs. Duke Energy s
U.S. post-retirement plan uses a prescription drug trend rate, which reflects
the near and long-term expectation of increases in prescription drug health care
costs. As of December 31, 2013, the medical care trend rates were 8.5 percent,
which grades to 5.00 percent by 2021. The following table presents the
approximate effect on Duke Energy s 2013 pretax other post-retirement expense
and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 1 percentage point change in
the health care trend rate were to occur.

PART II  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    

Sources
and Uses of Cash   

Duke Energy relies
primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt issuances and its existing cash
and cash equivalents to fund its domestic liquidity and capital requirements.
Duke Energy s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment
expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders.
Duke Energy s projected primary sources and uses for the next three fiscal
years are included in the table below.  

The Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain
minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working
capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants,
excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through
participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money
pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term
loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,  Debt and Credit Facilities,  for additional
discussion of the money pool arrangement.  

  Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants,
excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial
paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels
of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the
timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash
flows from operations. Duke Energy s current liabilities frequently exceed
current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to
meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can
fluctuate due to the seasonality of its business.  

   Credit Facilities and Registration
Statements   

   Master Credit Facility Summary   

  Duke
Energy has a master credit facility with a capacity of $6 billion through
December 2018. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy each have
borrowing capacity under the master credit facility up to specified sublimits
for each borrower. Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to
increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a
maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount available under the master
credit facility has been reduced to backstop the issuances of commercial paper,
certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be
put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder. The table below
includes the current borrowing sublimits and available capacity under the
master credit facility.  

PremierNotes   

  Duke
Energy has an effective Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to $3 billion of
variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form
S-3 states that no more than $1.5 billion of the notes will be outstanding at
any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear
interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy
PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate
payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of
the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable
and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investor s
option at any time. The balance as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, was
$836 million and $395 million, respectively. The notes are short-term debt
obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper
on Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

60       

PART II  

Shelf Registration   

  In September 2013, Duke Energy filed a Form
S-3 with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, the Duke Energy
Registrants, excluding Progress Energy may issue debt and other securities in
the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of
future offerings. The registration statement also allows for the issuance of
common stock by Duke Energy.   

   CAPITAL EXPENDITURES   

  Duke Energy s
projected capital and investment expenditures for the next three fiscal years
are included in the table below.  

DEBT
MATURITIES   

  The following table
shows the significant components of Current maturities of long-term debt on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Duke Energy Registrants currently anticipate
satisfying these obligations, primarily with cash on hand and proceeds from
additional borrowings.  

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS   

  Duke
Energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for 88 consecutive years and expects
to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is
no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future
earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the
discretion of the Board of Directors.   

  Over
the past several years, Duke Energy s dividend has grown at approximately two
percent annually, slower than overall earnings growth. The Board of Directors
continues to target a payout ratio of 65 percent to 70 percent, based upon
adjusted diluted EPS. Once the dividend is within the target payout ratio, Duke
Energy believes it has the flexibility to grow the dividend at a pace more
consistent with earnings growth.   

   Dividend and Other
Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries   

  As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements  Regulatory Matters , Duke Energy s wholly owned public
utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can
be transferred to Duke Energy via dividend, advance or loan as a result of
conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger
transactions. Duke Energy   Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have
restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of
Incorporation which, in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash
dividends or distributions on common stock.   Additionally, certain other Duke Energy
subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and
tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that
limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31,
2013, the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke
Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or
dividend is less than 25 percent of Duke Energy s consolidated net assets. Duke
Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock
dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although
these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries
can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will
have any significant impact on Duke Energy s ability to access cash to meet its
payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations.  

61       

PART II  

CASH FLOWS FROM
OPERATING ACTIVITIES   

  The
relatively stable operating cash flows of Regulated Utilities compose a
substantial portion of Duke Energy s cash flows from operations. Regulated
Utilities  cash flows from operations are primarily driven by sales of
electricity and natural gas and costs of operations. Weather conditions,
commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses, including unplanned
plant outages and storms can affect the timing and level of cash flows from
operations. Duke Energy provides the liquidity support for Commercial Power s
coal-fired and gas-fired assets that are dispatched into the PJM wholesale
market. Commercial Power has economically hedged a portion of its forecasted
generation through 2018 with various counterparties, and a substantial portion
of these contracts require daily posting of margin, which can be significant.
Duke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the
commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the master credit facility, to
support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of
other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic
trends and market volatility (see Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  for additional
information).   

  At
December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments of $1.5 billion, of which $1.1 billion is held by entities
domiciled in foreign jurisdictions and is forecasted to be used to fund the
operations of and investments in International Energy. Undistributed foreign
earnings associated with International Energy s operations are considered
indefinitely reinvested. As a result, no U.S. tax is recorded on such earnings.
This assertion is based on management s determination that the cash held in International
Energy s foreign jurisdictions is not needed to fund the operations of its U.S.
operations and that International Energy either has invested or has intentions
to reinvest such earnings. While management currently intends to indefinitely
reinvest all of International Energy s unremitted earnings, should
circumstances change, Duke Energy may need to record additional income tax
expense in the period in which such determination changes. The cumulative
undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2013, on which Duke Energy has not
provided deferred U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes is
approximately $2.4 billion. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability
related to these undistributed earnings is estimated at between $300 million
and $375 million. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Income
Taxes,  for additional information.  

   DEBT ISSUANCES   

  Depending
on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing
entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first
mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is
the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and
secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy
Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt.   

  Duke Energy s
capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below.
The 2014 projected capitalization percentages exclude purchase accounting
adjustments related to the merger with Progress Energy.  

Duke Energy s fixed
charges coverage ratio, calculated using SEC guidelines, was 3.0 times for 2013,
2.5 times for 2012, and 3.2 times for 2011.  

   Restrictive
Debt Covenants   

  Duke Energy s debt and
credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. The master credit
facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio
to not exceed 65 percent for each borrower. Failure to meet those covenants
beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or
termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. As of
December 31, 2013, Duke Energy was in compliance with all covenants
related to its significant debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements
may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to
nonpayment, or to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the
borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements
contain material adverse change clauses.  

   Credit
Ratings   

  Duke Energy and
certain subsidiaries each hold credit ratings by Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch),
Moody s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s) and Standard   Poor s Rating
Services (S P). Duke Energy s corporate credit rating and issuer credit
rating from Fitch, Moody s and S P, respectively, as of February 13, 2013
is BBB+, A3 and BBB+, respectively. As of February 13, 2014, the Duke
Energy Registrants  have stable outlooks from Fitch, Moody s and S P.

For the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012, the
  variance was driven primarily by:  

A $2,001 million increase in net income after non-cash
  adjustments, mainly due to the inclusion of Progress Energy's results for
  first six months of 2013 and the impact of revised rates  and lower operation
  and maintenance expenses, partially offset by;  

A $917 million decrease in operating cash flows from increased
  investments in traditional working capital, mainly due to the timing of
  receivables and accruals, lower incentive accruals, net of current year
  payments and reserve reductions and the prior year overallocation of the
  Carolinas' fuels costs. These decreases were partially offset by the NEIL
  proceeds.  

For the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 2011, the
  variance was driven primarily by:  

An approximately $1,210 million increase in net income after
  non-cash adjustments (depreciation and amortizations, higher Edwardsport
  charges, severance expense and other Progress Energy merger related costs),
  resulting from the inclusion of  Progress Energy's results beginning July 2,
  2012 and the impact of the 2011 North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases,
  net of unfavorable weather.  

A $560 million increase in operating cash flows from lower
  investment in traditional working capital, mainly due to an increase in
  current year vacation and incentive accruals and prior year refund of North
  Carolina overcollected fuels costs and current year overcollection of North
  Carolina and South Carolina fuel costs, partially offset by;  

A $100 million increase in contributions to company sponsored
  pension plans due to contributions for Progress Energy pension plans.

A $581 million variance in restricted cash due to posting
  collateral on a secured debt issuance related to the Chilean hydro acquisition
  in 2012 and the return of a portion of this collateral in 2013,  

A $355 million increase in proceeds from the sales of
  available-for-sale securities, net of purchases due to the investment of
  excess cash held in foreign jurisdictions and  

A $351 million decrease in capital, investment and acquisition
  expenditures primarily due to lower spending on Duke Energy's renewable
  energy projects and ongoing infrastructure modernization program as these projects
  were completed, net of expenditures on Progress Energy's maintenance
  projects.  

For the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 2011, the
  variance was driven primarily by:  

A $1,490 million increase in capital, investment and acquisition
  expenditures primarily due to the inclusion of Progress Energy's capital
  expenditures beginning July 2, 2012, higher expenditures on renewable energy
  projects and the Chilean hydro acquisition, net of lower spending on Duke
  Energy's ongoing infrastructure modernization program as these projects near
  completion and  

A $440 million increase in restricted cash primarily due to a
  secured debt issuance related to Chilean hydro acquisition.

For the year ended
  December 31, 2013 compared to 2012, the variance was driven primarily by:  

A $832 million decrease
  in net issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to the timing of issuances
  and redemptions between years, resulting from the completion of major
  construction projects,  

A $436 million increase
  in quarterly dividends primarily due to an increase in common shares
  outstanding, resulting from the merger with Progress Energy and an increase
  in dividends per share from $0.765 to $0.78 in the third quarter of 2013. The
  total annual dividend per share was $3.09 in 2013 compared to $3.03 in 2012
  and  

A $185 million decrease
  in proceeds from net issuances of notes payable and commercial paper,
  primarily due to changes in short-term working capital needs.  

For the year ended
  December 31, 2012 compared to 2011, the variance was driven primarily by:  

A $620 million decrease
  in net issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to the timing of issuances and
  redemptions between years and  

A $420 million increase
  in quarterly dividends primarily due to an increase in common shares
  outstanding, resulting from the merger with Progress Energy and an increase
  in dividends per share from $0.75 to $0.765 in the third quarter of 2012. The
  total annual dividend per share was $3.03 in 2012 compared to $2.97 in 2011;  

These decreases in cash
  provided were partially offset by:  

A $70 million increase in
  proceeds from net issuances of notes payable and commercial paper, primarily
  due to the PremierNotes program, net of paydown of commercial paper.

PART II  

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements    

Duke Energy and
certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal
course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties.
These arrangements include performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit,
debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.   

  Most of the guarantee
arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance the credit standing of certain
subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities,
enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve
elements of performance and credit risk, which are not always included on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of Duke Energy, either on its own
or on behalf of Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Capital) through
indemnification agreements entered into as part of the January 2, 2007 spin-off
of Spectra Energy Corp (Spectra Energy), having to honor its contingencies is
largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and
other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events.   

  Duke Energy performs
ongoing assessments of their respective guarantee obligations to determine
whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased
non-performance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued
guarantees.  

  See Note 7 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements,  Guarantees and Indemnifications,  for further details of
the guarantee arrangements.   

  Issuance of these
guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy s operations.
Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be
a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or
financial position.   

  Other than the
guarantee arrangements discussed above and normal operating lease arrangements,
Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or
structures. For additional information on these commitments, see Note 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies.

  for the life of the instruments.  

(c)  

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
   Commitments and Contingencies.  Amounts in the table above include the
  interest component of capital leases based on the interest rates stated in
  the lease agreements and exclude certain related executory costs.  

(d)  

Current liabilities, except for current maturities of long-term
  debt, and purchase obligations reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
  have been excluded from the above table.  

(e)  

Includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with
  uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity and natural
  gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts
  that qualify as normal purchase/normal sale (NPNS). For contracts where the
  price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on market prices at
  December 31, 2013. For certain of these amounts, Duke Energy may settle on a
  net cash basis since Duke Energy has entered into payment netting
  arrangements with counterparties that permit Duke Energy to offset
  receivables and payables with such counterparties.  

(f)  

Includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting
  or advisory services. Amount also includes contractual obligations for
  engineering, procurement and construction costs for new generation plants and
  nuclear plant refurbishments, environmental projects on fossil facilities,
  major maintenance of certain nonregulated plants, maintenance and day to day
  contract work at certain wind facilities and commitments to buy wind and
  combustion turbines. Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for
  services that are provided on demand, for which the timing of the purchase
  cannot be determined.  

(g)  

Related to future annual funding obligations to nuclear
  decommissioning trust fund (NDTF) through nuclear power stations' re-licensing
  dates. Amounts through 2017 include North Carolina jurisdictional amounts
  that Duke Energy Progress retained internally and is transitioning to its
  external decommissioning funds per a 2008 NCUC order. The transition of the
  original $131 million must be complete by December 31, 2017, and at least 10
  percent must be transitioned each year. See Note 9 to the Consolidated
  Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement Obligations.   

(h)  

Uncertain tax positions of $230 million are not reflected in
  this table as Duke Energy cannot predict when open income tax years will
  close with completed examinations. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial
  Statements,  Income Taxes.   

(i)  

The table above excludes reserves for litigation, environmental
  remediation, asbestos-related injuries and damages claims and self-insurance
  claims (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and
  Contingencies ) because Duke Energy is uncertain as to the timing of when
  cash payments will be required. Additionally, the table above excludes annual
  insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business, including
  nuclear insurance (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
   Commitments and Contingencies ), funding of pension and other post-retirement
  benefit plans (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
   Employee Benefit Plans ), asset retirement obligations (see Note 9
  to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement Obligations ) and regulatory liabilities (see Note
  4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory Matters ) because the
  amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. Also excluded are
  Deferred Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits recorded on the Consolidated
  Balance Sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based
  primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year.

PART II  

QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

Risk
Management Policies   

Duke
Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest
rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Duke Energy has
established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these
market risks. Duke Energy s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and
the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk
Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from
the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk
positions, corporate exposures, and overall risk management activities. The
Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing
commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.   

  The
following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that
involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially
from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Please review Item 1A,
 Risk Factors,  and  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking
statements made herein.  

Commodity Price Risk   

Duke
Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of
electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and
purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets. Duke Energy s
exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost-based regulation of its
operations in its Regulated Utilities segment as these operations are typically
allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various
cost-recovery clauses, including fuel clauses. While there may be a delay in
timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered
through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material
impact on operating results of these regulated operations.   

  Price
risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market
price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy s exposure to
commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract
size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms.
Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks
associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various
commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional
information, see Note     14
to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Derivatives and Hedging.    

  Validation
of a contract s fair value is performed by an internal group separate from Duke
Energy s deal origination function. While Duke Energy uses common industry
practices to develop its valuation techniques, changes in its pricing
methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly
different fair values and income recognition.   

    HEDGING
STRATEGIES    

  Duke
Energy closely monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its
future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments
such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the
effect of such fluctuations on operations. These instruments are also used to
optimize the value of the nonregulated generation portfolio. Duke Energy s
primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation
portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel.   

  The
majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy s commodity price exposure
are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting.
These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market
changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are
reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are
marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative
instruments reflected in earnings.   

  Duke
Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception.
When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as an NPNS, Duke Energy applies
such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts
generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts
qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract s fair value
in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the
contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.   

    GENERATION
PORTFOLIO RISKS    

Duke
Energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power,
natural gas, and coal prices in the Regulated Utilities and Commercial Power
segments. The Duke Energy Registrants optimize the value of their       wholesale
and nonregulated generation portfolios. The portfolios include generation
assets, fuel, and emission allowances. Modeled forecasts of future generation
output and fuel requirements are based on forward power and fuel markets. The
component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and
forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio
in accordance with the strategies of the business units. For the Regulated
Utilities segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail
operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations.
However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is partially
offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the
sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers. The
Commercial Power nonregulated generation portfolio dispatches all of its
electricity into unregulated markets on a day-ahead and real-time basis and
receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from PJM. Commercial
Power has economically hedged its forecasted coal-fired generation and a
significant portion of its forecasted gas-fired generation for 2014. Commercial
Power also has long-term economic hedges in place for a portion of expected
coal and gas generation through 2017 and 2018, respectively. Capacity revenues
are 100 percent fixed in PJM through May 2017. International Energy generally
hedges its expected generation using long-term bilateral power sales contracts
when favorable market conditions exist and it is subject to wholesale commodity
price risks for electricity not sold under such contracts. International Energy
dispatches electricity not sold under long-term bilateral contracts into
unregulated markets and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues
from       national system operators. Derivative contracts executed to manage
generation portfolio risks for delivery periods beyond 2014 are also       exposed
to changes in fair value due to market price fluctuations of       wholesale
power, fuel oil and coal. See  Sensitivity Analysis for Generation Portfolio
and Derivative Price Risks  below, for more information regarding the effect of
changes in commodity prices on Duke Energy s net income.   

    SENSITIVITY
ANALYSIS FOR GENERATION PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE PRICE RISKS    

68       

PART II  

The table below summarizes the estimated
effect of commodity price changes on Duke Energy s pretax net income, based on
a sensitivity analysis performed for the nonregulated generation portfolio.
Forecasted exposure to commodity price risk for the Regulated Utilities segment
is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on Duke Energy s results
of operations in 2014. The following commodity price sensitivity calculations
consider existing hedge positions and estimated production levels, as indicated
in the table below, but do not consider other potential effects that might
result from such changes in commodity prices.

Amounts related to forward wholesale prices represent the
  potential impact of commodity price changes on forecasted economic generation
  which has not been contracted or hedged. Amounts related to forward coal
  prices and forward gas prices represent the potential impact of commodity
  price changes on fuel needed to achieve such economic generation. Amounts
  exclude the impact of mark-to-market changes on undesignated contracts
  relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date.       

(b)  

Amounts represent sensitivities related to derivative contracts
  executed to manage generation portfolio risks for periods beyond 2013.
  Amounts exclude the potential impact of commodity price changes on forecasted
  economic generation and fuel needed to achieve such forecasted generation.       

Interest Rate Risk    

Duke
Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result
of its issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke
Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a
percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in
interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments,
which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps,
swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest
rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 6, 14, and 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,   Debt and Credit
Facilities,   Derivatives and Hedging,  and  Fair Value Measurements.    

  The
paragraph below summarizes the potential effect of interest rate changes on the
Duke Energy Registrants  pretax net income, based on a sensitivity analysis
performed as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.  

  At
December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had no notional amounts of fixed-to-floating
hedges outstanding and no pre-issuance hedges outstanding. The weighted average
interest rate on $5,677 million of long-term and short-term variable interest
rate exposure that has not been hedged at December 31, 2013 was 1.45 percent.  

  These
amounts were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest
rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate
hedges, short-term and long-term investments, cash and cash equivalents
outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. The change in interest rate
sensitivity for Duke Energy is primarily due to changes in short-term debt
balances and cash balances. If interest rates changed significantly, Duke
Energy would likely take actions to manage its exposure to the change. However,
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their
possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in Duke Energy s
financial structure.   

Marketable Securities
Price Risk    

As
described further in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,  Duke Energy invests in debt and
equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain
obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within
the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit
plans.   

    PENSION PLAN ASSETS    

  Duke Energy maintains investments to help
fund the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and
other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price
fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity
securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market
participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or
geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its
pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives
and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held.  

  A
significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke
Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could
adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the
fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan,
could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods,
which could adversely affect Duke Energy s results of operations in those
periods.   

    NDTF    

  As required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC,
subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear
decommissioning. As of December 31, 2013, these funds were invested primarily
in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, fixed-income
securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal
Revenue Code,NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only
for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. The investments in equity
securities are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. Duke Energy actively
monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments
against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target
allocation percentages for various asset classes. Accounting for nuclear
decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail rates; therefore,
fluctuations in equity prices do not affect their Consolidated Statements of
Operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are deferred as
regulatory assets or

regulatory liabilities pursuant
to an Order by the NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC. Earnings or losses of the fund will
ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail rates. See Note 9
to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Asset Retirement Obligations  for
additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 15 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities  for additional information regarding NDTF assets.   

Foreign Currency Risk    

Duke
Energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international
businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain
commodity-related transactions within domestic operations that are denominated
in foreign currencies. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency
fluctuations, contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the
U.S. Dollar and/or local inflation rates, or investments may be naturally
hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency. Duke Energy
may also use foreign currency derivatives, where possible, to manage its risk
related to foreign currency fluctuations. To monitor its currency exchange rate
risks, Duke Energy uses sensitivity analysis, which measures the impact of
devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure.   

  Duke
Energy s primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the Brazilian Real. The
table below summarizes the potential effect of foreign currency devaluations on
Duke Energy s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance
Sheets, based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2013
and December 31, 2012.

OTHER
ISSUES   

Fixed
Charges Coverage Ratios   

The Duke Energy
Registrants  fixed charges coverage ratios, as calculated using SEC guidelines,
are included in the table below.   

Dan River Ash Basin Release   

On February 2, 2014, a
break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas 
retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash
into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the
stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy
Carolinas estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24 million to 27 million
gallons of basin water were released into the river.  

  Duke
Energy cannot reasonably estimate the cost associated with remediation of this
release at this time. Other costs related to the Dan River release and other
ash basins, including   regulatory directives, natural
resources damages, future lawsuits, future claims, long-term environmental impact
costs, long-term operational changes, and costs associated with new laws and
regulations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.      

Global Climate Change   

The Duke Energy
Registrants  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions consist primarily of CO 2 
with most coming from their fleet of coal-fired power plants in the U.S. In 2013,
the Duke Energy Registrants  U.S. power plants emitted approximately 134 million
tons of CO 2 . CO 2  emissions from Duke Energy s
international operations were approximately 3 million tons. The Duke Energy
Registrants  future CO 2  emissions will be influenced by variables
including new regulations, economic conditions that affect electricity demand,
and the Duke Energy Registrants  decisions regarding generation technologies
deployed to meet customer electricity needs.  

  The Duke Energy
Registrants do not anticipate any of the states in which they currently operate
fossil-fueled electric generating units to implement requirements to reduce CO 2 
emissions absent a federal requirement to mandate reductions in GHG emissions.
On June 25, 2013, the President of the United States issued a memorandum
directing the EPA to propose CO 2  emissions requirements for existing
fossil-fuel      

70       

PART II  

electric generating units by June 1, 2014,
and to finalize the guidelines for states to develop their own regulations for
implementing the guidelines by June 1, 2015. The memorandum directed the EPA to
require state to submit their implementation regulations for approval by June
30, 2016.  

  The Duke Energy
Registrants are taking actions that will result in reduced GHG emissions over
time. These actions will lower the Duke Energy Registrants  exposure to any
future mandatory GHG emission reduction requirements or carbon tax, whether a
result of federal legislation or EPA regulation. Under any future scenario
involving mandatory GHG limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to
seek recovery of compliance costs associated with their regulated operations through
appropriate regulatory mechanisms.  

  The Duke Energy
Registrants recognize certain groups associate severe weather events with
climate change, and forecast the possibility these weather events could have a
material impact on future results of operations should they occur more
frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of
potential changes of extreme weather events (such as increased frequency,
duration, and severity), the long period of time over which any potential
changes might take place, and the inability to predict these with any degree of
accuracy, make estimating any potential future financial risk to the Duke
Energy Registrants  impossible. Currently, the Duke Energy Registrants plan and
prepare for extreme weather events they experience from time to time, such as
ice storms, tornados, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, high winds and
droughts.  

  The Duke Energy
Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe
weather events on their electric distribution systems. The Duke Energy
Registrants  electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme
weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain
an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effects of any potential
short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers
with an uninterrupted supply of electricity. The Duke Energy Registrants have a
program in place to effectively manage the impact of future droughts on their
operations.  

Other EPA Regulations Recently Published and Under
Development    

The EPA has issued and
is in various stages of developing several non-greenhouse gas (non-GHG)
environmental regulations that will affect the Duke Energy Registrants. These
include the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for hazardous air
pollutants, which is effective beginning in 2015, as well as proposed
regulations for cooling water intake structures under the Clean Water Act
316(b), coal combustion residuals, and steam effluent limitation guidelines. As
a group, these non-GHG environmental regulations will require the Duke Energy
Registrants to install additional environmental controls and accelerate
retirement of some coal-fired units. While the ultimate regulatory requirements
for the Duke Energy Registrants from the group of EPA regulatory actions will
not be known until all the rules have been finalized, for planning purposes,
the Duke Energy Registrants currently estimate the cost of new control
equipment that may need to be installed to comply with this group of rules
could total $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, excluding AFUDC, over the next 10
years. This range includes estimated costs for new control equipment necessary
to comply with the MATS of $525 million to $625 million. The Duke Energy
Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and
maintenance, and other expenses in conjunction with the non-GHG regulations. The
Duke Energy Registrants are planning to retire coal-fired generating capacity
that is not economic to bring into compliance with the EPA s regulations. Beyond 2013, total
planned and potential retirements could exceed 2,400 MW of coal-fired
generating capacity.
The Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur costs for replacement
generation as a result of the potential coal-fired power plant retirements. Until
the final regulatory requirements of the group of EPA regulations are known and
can be fully evaluated, the potential compliance costs associated with these
EPA regulatory actions are subject to considerable uncertainty. Therefore, the
actual compliance costs incurred and MW to be retired may be materially
different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the
final EPA regulations.  

  For additional
information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Regulatory
Matters  and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and
Contingencies.   

Nuclear Matters   

Following
the events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in Japan, Duke Energy
conducted thorough inspections at each of its seven nuclear sites during 2011.
The initial inspections did not identify any significant vulnerabilities,
however, Duke Energy is reviewing designs to evaluate safety margins to
external events. Emergency-response capabilities, written procedures and
engineering specifications were reviewed to verify each site s ability to
respond in the unlikely event of station blackout. Duke Energy is working
within the nuclear industry to improve safety standards and margin using the
three layers of safety approach used in the U.S.: protection, mitigation and
emergency response. Emergency equipment is currently being added at each
station to perform key safety functions in the event that backup power sources
are lost permanently. These improvements are in addition to the numerous layers
of safety measures and systems previously in place.  

  In
March 2011, the NRC formed a task force to conduct a comprehensive review of
processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make
additional improvements to the nuclear regulatory system. On July 13, 2011, the
task force proposed a set of improvements designed to ensure protection,
enhance accident mitigation, strengthen emergency preparedness and improve
efficiency of NRC programs. The recommendations were further prioritized into
three tiers based on the safety enhancement level. On March 12, 2012, the NRC
issued three regulatory orders requiring safety enhancements related to
mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the
loss of power at a plant, ensuring reliable hardened containment vents and
enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation.  

  On
August 30, 2012, the NRC issued implementation guidance to enable power plants
to achieve compliance with the orders issued in March 2012. Plants were required
to submit implementation plans to the NRC by February 28, 2013, and complete
implementation of the safety enhancements within two refueling outages or by
December 31, 2016, whichever comes first. Each plant is also required to
reassess their seismic and flooding hazards using present-day methods and
information, conduct inspections to ensure protection against hazards in the
current design basis, and re-evaluate emergency communications systems and
staffing levels.  

  Duke
Energy is committed to compliance with all safety enhancements ordered by the
NRC in connection with the March 12, 2012, regulatory orders noted above, the
cost of which could be material. Until such time as the NRC-mandated
reassessment of flooding and seismic hazards is complete the exact scope and
cost of compliance modifications to Duke Energy s sites will not be known. With
the NRC s continuing review of the remaining recommendations, Duke Energy
cannot predict to what extent the NRC will impose additional licensing and
safety-related requirements, or the costs of complying with such requirements.
Upon receipt of additional guidance from the NRC and a collaborative

industry review, Duke Energy will be able to determine an
implementation plan and associated costs. See Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  for

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    

  To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of  

  Duke
Energy Corporation   

  Charlotte,
North Carolina   

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the
 Company ) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2013. We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal
Control   Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an
opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits.  

  We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.   

  A company's internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.   

  Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also,
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   

  In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of December
31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013,
based on the criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework
(1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

  Charlotte,
North Carolina  

  We have audited the accompanying balance
sheets of Duke Energy Florida, Inc. (the  Company ) as of December
31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive
income, changes in common stockholder s equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  

  We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

  In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Duke Energy Florida, Inc. at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Nature
of Operations and Basis of Consolidation   

  Duke
Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy), is an
energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to
regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Duke Energy operates
in the U.S. and Latin America primarily through its direct and indirect
subsidiaries. Duke Energy s subsidiaries include its wholly owned subsidiary
registrants, Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy Carolinas); Progress
Energy, Inc. (Progress Energy); Duke Energy Progress, Inc. (Duke Energy
Progress); Duke Energy Florida, Inc. (Duke Energy Florida); Duke Energy Ohio, Inc.
(Duke Energy Ohio) and Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. (Duke Energy Indiana). When
discussing Duke Energy s consolidated financial information, it necessarily
includes the results of its six separate subsidiary registrants (collectively
referred to as the Subsidiary Registrants), which, along with Duke Energy, are
collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.  

  On
July 2, 2012, Duke Energy merged with Progress Energy, with Duke Energy
continuing as the surviving corporation. Progress Energy became a subsidiary of
Duke Energy and Progress Energy s regulated utility subsidiaries, Duke Energy
Progress (formerly Carolina Power   Light Company d/b/a Progress Energy
Carolinas, Inc.) and Duke Energy Florida (formerly Florida Power Corporation
d/b/a Progress Energy Florida, Inc.), became indirect subsidiaries of Duke
Energy. Duke Energy s consolidated financial statements include Progress
Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida activity beginning July 2,
2012. The impacts of acquisition accounting from Progress Energy s merger with
Duke Energy were recorded by Duke Energy and were not reflected on the
financial statements of Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy
Florida. See Note 2 for additional information regarding the merger. On July 2,
2012, just prior to the close of the merger, Duke Energy executed a
one-for-three reverse stock split with respect to the issued and outstanding
shares of Duke Energy common stock. All per-share amounts included in this Form
10-K are presented as if the stock split had been effective from the beginning
of the earliest period presented.  

  The
information in these combined notes relates to each of the Duke Energy
Registrants as noted in the Index to the Combined Notes. However, none of the
registrants makes any representation as to information related solely to Duke
Energy or the subsidiaries of Duke Energy other than itself.   

  These
Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany
transactions and balances, the accounts of the Duke Energy Registrants and
subsidiaries where the respective Duke Energy Registrants have control. These
Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the Duke Energy Registrants

  Other within Current Assets includes the
current portion of deferred tax assets, which are disclosed in Note 22. Additionally,
the following are included in Other within Current Assets or Current
Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Duke Energy Registrants at
December 31, 2013 and 2012. The amounts presented exceeded 5 percent of current
assets or 5 percent of current liabilities unless otherwise noted.  

Preferred

for Duke Energy Progress and $101.00 to $104.25 per share for Duke Energy
Florida plus accrued dividends for all series. Duke Energy Progress and Duke
Energy Florida redeemed the shares for $62 million and $34 million,
respectively.   

   Discontinued
Operations   

  For the year ended
December 31, 2013, Duke Energy s and Progress Energy s Income From Discontinued
Operations, net of tax was primarily due to tax benefits related to prior sales
of diversified businesses. For the year ended December 31, 2012, Duke Energy s
and Progress Energy s Income From Discontinued Operations, net of tax was
primarily related to resolution of litigation associated with Progress Energy s
former synthetic fuel operations and reversal of certain environmental
indemnification liabilities for which the indemnification period expired during
2012. See Note 5 for more information regarding the former synthetic fuel operations.  

   Amounts
Attributable to Controlling Interests   

  Income From Discontinued Operations, net of
tax presented on the respective Consolidated Statements of Operations for Duke
Energy and Progress Energy is attributable to controlling interests for all
periods presented. Other comprehensive income presented on Progress Energy s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income are attributable
to controlling interests for all periods presented.   

   Significant
Accounting Policies   

   Use of Estimates   

  In
preparing financial statements that conform to generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) in the U.S., the Duke Energy Registrants must make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Regulatory Accounting   

  The
majority of the Duke Energy Registrants  operations are subject to price
regulation for the sale of electricity and gas by state utility commissions or
FERC. When prices are set on the basis of specific costs of the regulated
operations and an effective franchise is in place such that sufficient gas or
electric services can be sold to recover those costs, the Duke Energy
Registrants apply regulatory accounting. Regulatory accounting changes the timing
of the recognition of costs or revenues relative to a company that does not
apply regulatory accounting. As a result, Regulatory assets and Regulatory liabilities
are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Regulatory assets and liabilities
are amortized consistent with the treatment of the related cost in the
ratemaking process. See Note 4 for further information.  

   Regulated Fuel Costs and Purchased Power    

  The
Duke Energy Registrants utilize cost-tracking mechanisms, commonly referred to
as fuel adjustment clauses. These clauses allow for the recovery of fuel and
fuel-related costs and portions of purchased power costs through surcharges on
customer rates. The difference between the costs incurred and the surcharge revenues
is recorded as an adjustment to Fuel used in electric generation and purchased
power   regulated or Operating Revenues   Regulated electric on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations with an off-setting impact on regulatory
assets or liabilities.  

   Cash and Cash Equivalents   

  All
highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date
of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. At December 31, 2013, $1,086
million of Duke Energy s total cash and cash equivalents is held by entities
domiciled in foreign jurisdictions and is forecasted to be used to fund
international operations and investments.  

   Restricted Cash   

  The
Duke Energy Registrants have restricted cash related primarily to collateral
assets, escrow deposits, and variable interest entities (VIEs). Restricted cash
balances are reflected in Other within Current Assets and in Other within Investments
and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2013 and 2012,
Duke Energy had restricted cash totaling $307 million and $574 million,
respectively.  

   Inventory   

  Inventory
is used for operations and is recorded primarily using the average cost method.
Inventory related to regulated operations is valued at historical cost. Inventory
related to nonregulated operations is valued at the lower of cost or market. Materials
and supplies are recorded as inventory when purchased and subsequently charged
to expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment when installed. Reserves
are established for excess and obsolete inventory. The components of inventory
are presented in the tables below.  

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities    

  The
Duke Energy Registrants classify investments into two categories   trading and
available-for-sale. Both categories are recorded at fair value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on
trading securities are included in earnings. For certain investments of
regulated operations such as the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund (NDTF), realized
and unrealized gains and losses (including any other-than-temporary
impairments) on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a regulatory
asset or liability. Otherwise, unrealized gains and losses are included in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), unless other-than-temporarily impaired.
Other-than-temporary impairments for equity securities and the credit loss
portion of debt securities of nonregulated operations are included in earnings.
Investments in debt and equity securities are classified as either current or
noncurrent based on management s intent and ability to sell these securities,
taking into consideration current market liquidity. See Note 15 for further
information.   

   Goodwill and Intangible Assets   

    Goodwill

Combined Notes To

Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)      

Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy
Ohio perform annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31 each year at
the reporting unit level, which is determined to be an operating segment or one
level below. Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Ohio update these
tests between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
value.   

  In
2012, Progress Energy changed its goodwill impairment testing date from October
31 to August 31 to better align its annual goodwill impairment testing
procedure with those of Duke Energy. The change had no impact on goodwill.
Neither the change in the goodwill impairment testing date nor the merger
resulted in any changes to the Progress Energy reporting units.  

    Intangible
Assets    

  Intangible assets are included in Other in
Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, intangible
assets are amortized using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in
which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed, or on a
straight-line basis if that pattern is not readily determinable. Amortization
of intangibles is reflected in Depreciation and amortization in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intangible assets are subject to
impairment testing and if impaired, the carrying value is accordingly reduced.  

  Emission allowances permit the holder of the
allowance to emit certain gaseous by-products of fossil fuel combustion,
including sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ).
Allowances are issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at zero
cost and may also be bought and sold via third-party transactions. Allowances
allocated to or acquired by the Duke Energy Registrants are held primarily for
consumption. Carrying amounts for emission allowances are based on the cost to
acquire the allowances or, in the case of a business combination, on the fair
value assigned in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired
business.  

  Renewable energy certificates are used to
measure compliance with renewable energy standards and are held primarily for
consumption.   

  See
Note 11 for further information.  

   Long-Lived Asset Impairments    

  The
Duke Energy Registrants evaluate long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, for
impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may
not be recoverable. An impairment exists when a long-lived asset s carrying value
exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use
and eventual disposition of the asset. The estimated cash flows may be based on
alternative expected outcomes that are probability weighted. If the carrying
value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable based on these estimated
future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is written-down
to its then-current estimated fair value and an impairment charge is
recognized.  

  The
Duke Energy Registrants assess fair value of long-lived assets using various methods,
including recent comparable third-party sales, internally developed discounted
cash flow analysis and analysis from outside advisors. Significant changes in
commodity prices, the condition of an asset or management s interest in selling
the asset are generally viewed as triggering events to re-assess cash flows.
See Note 11 for further information.   

   Property, Plant and Equipment    

  Property, plant and equipment are stated at
the lower of depreciated historical cost net of any disallowances or fair value,
if impaired. The Duke Energy Registrants capitalize all construction-related
direct labor and material costs, as well as indirect construction costs such as
general engineering, taxes and financing costs. See  Allowance for Funds Used
During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized  for information on
capitalized financing costs. Costs of renewals and betterments that extend the
useful life of property, plant and equipment are also capitalized. The cost of
repairs, replacements and major maintenance projects, which do not extend the
useful life or increase the expected output of the asset, are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation is generally computed over the estimated useful life of
the asset using the composite straight-line method. Depreciation studies are
conducted periodically to update composite rates and are approved by state utility
commissions and/or the FERC when required. The composite weighted-average
depreciation rates, excluding nuclear fuel, are included in the table that
follows.   

In
general, when the Duke Energy Registrants retire regulated property, plant and
equipment, original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage value, is
charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable a
regulated asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original
expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the
corresponding accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset. If
the asset is still in operation, the net amount is classified as Generation
facilities to be retired, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the asset
is no longer operating, the net amount is classified in Regulatory Assets on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of the asset is based on
historical cost if the Duke Energy Registrants are allowed to recover the
remaining net book value and a return equal to at least the incremental borrowing
rate. If not, an impairment is recognized to the extent the net book value of
the asset exceeds the present value of future revenues discounted at the
incremental borrowing rate.

Combined Notes To

Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)      

When the Duke Energy Registrants sell entire
regulated operating units, or retire or sell nonregulated properties, the
original cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization balances are removed
from Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any gain
or loss is recorded in earnings, unless otherwise required by the applicable
regulatory body.   

  See
Note 10 for further information.   

   Nuclear Fuel    

  Nuclear
fuel is classified as Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Nuclear fuel in the front-end fuel processing phase is considered work
in progress and not amortized until placed in service. Amortization of nuclear
fuel is included within Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power  
regulated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization is
recorded using the units-of-production method.   

   Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
(AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized    

  For
regulated operations, the debt and equity costs of financing the construction
of property, plant and equipment are reflected as AFUDC and capitalized as a
component of the cost of property, plant and equipment. AFUDC equity is
reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as non-cash income in
Other income and expenses, net. AFUDC debt is reported as a non-cash offset to
Interest Expense. After construction is completed, the Duke Energy Registrants
are permitted to recover these costs through their inclusion in rate base and
the corresponding subsequent depreciation or amortization of those regulated
assets.   

  AFUDC
equity, a permanent difference for income taxes, reduces the effective tax rate
when capitalized and increases the effective tax rate when depreciated or
amortized. See Note 22 for additional information.   

  For
nonregulated operations, interest is capitalized during the construction phase with
an offsetting non-cash credit to Interest Expense on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.   

   Asset Retirement Obligations   

  Asset retirement obligations are recognized for
legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and
equipment. Substantially all asset retirement obligations are related to
regulated operations. When recording an asset retirement obligation, the
present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which
it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The
liability is accreted over time. The present value of the liability is added to
the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the
asset.   

  The
present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on
discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash
flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other
factors. These estimates are subject to change. Depreciation expense is
adjusted prospectively for any changes to the carrying amount of the associated
asset. The Duke Energy Registrants receive amounts to fund the cost of the
asset retirement obligation for regulated operations through a combination of
regulated revenues and NDTF. As a result, the net of amounts recovered in
regulated revenues, earnings on the NDTF, accretion expense and depreciation of
the associated asset is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.  

  Obligations
for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke
Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the
nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. Duke Energy Florida assumes Crystal
River Nuclear Station   Unit 3 (Crystal River Unit 3) will be placed into a
safe storage configuration until eventual dismantlement begins in approximately
60 years. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also
assume that spent fuel will be stored on site until such time that it can be
transferred to a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility.   

  See
Note 9 for further information.   

   Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenue    

  Revenues
on sales of electricity and gas are recognized when service is provided.
Unbilled revenues are recognized by applying customer billing rates to the
estimated volumes of energy delivered but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues can
vary significantly from period to period as a result of seasonality, weather,
customer usage patterns and meter reading schedules.   

  Unbilled revenues are included within Receivables
and Restricted receivables of variable interest entities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as shown in the following table.

Additionally, Duke
Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell, on a revolving basis, nearly all of
their retail and wholesale accounts receivable, including receivables for
unbilled revenues, to an affiliate, Cinergy Receivables Company, LLC (CRC) and account
for the transfers of receivables as sales. Accordingly, the receivables sold
are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Duke Energy Ohio and
Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 for further information. These receivables for
unbilled revenues are shown in the table below.   

Derivatives and Hedging   

  Derivative
and non-derivative instruments may be used in connection with commodity price,
interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities, including swaps,
futures, forwards and options. All derivative instruments except those that
qualify for the normal purchase/normal sale (NPNS) exception are recorded on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. Qualifying derivative
instruments may be designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.
Other derivative instruments (undesignated contracts) either have not been
designated or do not qualify as hedges. The effective portion of the change in
the fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI. The effective portion
of the change in the fair value of a fair value hedge is offset in net income
by changes in the hedged item. For activity subject to regulatory accounting,
gains and losses on derivative contracts are reflected as regulatory assets or
liabilities and not as other comprehensive income or current period income. As
a result, changes in fair value of these derivatives have no immediate earnings
impact.   

  Formal
documentation, including transaction type and risk management strategy, is
maintained for all contracts accounted for as a hedge. At inception and at
least every three months thereafter, the hedge contract is assessed to see if
it is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of
hedged items.   

  See
Note 14 for further information.   

   Captive Insurance Reserves    

  Duke
Energy has captive insurance subsidiaries that provide coverage, on an
indemnity basis, to the Subsidiary Registrants as well as certain third
parties, on a limited basis, for various business risks and losses, such as property,
workers  compensation and general liability. Liabilities include provisions for
estimated losses incurred but not yet reported (IBNR), as well as estimated provisions
for known claims. IBNR reserve estimates are primarily based upon historical
loss experience, industry data and other actuarial assumptions. Reserve
estimates are adjusted in future periods as actual losses differ from
experience.   

  Duke
Energy, through its captive insurance entities, also has reinsurance coverage
with third parties for certain losses above a per occurrence and/or aggregate
retention. Receivables for reinsurance coverage are recognized when realization
is deemed probable.   

   Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount and
Expense    

  Premiums,
discounts and expenses incurred with the issuance of outstanding long-term debt
are amortized over the term of the debt issue. Call premiums and unamortized
expenses associated with refinancing higher-cost debt obligations used to
finance regulated assets are amortized. Amortization expense is recorded as Interest
Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and is reflected as
Depreciation, amortization and accretion within Net cash provided by operating
activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   

   Loss Contingencies and Environmental
Liabilities    

  Contingent
losses are recorded when it is probable a loss has occurred and can be
reasonably estimated. When a range of the probable loss exists and no amount
within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount
in the range is recorded. Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are
expensed as incurred.   

  Environmental
liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental
remediation or other liabilities becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Environmental expenditures related to past operations that do not generate
current or future revenues are

expensed. Environmental
expenditures related to operations that generate current or future revenues are
expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Certain environmental expenditures
receive regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded as regulatory assets.   

  See
Notes 4 and 5 for further information.   

   Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit
Plans    

  Duke
Energy maintains qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit
plans. Eligible employees of the Subsidiary Registrants participate in the
respective qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans and
are allocated their proportionate share of benefit costs. See Note 21 for further
information, including significant accounting policies associated with these
plans.   

   Severance and Special Termination Benefits    

  Duke
Energy has an ongoing severance plan under which, in general, the longer a
terminated employee worked prior to termination the greater the amount of
severance benefits. A liability for involuntary severance is recorded once an
involuntary severance plan is committed to by management, or sooner, if
involuntary severances are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For
involuntary severance benefits incremental to its ongoing severance plan
benefits, the fair value of the obligation is expensed at the communication
date if there are no future service requirements, or over the required future
service period. From time to time, Duke Energy offers special termination
benefits under voluntary severance programs. Special termination benefits are
recorded immediately upon employee acceptance absent a significant retention
period. Otherwise, the cost is recorded over the remaining service period.
Employee acceptance of voluntary severance benefits is determined by management
based on the facts and circumstances of the benefits being offered. See Note 19
for further information.   

   Guarantees    

  Liabilities
are recognized at the time of issuance or material modification of a guarantee for
the estimated fair value of the obligation it assumes. Fair value is estimated
using a probability-weighted approach. The obligation is reduced over the term
of the guarantee or related contract in a systematic and rational method as
risk is reduced. Any additional contingent loss for guarantee contracts subsequent
to the initial recognition of a liability is accounted for and recognized at
the time a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Note 7 for
further information.  

   Stock-Based Compensation    

  Stock-based
compensation represents costs related to stock-based awards granted to
employees. Duke Energy recognizes stock-based compensation based upon the
estimated fair value of awards, net of estimated forfeitures at the date of
issuance. The recognition period for these costs begin at either the applicable
service inception date or grant date and continues throughout the requisite
service period, or for certain share-based awards until the employee becomes
retirement eligible, if earlier. Compensation cost is recognized as expense or
capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment. See Note 20 for
further information.   

   Income Taxes    

  Duke
Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and
other state and foreign jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants
entered into a tax-sharing agreement with Duke Energy and income taxes recorded
represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate
C-Corporations. Deferred income taxes have been provided for temporary
differences between GAAP and tax bases of assets and liabilities because the
differences create taxable or tax-deductible amounts for future periods. Deferred
taxes are not provided on translation gains and losses when earnings of a
foreign operation are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Investment tax
credits (ITC) associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized
as a reduction of income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the
related properties.   

  Positions
taken or expected to be taken on tax returns, including the decision to exclude
certain income or transactions from a return, are recognized in the financial
statements when it is more likely than not the tax position can be sustained
based solely on the technical merits of the position. The largest amount of tax
benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being effectively settled is
recorded. Management considers a tax position effectively settled when:
(i) the taxing authority has completed its examination procedures,
including all appeals and administrative reviews; (ii) the Duke Energy
Registrants do not intend to appeal or litigate the tax position included in
the completed examination; and (iii) it is remote the taxing authority
would examine or re-examine the tax position. The amount of a tax return
position that is not recognized in the financial statements is disclosed as an
unrecognized tax benefit. These unrecognized tax benefits may impact the
financial statements through increasing income taxes payable, reducing income
tax refunds receivable or changing deferred taxes.  

  Tax-related
interest and penalties are recorded in Interest Expense and Other Income and Expenses,
net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

  See
Note 22 for further information.   

   Accounting for Renewable Energy Tax Credits
and Grants    

  When
Duke Energy elects either an ITC or a cash grant on wind or solar facilities,
it reduces the basis of the property recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets by the amount of the ITC or cash grant and, therefore, the ITC or grant
benefit is recognized through reduced depreciation expense. Additionally,
certain tax credits and government grants received provide for initial tax
depreciable base in excess of the book carrying value equal to one half of the
ITC or government grant. Deferred tax benefits are recorded as a reduction to
income tax expense in the period that the basis difference is created.

Excise Taxes    

  Certain excise taxes levied by state or local
governments are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer.
These taxes are recognized on a gross basis. Otherwise, the taxes are accounted
for net. Excise taxes accounted for on a gross basis as Property and other
taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were as follows.   

Foreign
Currency Translation    

  The local currencies
of most of Duke Energy s foreign operations have been determined to be their functional
currencies. However, certain foreign operations  functional currency has been
determined to be the U.S. Dollar, based on an assessment of the economic
circumstances of the foreign operation   .     Assets and liabilities of foreign
operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar, are
translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end.
Translation adjustments resulting from changes in exchange rates are included in
AOCI. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates
during the year. Gains and losses arising from balances and transactions
denominated in currencies other than the local currency are included in the
results of operations when they occur.   

   Dividend
Restrictions and Unappropriated Retained Earnings    

  Duke Energy does not
have any legal, regulatory or other restrictions on paying common stock
dividends to shareholders. However, as further described in Note 4, due to
conditions established by regulators in conjunction with merger transaction
approvals, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio and
Duke Energy Indiana have restrictions on paying dividends or otherwise
advancing funds to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, an
insignificant amount of Duke Energy s consolidated Retained earnings balance
represents undistributed earnings of equity method investments.   

   New Accounting
Standards    

  The
new accounting standards that were adopted for 2013, 2012 and 2011 had no
significant impact on the presentation or results of operations, cash flows or
financial position of the Duke Energy Registrants. Disclosures have been
enhanced to provide a discussion and tables on derivative contracts subject to
enforceable master netting agreements and a table of quantitative disclosures
about unobservable inputs. See Notes 14 and 16 for further information.  

  There
are no Accounting Standards Updates that have been issued but not yet adopted
as of December 31, 2013, that are expected to significantly impact the
presentation or results of operations, cash flows or financial position or
disclosures of the Duke Energy Registrants  .   

2. ACQUISITIONS,
DISPOSITIONS AND SALES OF OTHER ASSETS   

ACQUISITIONS   

  The
Duke Energy Registrants consolidate assets and liabilities from acquisitions as
of the purchase date, and include earnings from acquisitions in consolidated
earnings after the purchase date.   

   Merger with Progress
Energy   

  On July 2, 2012, Duke Energy completed its
merger with Progress Energy, a North Carolina corporation engaged in the
regulated utility business of generation, transmission and distribution and
sale of electricity in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida.
As a result of the merger, Progress Energy became a wholly owned subsidiary of
Duke Energy  .   

  The merger between Duke Energy and Progress
Energy provides increased scale and diversity with potentially enhanced access
to capital over the long term and a greater ability to undertake the
significant construction programs necessary to respond to increasing
environmental regulation, plant retirements and customer demand growth. Duke
Energy s business risk profile is expected to improve over time due to the
increased proportion of the business that is regulated. Additionally, cost
savings, efficiencies and other benefits are expected from the combined
operations.

Combined Notes To

Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)      

Total consideration transferred was based on
the closing price of Duke Energy common shares on July 2, 2012, and was
calculated as shown in the following table  .   

Progress Energy s stock-based compensation
awards, including performance shares and restricted stock, were replaced with
Duke Energy awards upon consummation of the merger. In accordance with
accounting guidance for business combinations, a portion of the fair value of
these awards is included in the purchase price as it represents consideration
transferred in the merger.  

    Purchase
Price Allocation    

  Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed was determined based on significant estimates and assumptions,
including Level 3 inputs, which are judgmental in nature. Estimates and
assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows,
discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future cash flows, and future market
prices.   

  Additionally the
February 5, 2013 announcement of the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3
reflects additional information related to facts and circumstances existing as
of the acquisition date. See Note 4 for additional information related to
Crystal River Unit 3. As such, Duke Energy presents assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as if the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3 occurred on
the acquisition date.  

  The majority of
Progress Energy s operations are subject to the rate-setting authority of the
FERC, NCUC, PSCSC, and FPSC and are accounted for pursuant to U.S. GAAP,
including the accounting guidance for regulated operations. Rate-setting and
cost recovery provisions currently in place for Progress Energy s regulated
operations provide revenues derived from costs, including a return on
investment of assets and liabilities included in rate base. Except for
long-term debt, asset retirement obligations, capital leases, pension and other
post-retirement benefits (OPEB) plans, and the wholesale portion of Crystal
River Unit 3, fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities
subject to these rate-setting provisions approximate their carrying values.
Accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pro forma financial
information do not reflect any net adjustments related to these amounts. The
difference between fair value and pre-merger carrying amounts for long-term
debt, asset retirement obligations, capital leases and pension and   OPEB plans for
regulated operations were recorded as Regulatory assets.   

  The excess of purchase
price over estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was
recognized as goodwill at the acquisition date. The goodwill reflects the value
paid primarily for long-term potential for enhanced access to capital as a
result of increased scale and diversity, opportunities for synergies, and an
improved risk profile. Goodwill resulting from the merger was allocated
entirely to the Regulated Utilities segment. None of the goodwill recognized is
deductible for income tax purposes, and as such, no deferred taxes have been
recorded related to goodwill.  

  The completed purchase price allocation is
presented in the following table.   

The
purchase price allocation in the table above reflects refinements made to
preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of
December 31, 2012. These refinements include adjustments associated with the
retirement of Crystal River Unit 3. The changes resulted in an increase to
Goodwill of $2 million, an increase to the fair value of Current liabilities,
including current maturities of long-term debt of $12 million, a decrease to
Property, plant and equipment of $138 million, a decrease to Other long-term
assets of $4 million and a decrease to Long-term liabilities, preferred stock
and noncontrolling interests of $152 million. These refinements had no impact
on the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments recorded to earnings
during the year ended December 31, 2013, or for the six months ended December
31, 2012.  

    Pro Forma
Financial Information    

  The following unaudited pro forma
financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Duke
Energy and the amortization of purchase price adjustments assuming the merger
had taken place on January 1, 2011. The unaudited pro forma financial
information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that would have
been achieved or future consolidated results of operations of Duke Energy.

Non-recurring
merger consummation, integration and other costs incurred by Duke Energy and
Progress Energy during the period have been excluded from pro forma earnings presented
below. After-tax non-recurring merger consummation, integration and other costs
incurred by both Duke Energy and Progress Energy were $413 million and $85
million for the years ended 2012 and 2011, respectively. The pro forma
financial information also excludes potential future cost savings or
non-recurring charges related to the merger.   

Accounting Charges
Related to the Merger Consummation    

  The following pretax consummation
charges were recognized upon closing of the merger and are included in the Duke
Energy Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income for the year ended December 31, 2012.  

FERC
Mitigation charges reflect the portion of transmission project costs probable
of disallowance, impairment of the carrying value of the generation assets
serving Interim FERC Mitigation, and mark-to-market losses recognized on power
sale agreements upon closing of the merger. Charges related to transmission
projects and impairment of the carrying value of generation assets were
recorded within Impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Mark-to-market losses on interim power sale agreements was recorded
in Regulated electric operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Subsequent changes in fair value of interim power sale agreements
over the life of the contracts and realized gains or losses on interim contract
sales are also recorded within Regulated electric operating revenues. The
ability to successfully defend future recovery of a portion of transmission
projects in rates and any future changes to estimated transmission project
costs could impact the amount not expected to be recovered.  

  In
conjunction with the merger, in November 2011, Duke Energy and Progress Energy
each offered a voluntary severance plan (VSP) to certain eligible employees.
VSP and other severance costs incurred were recorded primarily within
Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
See Note 19 for further information related to employee severance expenses.   

  Community support,
charitable contributions and other reflect (i) the unconditional obligation to
provide funding at a level comparable to historic practices over the next four
years, and (ii) financial and legal advisory costs incurred upon the closing of
the merger, retention and relocation costs paid to certain employees. These
charges were recorded within Operation, maintenance and other in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

    Impact of Merger     

  The impact of Progress
Energy on Duke Energy s revenues and net income attributable to Duke Energy in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2012
was an increase of $4,943 million and $368 million, respectively.   

   Chilean
Operations   

  In December
2012, Duke Energy acquired Iberoamericana de Energ a   Ibener  , S.A.
(Ibener) of Santiago, Chile for cash consideration of $415 million. This
acquisition included the 140 Megawatt (MW) Duqueco hydroelectric generation
complex consisting of two run-of-the-river plants located in southern Chile. Purchase
price allocation consisted primarily of $383 million of property, plant and
equipment, $30 million of intangible assets, $57 million of deferred income tax
liabilities, $54 million of goodwill and $8 million of working capital  .   In
connection with the acquisition, a $190 million six-month bridge loan and a
$200 million revolving loan under a credit agreement were executed with a
commercial bank. Both loans were fully collateralized with cash deposits, and
therefore no net proceeds from the financings existed as of December 31, 2012. The
$190 million bridge loan was classified in Current maturities of long-term debt
and the related cash collateral deposit was classified as Current Assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012. The revolving loan is
classified as Long-term Debt and the related cash collateral deposit is
classified as Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

  In April
2013, the   six-month
bridge loan executed in connection with the acquisition was replaced with a
nonrecourse secured credit facility with a term of thirteen years, and the cash
collateral related to the six-month bridge loan was returned to Duke Energy.
See Note 6 for additional discussion related to the bridge loan conversion.

Midwest Generation Exit   

  On February
17, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio announced that it had initiated a process to exit
its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing period of
several months and potential regulatory approvals, Duke Energy Ohio expects to
dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to mid-2015.
In the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio will reclassify approximately $3.5
billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to assets held for
sale and expects to record an estimated pretax  impairment charge of $1
billion to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated sales proceeds
less cost to sell.  

   Vermillion Generating
Station   

  On January 12, 2012, after receiving
approvals from the FERC and IURC on August 12, 2011 and December 28, 2011,
respectively, Duke Energy Vermillion II, LLC (Duke Energy Vermillion), an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, completed the sale of its
ownership interest in Vermillion Generating Station (Vermillion) to Duke Energy
Indiana and Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA). Upon closing of the sale,
Duke Energy Indiana held a 62.5 percent interest in Vermillion. Duke Energy
Ohio received net proceeds of $82 million, of which $68 million was paid by
Duke Energy Indiana. Following the transaction, Duke Energy Indiana retired
Gallagher Units 1 and 3 effective February 1, 2012.   

  As Duke Energy Indiana is an affiliate of
Duke Energy Vermillion, the transaction was accounted for as a transfer between
entities under common control with no gain or loss recorded and did not have a
significant impact to Duke Energy Ohio s or Duke Energy Indiana s results of
operations. Proceeds received from Duke Energy Indiana are included in Net proceeds
from the sales of other assets on Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows. Cash paid to Duke Energy Ohio is included in Capital expenditures
on Duke Energy Indiana s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Duke Energy
Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana recognized non-cash equity transfers of $28
million and $26 million, respectively, in their Consolidated Statements of
Common Stockholder s Equity on the transaction representing the difference
between cash exchanged and the net book value of Vermillion. These amounts are
not reflected in Duke Energy s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows or
Consolidated Statements of Equity as the transaction is eliminated in
consolidation.   

  Proceeds from WVPA are included in Net
proceeds from the sales of other assets, and sale of and collections on notes
receivable on Duke Energy s and Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows. The sale of the proportionate share of Vermillion to WVPA did not
result in a significant gain or loss upon close of the transaction.  

   Wind Projects Joint
Venture   

  In April 2012, Duke Energy executed a joint
venture agreement with Sumitomo Corporation of America (SCOA). Under terms of
the agreement, Duke Energy and SCOA each own a 50 percent interest in the joint
venture (DS Cornerstone, LLC), which owns two wind generation projects. Duke
Energy and SCOA also negotiated a $330 million, Construction and 12-year
amortizing Term Loan Facility, on behalf of the borrower, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the joint venture. The loan agreement is non-recourse to Duke
Energy. Duke Energy received proceeds of $319 million upon execution of the
loan agreement. This amount represents reimbursement of a significant portion
of Duke Energy s construction costs incurred as of the date of the agreement. DS
Cornerstone, LLC was initially consolidated with the sale to SCOA because of a
guarantee provided by an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. With
the expiration of the guarantee in 2012, DS Cornerstone, LLC was
deconsolidated.  

   Sales Of Other Assets   

  During 2012, Duke
Energy received proceeds of $187 million from the sale of non-core business
assets within the Commercial Power segment for which no material gain or loss
was recognized.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS    

Duke Energy evaluates
segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as
income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling
interests. Segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues
and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.   

  Operating segments are
determined based on information used by the chief operating decision maker in
deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance.   

  Products and services
are sold between affiliate companies and reportable segments of Duke Energy at
cost. Segment assets as presented in the tables that follow exclude all
intercompany assets.  

   Duke
Energy   

  Duke Energy has the following reportable
operating segments: Regulated Utilities, International Energy and Commercial
Power.   

  Regulated   Utilities conducts
operations primarily through Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke
Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana, and the regulated
transmission and distribution operations of Duke Energy Ohio. These electric
and gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, NCUC,
PSCSC, FPSC, PUCO, IURC, and KPSC. Substantially all of Regulated Utilities 
operations are regulated and, accordingly, these operations qualify for
regulatory accounting treatment.  

  International Energy
principally operates and manages power generation facilities and engages in
sales and marketing of electric power, natural gas, and natural gas liquids
outside the U.S. Its activities principally target power generation in Latin
America. Additionally, International Energy owns   a 25 percent interest in National
Methanol Company (NMC), a large regional producer of Methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE) located in Saudi Arabia. The investment in NMC is accounted for
under the equity method of accounting.

Descriptions of regulatory assets and
liabilities, summarized in the tables above, as well as their recovery and
amortization periods follow. Items are excluded from rate base unless otherwise
noted.  

    Accrued pension and OPEB.     Accrued pension and OPEB
represent regulatory assets and liabilities related to each of the Duke Energy
Registrants  respective shares of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses,
unrecognized prior service cost, and unrecognized transition obligation
attributable to Duke Energy s pension plans and OPEB plans. The regulatory
asset or liability is amortized with the recognition of actuarial gains and
losses, prior service cost, and transition obligations to net periodic benefit
costs for pension and OPEB plans. See Note 21 for additional detail.   

    Retired
generation facilities.     Duke Energy Florida earns a reduced return on a
substantial portion of the amount of regulatory asset associated with the
retirement of Crystal River Unit 3 not included in rate base and a full return
on a portion of the retired plant currently recovered in rates. Once included
in base rates the amount will be amortized over 20 years. Duke Energy Carolinas
and Duke Energy Progress earn a return on the outstanding balance with recovery
periods ranging from five to 10 years. Duke Energy Indiana earns a return on
the outstanding balances and the costs are included in rate base.  

    Asset retirement obligations.     Represents future
removal costs associated with asset retirement obligations for nuclear
facilities. No return is earned on these balances. The recovery period runs
through the decommissioning period of each nuclear unit, the latest of which is
estimated to be 2097. See Note 9 for additional information.  

    Net regulatory asset related to income
taxes.    
Regulatory assets principally associated with the depreciation and recovery of
AFUDC equity. Amounts have no impact on rate base as regulatory assets are offset
by deferred tax liabilities. The recovery period is over the life of the
associated assets.  

    Hedge costs and other deferrals.     Amounts relate to
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives recorded as a regulatory asset or
liability, respectively, until the contracts are settled. The recovery period
varies for these costs, and currently extends to 2027.  

    DSM/EE.     The recovery period
varies for these costs, with some currently unknown. Duke Energy Carolinas,
Duke Energy Progress, and Duke Energy Florida are required to pay interest on
the outstanding liability balance. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida
collect a return on the outstanding asset balance. Duke Energy Carolinas collects
a return on the outstanding balance in South Carolina.  

    Vacation accrual.     Generally recovered within
one year.

Deferred fuel.     Deferred fuel costs
represent certain energy costs that are recoverable or refundable as approved
by the applicable regulatory body. Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, and
Duke Energy Indiana earn a return on under-recovered costs. Duke Energy
Florida, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana pay interest on
over-recovered costs. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress pay
interest on over-recovered costs in North Carolina. Recovery period is
generally over one year. Duke Energy Florida amount includes capacity costs.  

    Nuclear deferral.     Includes (i) amounts related to
levelizing nuclear plant outage costs at Duke Energy Carolinas in North
Carolina and South Carolina, and Duke Energy Progress in North Carolina, which
allows for the recognition of nuclear outage expenses over the refueling cycle
rather than when the outage occurs, resulting in the deferral of operations and
maintenance costs associated with refueling and (ii) certain deferred
preconstruction and carrying costs at Duke Energy Florida as approved by the
FPSC associated with Levy, expected to be recovered in revenues by the end of
2017.  

    Post-in-service carrying costs and
deferred operating expenses.     Represents deferred depreciation and
operating expenses as well as carrying costs on the portion of capital
expenditures placed in service but not yet reflected in retail rates as plant
in service. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio and
Duke Energy Indiana earn a return on the outstanding balance. Duke Energy Ohio
amounts are included in rate base. For Duke Energy Indiana, some amounts are
included in rate base. Recovery is over various lives, and the latest recovery
period is 2067.  

    Gasification services agreement buyout.       The IURC authorized Duke Energy Indiana to recover costs
incurred to buyout a gasification services agreement, including carrying costs
through 2018.  

    Transmission expansion obligation.     Represents transmission
expansion obligations related to Duke Energy Ohio s withdrawal from
Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO).   

    MGP.     Represents

on these costs. See Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional
information.   

    Debt fair value adjustment.     Purchase accounting
adjustment to restate the carrying value of Progress Energy debt to fair value.
Amount is amortized over the life of the related debt.  

    Costs of removal.     Represents funds
received from customers to cover the future removal of property, plant and
equipment from retired or abandoned sites as property is retired. Also includes
unrealized gains on NDTF investments.  

    Amounts to be refunded to customers.     Represents required
refunds to retail customers by the applicable regulatory body. The refund
period is through 2016 for Duke Energy Florida and through 2017 for Duke Energy
Indiana.  

    Storm reserve.     Duke Energy Carolinas
and Duke Energy Florida are allowed to petition the PSCSC and FPSC,
respectively, to seek recovery of named storms. Funds are used to offset future
incurred costs.  

   Restrictions on the
Ability of Certain Subsidiaries to Make Dividends, Advances and Loans to Duke
Energy    

  As
a condition to the approval of merger transactions, the NCUC, PSCSC, PUCO,
KPSC, and IURC imposed conditions on the ability of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke
Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana
to transfer funds to Duke Energy through loans or advances, as well as
restricted amounts available to pay dividends to Duke Energy. Certain
subsidiaries may transfer funds to the parent by obtaining approval of the
respective state regulatory commissions. These conditions imposed restrictions
on the ability of the public utility subsidiaries to pay cash dividends as
discussed below.   

  Duke
Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their
first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation which, in certain
circumstances, limited their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on
common stock. Amounts restricted as a result of these provisions were not
material at December 31, 2013.  

  Additionally, certain other subsidiaries of
Duke Energy have restrictions on their ability to dividend, loan or advance
funds to Duke Energy due to specific legal or regulatory restrictions,
including, but not limited to, minimum working capital and tangible net worth
requirements.  

   Duke Energy Carolinas   

  Duke
Energy Carolinas must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to mergers to
(i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of the
mergers, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded.   

   Duke Energy Progress   

  Duke
Energy Progress must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to the merger
between Duke Energy and Progress Energy to (i) the amount of retained
earnings on the day prior to the closing of the merger, plus (ii) any
future earnings recorded.   

   Duke Energy Ohio   

  Duke
Energy Ohio will not declare and pay dividends out of capital or unearned
surplus without the prior authorization of the PUCO. Duke Energy Ohio received
FERC and PUCO approval to pay dividends from its equity accounts that are
reflective of the amount that it would have in its retained earnings account
had push-down accounting for the Cinergy Corp. (Cinergy) merger not been
applied to Duke Energy Ohio s balance sheet. The conditions include a
commitment from Duke Energy Ohio that equity, adjusted to remove the impacts of
push-down accounting, will not fall below 30 percent of total capital.   

  Duke
Energy Kentucky is required to pay dividends solely out of retained earnings
and to maintain a minimum of 35 percent equity in its capital structure.

   Duke Energy Carolinas   

    2013 North
Carolina Rate Case    

  On September 24, 2013,
the NCUC approved a settlement agreement related to Duke Energy Carolinas 
request for a rate increase with minor modifications. The North Carolina
Utilities Commission Public Staff (Public Staff) was a party to the settlement
agreement. The parties agreed to a three-year step-in rate increase, with the
first two years providing for $204 million, or a 4.5 percent average increase
in rates, and the third year providing for rates to be increased by an
additional $30 million, or 0.6 percent. The agreement is based upon a return on
equity of 10.2 percent and an equity component of the capital structure of 53
percent. The settlement agreement (i) allows for the recognition of nuclear
outage expenses over the refueling cycle rather than when the outage occurs,
(ii) a $10 million shareholder contribution to agencies that provide energy
assistance to low-income customers, and (iii) an annual reduction in the
regulatory liability for costs of removal of $30 million for each of the first
two years. Duke Energy Carolinas also agreed not to request additional base
rate increases to be effective before September 2015. New rates went into
effect on September 25, 2013.   

  On October 23, 2013,
the North Carolina Attorney General (NCAG) appealed the rate of return and
capital structure approved in the agreement. On October 24, 2013, the NC Waste
Awareness and Reduction Network (NC WARN) also appealed various matters in the
settlement. On December 11, 2013, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy
Progress, along with the Public Staff, filed a Motion to Consolidate this
appeal with other North Carolina rate case appeals involving Duke Energy
Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. Both the NCAG and NC WARN filed responses
with the North Carolina Supreme Court (NCSC) contesting consolidation. All
parties are awaiting a ruling from the NCSC. Duke Energy Carolinas cannot
predict the outcome of this matter.  

    2013 South
Carolina Rate Case    

  On September 11, 2013,
the PSCSC approved a settlement agreement related to Duke Energy Carolinas 
request for a rate increase. Parties to the settlement agreement were the
Office of Regulatory Staff, Wal-Mart Stores East, LP and Sam s East,
Incorporated, the South Carolina Energy Users Committee, Public Works of the
City of Spartanburg, South Carolina and the South Carolina Small Business
Chamber of Commerce. The parties agreed to a two-year step-in rate increase,
with the first year providing for approximately $80 million, or a 5.5 percent average
increase in rates, and the second year providing for rates to be increased by
an additional $38 million, or 2.6 percent. The settlement agreement is based
upon a return on equity of 10.2 percent and a 53 percent equity component of
the capital structure. The settlement agreement (i) allows for the recognition
of nuclear outage expenses over the refueling cycle rather than when the outage
occurs, (ii) approximately $4 million of contributions to agencies that provide
energy assistance to low-income customers and for economic development, and
(iii) a reduction in the regulatory liability for costs of removal of $45
million for the first year. Duke Energy Carolinas also agreed not to request
additional base rate increases to be effective before September 2015. New rates
went into effect on September 18, 2013.  

    2011 North Carolina Rate Case    

  On
January 27, 2012, the NCUC approved a settlement agreement related to Duke
Energy Carolinas  request for a rate increase. The Public Staff was a party to
the settlement. On October 23, 2013, the NCUC reaffirmed the rate of return
approved in the January 27, 2012 settlement agreement, in response to an appeal
by the NCAG. On November 21, 2013, the NCAG appealed the reaffirmed order. On
December 11, 2013, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, along with
the Public Staff, filed a Motion to Consolidate this appeal with other North
Carolina rate case appeals involving Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy
Progress. Both the NCAG and NC WARN filed responses with the NCSC contesting
consolidation. All parties are awaiting a ruling from the NCSC. Duke Energy
Carolinas cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  

    William States Lee III Nuclear Station    

  In December 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas applied
to the NRC for a Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) for two
Westinghouse AP1000 (advanced passive) reactors for the proposed William States
Lee III Nuclear Station (Lee Nuclear Station) at a site in Cherokee County,
South Carolina. Submitting the COL application did not commit Duke Energy
Carolinas to build nuclear units. Through several separate orders, the NCUC and
PSCSC concurred with the prudency of Duke Energy Carolinas incurring certain
project development and pre-construction costs  , although recovery of
costs is not guaranteed. Duke Energy Carolinas has incurred approximately $382
million, including AFUDC through December 31, 2013. This amount is included in
Net property, plant and equipment on Duke Energy Carolinas  Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  

  The Lee COL
application is impacted by the ongoing NRC activity to address its Waste
Confidence rule. The Waste Confidence rule is a generic finding by the NRC that
spent fuel can be managed safely until ultimate disposal. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit) remanded the rule to the
NRC. The NRC determined that no final licenses for new reactors would be issued
until the remand is appropriately addressed. Based upon current timelines from
the NRC, licenses would not be issued until November 2014 at the

earliest. The COL is also impacted by the time required
to fully respond to an NRC request for additional information addressing
seismic hazard evaluation resulting from recommendations of the Fukushima
Near-Term Task Force.   

   Duke Energy Progress   

    2012 North
Carolina Rate Case    

  On May 30, 2013, the
NCUC approved a settlement agreement related to Duke Energy Progress  request
for a rate increase. The Public Staff was a party to the settlement agreement.
The parties agreed to a two-year step-in rate increase, with the first year
providing for a $147 million, or a 4.5 percent average increase in rates, and the
second year providing for rates to be increased by an additional $31 million,
or a 1.0 percent average increase in rates. The agreement is based upon a
return on equity of 10.2 percent and an equity component of the capital
structure of 53 percent. The settlement agreement (i) allows for the
recognition of nuclear outage expenses over the refueling cycle rather than
when the outage occurs, (ii) a $20 million shareholder contribution to agencies
that provide energy assistance to low-income customers, and (iii) a reduction
in the regulatory liability for costs of removal of $20 million for the first
year. New rates went into effect on June 1, 2013.  

  On
July 1, 2013, the NCAG appealed the NCUC s approval of the rate of return and
capital structure included in the agreement. NC WARN also appealed various
matters in the settlement. On December 11, 2013, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke
Energy Progress, along with the Public Staff, filed a Motion to Consolidate
this appeal with other North Carolina rate case appeals involving Duke Energy
Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. Both the NCAG and NC WARN filed responses
with the NCSC contesting consolidation. All parties are awaiting a ruling from
the NCSC. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  

    L.V.
Sutton Combined Cycle Facility    

  Duke Energy Progress completed
construction of a 625 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired generating facility
at its existing Sutton Steam Station in New Hanover County, North Carolina. Sutton
began commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

    Harris
Expansion    

  On February 19, 2008, Duke
Energy Progress applied to the NRC for a COL for two Westinghouse Electric
AP1000 reactors at Harris. On May 2, 2013, Duke Energy Progress requested the
NRC to suspend its review activities associated with the COL. As a result of
the decision to suspend the COL applications, Duke Energy Progress recorded a
pretax impairment charge of $22 million during the second quarter of 2013. This
charge represents costs associated with the COL, which are not probable of
recovery. On September 16, 2013 and January 30, 2014, respectively, the NCUC and
PSCSC approved the deferral of the respective retail portion of the COL costs. Approximately
$47 million is recorded in Regulatory assets on Duke Energy Progress 
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013.  

    Wholesale
Depreciation Rates    

  On
April 19, 2013, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with FERC for
acceptance of changes to generation depreciation rates and in August filed for
acceptance of additional changes. These changes will affect the rates of Duke Energy
Progress wholesale power customers that purchase or will purchase power under
formula rates. Certain Duke Energy Progress wholesale customers filed
interventions and protests. FERC accepted the depreciation rate changes, subject
to refund, and set the matter for settlement and hearing in a consolidated
proceeding. FERC further initiated an action with respect to the justness and
reasonableness of the proposed rate changes. Duke Energy Progress cannot
predict the outcome of this matter.  

   Duke Energy Florida   

    FPSC Settlement Agreements    

  On
February 22, 2012, the FPSC approved a settlement agreement (the 2012
Settlement) among Duke Energy Florida, the Florida Office of Public Counsel (OPC)
and other customer advocates. The 2012 Settlement was to continue through the
last billing cycle of December 2016. The agreement addressed four principal
matters: (i) the Crystal River Unit 3 delamination prudence review then pending
before the FPSC, (ii) certain customer rate matters, (iii) Duke Energy
Florida s proposed Levy cost recovery, and (iv) cost of removal reserve.   

  On
October 17, 2013, the FPSC approved a settlement agreement (the 2013
Settlement) between Duke Energy Florida, OPC, and other customer advocates. The
2013 Settlement replaces and supplants the 2012 Settlement and substantially resolves
additional issues, including (i) matters related to Crystal River Unit 3, (ii)
Levy, (iii) Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units, and (iv) future generation needs
in Florida.   

  Refer
to the remaining sections below for further discussion of these settlement
agreements.  

    Crystal River Unit 3    

  In September 2009, Crystal River Unit 3 began
an outage for normal refueling and maintenance as well as an uprate project to
increase its generating capability and to replace two steam generators. During
preparations to replace the steam generators, workers discovered a
delamination, or separation, within the concrete at the periphery of the
containment building, which resulted in an extension of the outage. The
concrete delamination was caused by redistribution of stresses in the
containment wall that occurred when an opening was created to accommodate the
replacement of the unit s steam generators. In March 2011, work to return the
plant to service was suspended after monitoring equipment identified a new
delamination. The second delamination occurred in a different section of the
outer wall after repair work was completed and during the late stages of
retensioning the containment building. Crystal River Unit 3 remained out of
service while Duke Energy Florida conducted an engineering analysis and review of
the second delamination and evaluated possible repair options.   

  Subsequent to March 2011, monitoring
equipment detected additional changes and further damage in the partially
tensioned containment building. Duke Energy Florida developed a repair plan,
which had a preliminary cost estimate of $900 million to $1.3 billion.

On
February 5, 2013, following the completion of a comprehensive analysis and an
independent review by Zapata Incorporated, which estimated repair costs to be
between $1.49 billion and $3.43 billion depending on the repair scope selected,
Duke Energy Florida announced its intention to retire Crystal River Unit 3.
Duke Energy Florida concluded it did not have a high degree of confidence the
repair could be successfully completed and licensed within estimated costs and
schedule, and that it was in the best interests of Duke Energy Florida s
customers and joint owners, and Duke Energy s investors to retire the unit. On
February 20, 2013, Duke Energy Florida filed with the NRC a certification of
permanent cessation of power operations and permanent removal of fuel from the
reactor vessel. In December 2013, Duke Energy Florida filed an updated
site-specific decommissioning study and plan with the NRC and FPSC. The study
resulted in a decommissioning cost estimate of $1,180 million, including
amounts applicable to joint owners, under the safe storage (SAFSTOR) option. Duke
Energy Florida s decommissioning study assumes Crystal River Unit 3 will be in SAFSTOR
configuration, requiring limited staffing to monitor plant conditions, until
the eventual dismantling and decontamination activities occur in 60 years.   This
decommissioning approach is currently utilized at a number of retired domestic
nuclear power plants and is one of three generally accepted approaches to
decommissioning approved by the NRC.  

  Duke Energy Florida
maintains insurance coverage through   Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited s   (NEIL) accidental
property damage program on an actual cash value basis. The NEIL coverage generally
does not include property damage to or resulting from the containment structure.
However, coverage does apply to decontamination and debris removal if required
following an accident to ensure public health and safety or if property damage
results from a terrorism event.  

  Duke Energy
Florida worked with NEIL for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated
replacement power costs throughout the duration of the Crystal River Unit 3
outage. On April 25, 2013, NEIL paid Duke Energy Florida $530 million related
to the Crystal River Unit 3 delaminations. Duke Energy Florida has received a
total of $835 million in insurance proceeds from NEIL related to the Crystal
River Unit 3 delaminations. Duke Energy Florida recorded a regulatory liability
of $490 million upon receipt of the April 2013 NEIL settlement proceeds. This
amount is being refunded to retail customers through Duke Energy Florida s fuel
clause. Proceeds received from NEIL and the related refunds to retail customers
are presented in Operating Activities on Duke Energy Florida s Statements of
Cash Flows.  

  The 2013 Settlement
resolves substantially all remaining issues in the FPSC proceeding related to the
review of Duke Energy Florida s decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3, the
mediated resolution of insurance claims with NEIL, and the costs spent to
repair Crystal River Unit 3; the uprate project; and the components of the
regulatory asset to be recovered in rates beginning no later than 2017 via a
separate base rate component.  

  As a result of
retiring the unit,
Duke Energy Florida is required to refund $100 million to retail customers
through its fuel clause in accordance with the 2012 Settlement (retirement
decision refund). Duke
Energy Florida recorded a Regulatory liability in the third quarter of 2012
related to these replacement power obligations.  

  Duke Energy Florida
has reclassified all Crystal River Unit 3 investments, including property,
plant and equipment, nuclear fuel, inventory, and other assets to a regulatory
asset. The 2012 Settlement authorized Duke Energy Florida to defer the retail
portion of all Crystal River Unit 3-related costs incurred subsequent to
retirement including, but not limited to, operations and maintenance and
property tax costs in a regulatory asset. A regulatory liability must also be
established to capture the difference between (i) actual incurred operations
and maintenance and property tax costs in a given year and, (ii) the amount
included in customer rates as established in Duke Energy Florida s most recent
fully litigated base rate proceeding, effective 2010. Beginning in February
2013, the retail portion of operations and maintenance costs, payroll taxes,
property taxes, and depreciation associated with Crystal River Unit 3 were
deferred to a regulatory asset. Duke Energy Florida deferred $134 million of
these costs to Regulatory assets through December 31, 2013. The 2013 Settlement
terminates the regulatory asset and/or liability treatment for operation and
maintenance and property tax expenses incurred after December 31, 2013.  

  Duke Energy Florida
agreed to forego recovery of $295 million of Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory
assets in accordance with the 2013 Settlement. This excludes amounts related to
the uprate project. Duke Energy Florida recorded a $295 million pretax charge
in the second quarter of 2013 for this matter. This amount is included in
Impairment charges on Duke Energy Florida s Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income.  

  Duke Energy Florida is
allowed to accelerate cash recovery of approximately $130 million of the
Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset from retail customers from 2014 through
2016 through its fuel clause. Duke Energy Florida will begin recovery of the
remaining Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset, up to a cap of $1,466 million
from retail customers upon the earlier of (i) full recovery of the uncollected
Levy investment or (ii) the first billing period of January 2017. Recovery will
continue 240 months from inception of collection of the regulatory asset in
base rates. The Crystal River Unit 3 base rate component will be adjusted at
least every four years. Included in this recovery, but not subject to the cap,
are costs of building a dry cask storage facility for spent nuclear fuel. The
return rate will be based on the currently approved AFUDC rate with a return on
equity of 7.35 percent, or 70 percent of the currently approved 10.5 percent.
The return rate is subject to change if the return on equity changes in the
future. Construction of the dry cask storage facility is subject to separate
FPSC approval. The regulatory asset associated with the uprate project will
continue to be recovered through the Nuclear Cost Recovery Clause (NCRC) over
an estimated seven-year period beginning in 2013.   

  Through December 31,
2013, Duke Energy Florida deferred $1,310 million for rate recovery related to
Crystal River Unit 3, which is subject to the rate recovery cap in the 2013 Settlement.
In addition, Duke Energy Florida deferred $323 million for recovery costs
associated with building a dry cask storage facility and the original uprate
project, which is not subject to the rate recovery cap discussed above. Duke
Energy Florida does not expect the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset to
exceed the cap prior to full cash recovery from its retail customers.

retail customer refunds agreed to in the 2012 Settlement and the 2013
Settlement.

base rate increases for the recovery of the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory
asset beginning no later than 2017 and base rate increases for new generation through
2018, per the provisions of the 2013 Settlement. Duke Energy Florida is not required
to file a depreciation study, fossil dismantlement study or nuclear
decommissioning study until the earlier of the next rate case filing or March 31,
2019. The
2012 Settlement provided for a $150 million increase in base revenue effective
with the first billing cycle of January 2013. Costs associated with Crystal
River Unit 3 investments were removed from retail rate base effective with the
first billing cycle of January 2013. Duke Energy Florida is accruing, for
future rate-setting purposes, a carrying charge on the Crystal River Unit 3
investment until the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset is recovered in base
rates. If Duke Energy Florida s retail base rate earnings fall below the return
on equity range, as reported on a FPSC-adjusted or pro-forma basis on a monthly
earnings surveillance report, it may petition the FPSC to amend its base rates
during the term of the 2013 Settlement.   

  Duke Energy Florida is
refunding $288 million to retail customers through its fuel clause, as required
by the 2012 Settlement.  

    Levy    

  On July 28,
2008, Duke Energy Florida applied to the NRC for a COL for two Westinghouse
AP1000 reactors at Levy. Various parties filed a joint petition to intervene in
the Levy COL application. On March 26, 2013, the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board issued a ruling that the NRC had carried its burden of demonstrating its
Final Environmental Impact Statement complies with the National Environmental
Policy Act and applicable NRC regulatory requirements.  

  In 2008,
the FPSC granted Duke Energy Florida s petition for an affirmative
Determination of Need and related orders requesting cost recovery under
Florida s nuclear cost-recovery rule, together with the associated facilities,
including transmission lines and substation facilities.  

  Under the terms of the
2012 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida began retail cost recovery of Levy costs
effective in the first billing cycle of January 2013 at the fixed rates
contained in the settlement and continuing for a five-year period, with true-up
of any actual costs not recovered during the five-year period occurring in the
final year. This amount is intended to recover the estimated retail project
costs to date including costs necessary to obtain the COL and any engineering,
procurement and construction (EPC) agreement cancellation costs. The 2012
Settlement provided that Duke Energy Florida will treat the allocated wholesale
cost of Levy as a retail regulatory asset and include this asset as a component
of rate base and amortization expense for regulatory reporting. The consumer
parties agree to not oppose Duke Energy Florida continuing to pursue a COL for
Levy.  

  On January 28, 2014, Duke Energy Florida
terminated the EPC.   Duke Energy Florida may be required to pay for work performed under
the EPC and to bring existing work to an orderly conclusion, including but not
limited to, costs to demobilize and cancel certain equipment and material
orders placed.   Duke
Energy Florida is allowed to recover reasonable and prudent EPC cancellation
costs from its retail customers. If Duke Energy Florida, at its own discretion,
decides not to pursue the COL prior to March 31, 2015, it agrees to credit
customers $10 million as a reduction to fuel costs.  

  In accordance with the
2013 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida ceased amortization of the wholesale
allocation of Levy investments against retail rates. In the second quarter of
2013, Duke Energy Florida recorded a pretax charge of $65 million to write-off
the wholesale portion of Levy investments. This amount is included in
Impairment charges on the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  

  Recovery of the remaining retail portion of
the project costs will occur over five years from 2013 through 2017. Duke
Energy Florida has an ongoing responsibility to demonstrate prudency related to
the wind down of the Levy investment and the potential for salvage of Levy
assets. As of December 31, 2013, Duke Energy Florida has a net uncollected
investment in Levy of approximately $264 million, including AFUDC. Of this amount, $50
million is included in Regulatory assets, $117 million related to land and the
COL is included in Net, property, plant and equipment, and $97 million is
included in Regulatory assets within Current Assets on the Balance Sheets.  

    Crystal River 1 and 2 Coal Units    

  Duke Energy Florida has evaluated Crystal
River 1 and 2 coal units for retirement in order to comply with certain
environmental regulations. Based on this evaluation, those units will likely be
retired by 2018. Once those units are retired Duke Energy Florida will continue
recovery of existing annual depreciation expense through the end of 2020.
Beginning in 2021, Duke Energy Florida will be allowed to recover any remaining
net book value of the assets from retail customers through the Capacity Cost
Recovery Clause. On December 31, 2013 Duke

Energy
Florida filed a petition with the FPSC to allow for the recovery of prudently
incurred costs to comply with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard through the
Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.   

    New
Generation    

  Duke Energy Florida currently projects a
significant need for additional generation to offset the impact of retirement
of Crystal River Unit 3 as well as the possible retirement of Crystal River 1
and 2 coal units. The 2013 Settlement establishes a recovery mechanism for
additional generation needs. This recovery mechanism, the Generation Base Rate
Adjustment (GBRA), will apply to (i) the construction, uprate of existing
generation, and/or purchase of up to 1,150 MW of combustion turbine and/or
combined cycle generating capacity prior to the end of 2017, and (ii) the
construction of additional generation of up to 1,800 MW to be placed in service
in 2018 upon FPSC approval of a need determination. The GBRA allows recovery of
prudent costs of these items through an increase in base rates, upon the
in-service date of such assets, without a general rate case at a 10.5 percent return on equity. On
October 8, 2013, Duke Energy Florida issued a request for proposals to evaluate
alternatives for an additional generation facility. Duke Energy Florida is
currently reviewing bids received on December 9, 2013.  

    Cost
of Removal Reserve    

  The 2012 Settlement and the 2013
Settlement provide Duke Energy Florida the discretion to reduce cost of removal
amortization expense up to the balance in the cost of removal reserve until the
earlier of its applicable cost of removal reserve reaches zero or the
expiration of the 2013 Settlement. Duke Energy Florida may not reduce
amortization expense if the reduction would cause it to exceed the appropriate
high point of the return on equity range. Duke Energy Florida recognized a
reduction in amortization expense of $114 million, $178 million, and $250 million
for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 respectively. Duke Energy
Florida had no cost of removal reserves eligible for amortization to income remaining
at December 31, 2013.  

   Duke
Energy Ohio   

    Capacity
Rider Filing    

  On August 29, 2012,
Duke Energy Ohio applied to the PUCO for the establishment of a charge for
capacity provided pursuant to its obligations as a Fixed Resource Requirement
(FRR) entity. The charge, which is consistent with Ohio s state compensation
mechanism, is estimated to be approximately $729 million, and reflects Duke
Energy Ohio s embedded cost of capacity. On February 13, 2014, the PUCO denied
Duke Energy Ohio s request.  

    2012 Electric
Rate Case    

  On May 1, 2013, the
PUCO approved a settlement agreement (the Electric Settlement) related to Duke
Energy Ohio s electric distribution rate case. All intervening parties signed
the Electric Settlement. The Electric Settlement provides for a net increase in
electric distribution revenues of $49 million, or an average increase of 2.9
percent, based upon a return on equity of 9.84 percent. Revised rates were
effective in May 2013.   

    2012
Natural Gas Rate Case    

  On April 2, 2013, Duke
Energy Ohio, the PUCO Staff, and intervening parties filed a settlement (the
Gas Settlement) with the PUCO related to a gas distribution case. The Gas
Settlement provides for no increase in base rates for gas distribution service.
The Gas Settlement left unresolved the recovery of environmental remediation
costs associated with former manufactured gas plants (MGP). The Gas Settlement
is based upon a return on equity of 9.84 percent.  

  On November 13, 2013, the
PUCO issued an order approving the Gas Settlement and allowing for the recovery
of $56 million of MGP costs, excluding carrying costs, to be recovered over a
five-year period beginning in 2014. On February 19, 2014, the PUCO denied intervening
consumer groups  motion to stay implementation of its order, or, in the
alternative, to implement the MGP rider subject to refund. Intervening groups
have provided notice of their intent to appeal the PUCO s decision to the Ohio
Supreme Court. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  

    Generation Asset
Transfer    

  On April 2, 2012 and
amended on June 22, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio and various affiliated entities
filed an Application for Authorization for Disposition of Jurisdictional
Facilities with FERC. The application seeks to transfer, from Duke Energy
Ohio s rate-regulated Ohio utility company, the legacy coal-fired and
combustion gas turbine assets to a nonregulated affiliate, consistent with the
ESP stipulation approved by the PUCO on November 22, 2011. The application
outlines a potential additional step in the reorganization that would result in
a transfer of all of Duke Energy Ohio s Commercial Power business to an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. The process of determining the
optimal corporate structure is an ongoing evaluation of factors, such as tax
considerations, that may change between now and the transfer date. In
conjunction with the transfer, Duke Energy Ohio s capital structure will be
restructured to reflect appropriate debt and equity ratios for its regulated operations.
The transfer could instead be accomplished within a wholly owned nonregulated
subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio depending on final tax structuring analysis. The
FERC approved the application on September 5, 2012. Duke Energy Ohio agreed to
transfer the legacy coal-fired and combustion gas turbine assets on or before
December 31, 2014.  

    Regional Transmission Organization (RTO)
Realignment    

  Duke
Energy Ohio including Duke Energy Kentucky, transferred control of its
transmission assets from MISO to   PJM  ,
effective December 31, 2011.   

  On
December 22, 2010, the KPSC approved Duke Energy Kentucky s request to effect
the RTO realignment, subject to a commitment not to seek double-recovery in a
future rate case of the transmission expansion fees that may be charged by MISO
and PJM in the same period or overlapping periods.

Combined Notes To

Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)      

On May 25, 2011, the PUCO approved a
settlement between Duke Energy Ohio, Ohio Energy Group, The Office of Ohio
Consumers  Counsel and the PUCO Staff related to Duke Energy Ohio s recovery of
certain costs of the RTO realignment via a non-bypassable rider. Duke Energy
Ohio is allowed to recover all MISO Transmission Expansion Project (MTEP)
costs, including but not limited to Multi-Value Project (MVP) costs, directly
or indirectly charged to Duke Energy Ohio retail customers. Duke Energy Ohio
will not recover any portion of the MISO exit obligation, PJM integration fees,
or internal costs associated with the RTO realignment, and the first $121
million of PJM transmission expansion costs from Ohio retail customers. Duke
Energy Ohio also agreed to vigorously defend against any charges for MVP
projects from MISO.  

  Upon
its exit from MISO on December 31, 2011, Duke Energy Ohio recorded a liability
for its exit obligation and share of MTEP costs, excluding MVP. This liability
was recorded within Other in Current liabilities and Other in Deferred credits
and other liabilities on Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

  The
following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance
of Duke Energy Ohio s recorded obligations related to its withdrawal from MISO.  

MVP.
    MISO
approved 17 MVP proposals prior to Duke Energy Ohio s exit from MISO on
December 31, 2011. Construction of these projects is expected to continue
through 2020. Costs of these projects, including operating and maintenance
costs, property and income taxes, depreciation and an allowed return, are
allocated and billed to MISO transmission owners.  

  On
December 29, 2011, MISO filed a tariff with the FERC providing for the
allocation of MVP costs to a withdrawing owner based on monthly energy usage.
The FERC set for hearing (i) whether MISO s proposed cost allocation
methodology to transmission owners who withdrew from MISO prior to January 1,
2012 is consistent with the tariff at the time of their withdrawal from MISO,
and, (ii) if not, what amount of, and methodology for calculating any MVP cost
responsibility should be. On July 16, 2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge
(ALJ) issued an initial decision. Under this initial decision, Duke Energy Ohio
would be liable for MVP costs. Duke Energy Ohio filed exceptions to the initial
decision, requesting the FERC overturn the ALJ s decision. After reviewing the
initial decision, along with all exceptions and responses filed by the parties,
the FERC will issue a final decision. Duke Energy Ohio fully intends to appeal
to the federal court of appeals if the FERC affirms the ALJ s decision. Duke
Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.   

  In
2012, MISO estimated Duke Energy Ohio s MVP obligation over the period from
2012 to 2071 at $2.7 billion, on an undiscounted basis. The estimated
obligation is subject to great uncertainty including the ultimate cost of the
projects, the annual costs of O M, taxes and return over the project lives
and the allocation to Duke Energy Ohio.  

   Duke
Energy Indiana   

    Edwardsport
IGCC Plant    

  On November 20, 2007,
the IURC granted Duke Energy Indiana a Certificate of Public Convenience and
Necessity (CPCN) for the construction of a 618 MW IGCC power plant at Duke
Energy Indiana s existing Edwardsport Generating Station in Knox County,
Indiana with a cost estimate of $1.985 billion assuming timely recovery of
financing costs related to the project. On January 25, 2008, Duke Energy
Indiana received the final air permit from the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Inc.,
Sierra Club, Inc., Save the Valley, Inc., and Valley Watch, Inc., all
intervenors in the CPCN proceeding (collectively, the Joint Intervenors),
appealed the air permit. A settlement related to the air permit was reached on
August 30, 2013. The air permit was not impacted by the provisions of the
settlement.   

  Duke Energy Indiana experienced design
modifications, quantity increases and scope growth above what was anticipated
from the preliminary engineering design, which increased capital costs for the
project. As a result, the projected cost estimate increased throughout
construction of the project and various revised estimates were filed with the
IURC. In October 2012, Duke Energy Indiana revised its latest projected cost
estimate to $3.15 billion (excluding AFUDC).  

  On December 27, 2012,
the IURC approved a settlement agreement (2012 Edwardsport settlement) related
to the cost increase for the construction of the project, including subdockets
before the IURC related to the project. The   Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (  OUCC), the
Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel-Indiana were parties to
the settlement. This settlement agreement resolved all then pending regulatory
issues related to the project. The settlement agreement, as approved, capped
costs to be reflected in customer rates at $2.595 billion, including estimated
AFUDC through June 30, 2012. Duke Energy Indiana is allowed to recover AFUDC
after June 30, 2012, until customer rates are revised, with such recovery
decreasing to 85 percent on AFUDC accrued after November 30, 2012.   Duke Energy Indiana
also agreed not to request a retail electric base rate increase prior to March
2013, with rates in effect no earlier than April 1, 2014.  

  The IURC
modified the 2012 Edwardsport settlement as previously agreed to by the parties
to (i) require Duke Energy Indiana to credit customers for cost control
incentive payments the IURC found to be unwarranted as a result of delays that
arose from project cost overruns and (ii) provide that if Duke Energy Indiana
should recover more than the project costs absorbed by Duke Energy s
shareholders through litigation, any surplus must be returned to the Duke
Energy Indiana s ratepayers.   

  Over the
course of construction of the project, Duke Energy Indiana recorded pretax
charges of approximately $897 million related to the Edwardsport project,
including the settlement agreement discussed above.   Of
this amount, pretax impairment and other charges of $631 million were recorded
during the year ended December 31, 2012.   These charges were
recorded in Impairment charges and Operations, maintenance and other on Duke
Energy Indiana s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income.

   Other Regulatory Matters   

   Merger Appeals   

  On January 9, 2013,
the City of Orangeburg and NC WARN appealed the NCUC s approval of the merger
between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. On April 29, 2013, the NCUC granted Duke
Energy s motion to dismiss certain exceptions contained in NC WARN s appeal. On
November 6, 2013, the North Carolina Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on
the appeals. A decision from the North Carolina Court of Appeals is pending.  

   Progress Energy Merger FERC Mitigation   

  In June 2012, the FERC approved the merger
with Progress Energy, including Duke Energy and Progress Energy s revised market
power mitigation plan, the Joint Dispatch Agreement (JDA) and the joint Open
Access Transmission Tariff. The revised market power mitigation plan provides
for the   acceleration
of one transmission project and the   completion of seven other transmission projects
(Long-term FERC Mitigation) and interim firm power sale agreements during the
completion of the transmission projects (Interim FERC Mitigation). The
Long-term FERC Mitigation is expected to increase power imported into the Duke
Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress service areas and enhance competitive
power supply options in the service areas. These projects are expected to be
completed in 2014. On August 8, 2012, FERC granted certain intervenors  request
for rehearing for further consideration.  

  Following the closing of the merger, outside
counsel reviewed Duke Energy s mitigation plan and discovered a technical error
in the calculations.   On December 6, 2013,   Duke Energy   submitted a filing
with the FERC disclosing   the
error and   arguing
that no additional mitigation is necessary. On February 4, 2014, The City of
New Bern, North Carolina filed comments to Duke Energy s filing. Duke Energy s
response to New Bern was filed on February 19, 2014.   Duke Energy cannot
predict the outcome of this matter.  

   Planned and
Potential Coal Plant Retirements   

  The Subsidiary
Registrants periodically file Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) with their state
regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over
a 10-20 year period, and options being considered to meet those needs. The IRPs
filed by the Subsidiary Registrants in 2013, 2012 and 2011 included planning
assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities in
South Carolina, Florida, Indiana and Ohio earlier than their current estimated
useful lives. The facilities do not have the requisite emission control
equipment, primarily to meet EPA regulations that are not yet effective.   

  The table

  the Edwardsport air permit.      

Duke Energy continues to
  evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities
  earlier than the current estimated useful lives, and plans to seek regulatory
  recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any of these
  assets are retired. However, such recovery, including recovery of carrying
  costs on remaining book values, could be subject to future regulatory
  approvals and therefore cannot be assured.       

5. COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES   

General Insurance    

  The
Duke Energy Registrants have insurance and reinsurance coverage either directly
or through indemnification from Duke Energy s captive insurance company, Bison,
and its affiliates, consistent with companies engaged in similar commercial
operations with similar type properties. The Duke Energy Registrants  coverage
includes (i) commercial general liability coverage for liabilities arising to
third parties for bodily injury

and property damage;
(ii) workers  compensation; (iii) automobile liability coverage; and (iv) property
coverage for all real and personal property damage. Real and personal property
damage coverage excludes electric transmission and distribution lines, but
includes damages arising from boiler and machinery breakdowns, earthquakes,
flood damage and extra expense, but not outage or replacement power coverage.
All coverage is subject to certain deductibles or retentions, sublimits, exclusions,
terms and conditions common for companies with similar types of operations.  

  The
Duke Energy Registrants self-insure their electric transmission and
distribution lines against loss due to storm damage and other natural
disasters. As discussed further in Note 4, Duke Energy Florida maintains a
storm damage reserve and has a regulatory mechanism to recover the cost of
named storms on an expedited basis.  

  The
cost of the Duke Energy Registrants  coverage can fluctuate year to year
reflecting claims history and conditions of the insurance and reinsurance
markets.  

  In the event of a
loss, terms and amounts of insurance and reinsurance available might not be
adequate to cover claims and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and
other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a
material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants  results of operations, cash
flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses
may exceed limits of the coverage available.  

   Nuclear Insurance   

  Duke
Energy Carolinas owns and operates the McGuire Nuclear Station (McGuire) and the
Oconee Nuclear Station (Oconee) and operates and has a partial ownership
interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station (Catawba). McGuire and Catawba each have
two reactors. Oconee has three reactors. The other joint owners of Catawba
reimburse Duke Energy Carolinas for certain expenses associated with nuclear
insurance per the Catawba joint owner agreements.  

  Duke
Energy Progress owns and operates the Robinson Nuclear Station (Robinson) and
operates and has a partial ownership interest in the Brunswick Nuclear Station
(Brunswick) and Harris. Robinson and Harris each have one reactor. Brunswick
has two reactors. The other joint owners of Brunswick and Harris reimburse Duke
Energy Progress for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the Brunswick
and Harris joint owner agreements.  

  Duke
Energy Florida manages and has a partial ownership interest in Crystal River Unit
3, which has been retired. The other joint owners of Crystal River Unit 3 reimburse
Duke Energy Florida for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per
the Crystal River Unit 3 joint owner agreement.  

  In
the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance available might not be
adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses
and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a
material effect on Duke Energy Carolinas , Duke Energy Progress  and Duke
Energy Florida s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each
company is responsible to the extent losses may exceed limits of the coverage available.  

   Nuclear
Liability Coverage   

  The
Price-Anderson Act requires owners of nuclear reactors to provide for public
nuclear liability protection per nuclear incident up to a maximum total
financial protection liability. The maximum total financial protection
liability increased to a total of $13.6 billion. This amount is adjusted every
five years for an inflationary provision. Total nuclear liability coverage
consists of a combination of private primary nuclear liability insurance
coverage and a mandatory industry risk-sharing program to provide for excess
nuclear liability coverage above the maximum reasonably available private
primary coverage.       The United States Congress could impose
revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims.  

    Primary Liability
Insurance    

  Duke Energy Carolinas,
Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have purchased the maximum
reasonably available private primary nuclear liability insurance as required by
law, which currently is $375 million per station.  

    Excess Liability
Program    

This program provides $13.2 billion of
coverage per incident through the Price-Anderson Act s mandatory industry-wide
excess secondary financial protection program of risk pooling. This amount is
the product of potential cumulative retrospective premium assessments of $127
million times the current 104 licensed commercial nuclear reactors in U.S.
Under this program, licensees could be assessed retrospective premiums to
compensate for public nuclear liability damages in the event of a nuclear
incident at any licensed facility in the U.S. Retrospective premiums may be
assessed at a rate not to exceed $19 million per year per licensed reactor for
each incident. The assessment may be subject to state premium taxes.  

   Nuclear Property Coverage   

  Duke Energy Carolinas,
Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are members of NEIL, which
provides insurance coverage for nuclear facilities under three policy programs:
the primary property insurance program, the excess property insurance program
and the accidental outage insurance program.  

  Pursuant
to regulations of the NRC, each company s property damage insurance policies
provide that all proceeds from such insurance be applied, first, to place the
plant in a safe and stable condition after a qualifying accident, and second,
to decontaminate the plant before any proceeds can be used for decommissioning,
plant repair or restoration.  

  Losses
resulting from non-certified acts of terrorism are covered as common occurrences,
such that if non-certified terrorist acts occur against one or more commercial
nuclear power plants insured by NEIL within a 12-month period, they would be
treated as one event and the owners

of the plants
where the act occurred would share one full limit of liability. The full limit
of liability is currently $3.2 billion. NEIL sublimits the total aggregate for
all of their policies for non-nuclear terrorist events to approximately $1.83
billion.  

    Primary
Property Insurance    

  This
policy provides $500 million of primary property damage coverage. The
deductible per occurrence is $3 million for Catawba, and $10 million for the
remaining nuclear facilities. This policy also has a 10 percent deductible
provision excess of these deductibles for natural catastrophe damage.  

    Excess
Property Insurance    

  This
policy provides excess property, decontamination and decommissioning liability
insurance of $2.25 billion for Catawba, $750 million each for Oconee, McGuire,
Brunswick, Harris and Robinson; and $560 million for Crystal River Unit 3. All
nuclear facilities except for Catawba and Crystal River Unit 3 also share an
additional $1 billion insurance limit above their dedicated underlying excess.
This shared additional excess limit is not subject to reinstatement in the
event of a loss.  

  Crystal
River Unit 3 s primary and excess property insurance is on an actual cash value
basis. NEIL coverage does not include property damage to or resulting from the
containment structure except coverage does apply to decontamination and debris
removal, if required following an accident, to ensure public health and safety
or if property damage results from a terrorism event.  

  NEIL sublimits
property damage losses to $1.5 billion for non-nuclear accidental property
damage.  

   Accidental
Outage Insurance   

  This
policy     provides replacement power ex  p  ense coverage   r  esulting from an     accidental
prope  rt  y damage out  a  ge      of
a nuclear unit. Coverage amounts decrease in the event more than one unit at a
station is out of service due to a common accident. Initial coverage begins
after a 12-week deductible period. Coverage continues at 100 percent of the
weekly limits for 52 weeks and 80 percent of the weekly limits for the next 110
weeks.  

  The
Catawba units are insured for up to $4 million per week. The McGuire units are
insured for up to $4 million per week. The Oconee units are insured for up to $3
million per week. The   Brunswick   units
are insured for   up to $3 million per week.
The Harris unit is insured for up to $3 million per week. The Robinson unit is
insured for up to $2 million per week.   The accidental outage policy
limit is $490 million for McGuire and Catawba, $378 million for Oconee, $406
million for Brunswick, $364 million for Harris, and $308 million for Robinson.   

  NEIL
sublimits the accidental outage recovery to the first 104 weeks of coverage not
to exceed $328 million from non-nuclear accidental property damage.  

   Potential
Retroactive Premium Assessments   

  In
the event of NEIL losses, NEIL s board of directors may assess member companies
retroactive premiums of amounts up to 10 times their annual premiums for up to
six years after a loss. The current potential maximum assessments for Duke
Energy Carolinas are $42 million for primary property insurance, $36 million
for excess property insurance and $29 million for accidental outage insurance. The
current potential maximum assessments for Duke Energy Progress are $33 million for
primary property insurance, $32 million for excess property insurance and $14
million for accidental outage insurance. The current potential maximum
assessments for Duke Energy Florida are $6 million for primary property insurance
and $4 million for excess property insurance.  

  The maximum assessment
amounts include 100 percent of Duke Energy Carolinas , Duke Energy Progress ,
and Duke Energy Florida s potential obligations to NEIL for their share of
jointly owned reactors. However, the other joint owners of the jointly owned
reactors are obligated to assume their pro rata share of liability for
retrospective premiums and other premium assessments resulting from the
Price-Anderson Act s excess secondary financial protection program of risk
pooling, or from the NEIL policies.  

   ENVIRONMENTAL   

  Duke Energy is subject
to international, federal, state, and local regulations regarding air and water
quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, and other environmental matters. The
Subsidiary Registrants are subject to federal, state, and local regulations
regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other
environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time,
imposing new obligations on the Duke Energy Registrants.  

  The
following environmental matters impact all of the Duke Energy Registrants.  

   Remediation Activities       

  The
Duke Energy Registrants are responsible for environmental remediation at
various contaminated sites. These include some properties that are part of
ongoing operations and sites formerly owned or used by Duke Energy entities. These
sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation, and monitoring.
Managed in conjunction with relevant federal, state, and local agencies,
activities vary with site conditions and locations, remediation requirements,
complexity, and sharing of responsibility. If remediation activities involve
joint and several liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or
contribution actions, the Duke Energy Registrants could potentially be held
responsible for contamination caused by other potentially responsible parties,
and may also benefit from insurance policies or contractual indemnities that cover
some or all cleanup costs. Liabilities are recorded when losses become probable
and are reasonably estimable. The total costs that may be incurred cannot be
estimated because the extent of environmental impact, allocation among
potentially responsible parties, remediation alternatives, and/or regulatory
decisions has not yet been determined. Additional costs associated with
remediation activities are likely to be incurred in the future and could be
significant. Costs are typically expensed as Operation, maintenance and other
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations unless regulatory recovery of the
costs is deemed probable.

Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

Regulations   

    Clean Water Act 316(b)    

  The
EPA proposed a cooling water intake structures rule on April 20, 2011. The
proposed rule advances one main approach and three alternatives. Based on the
main approach proposed, most, if not all of the steam electric generating
facilities the Duke Energy Registrants own are likely affected sources unless
retired prior to implementation of the 316(b) requirements.   

  The
revised deadline for issuance of the final 316(b) rule is April 17, 2014. If
the rule is finalized as proposed, modifications to affected power plant cooling
water intake structures could be required by mid-to-late 2017. The Duke Energy
Registrants are unable to predict the outcome of this rulemaking, but the
impact could be significant.   

    Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)    

  On
August 8, 2011, the final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) was published
in the Federal Register. The CSAPR established state-level annual SO 2 
budgets and annual seasonal NO x  budgets that were to take effect on
January 1, 2012.  

  On
August 21, 2012, the D.C. Circuit Court vacated the CSAPR. The court also
directed the EPA to continue administering the Clean Air Interstate Rule
(CAIR). The CAIR requires additional reductions in SO 2  and NO x 
emissions beginning in 2015. On June 24, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court (Supreme
Court) granted the EPA s petitions for a writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court
is likely to issue its decision on the merits by mid-2014.  

  The
Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings.
Continued compliance with CAIR pending the outcome of the rehearing process
will not result in the Duke Energy Registrants adding new emission controls.   

    Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR)    

  On
June 21, 2010, the EPA proposed a regulation under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act, related to CCR or coal combustion byproducts associated with
the generation of electricity. The EPA proposal contains two regulatory options
whereby CCRs not employed in approved beneficial use applications would either
(i) be regulated as hazardous waste or (ii) continue to be regulated as
non-hazardous waste.  

  On
October 29, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia directed
the EPA to provide the Court, within 60 days of the Order, a proposed schedule
for completing the CCR rulemaking. On January 29, 2014, the EPA filed a consent
decree agreeing to issue the final rule by December 19, 2014. The Duke Energy
Registrants cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking, but the impact could
be significant.  

    Steam Electric
Effluent Limitation Guidelines    

  On
June 7, 2013, the EPA proposed Steam Electric Effluent Limitations Guidelines
(ELGs). The EPA is under a court order to finalize the rule by May 22, 2014.
The EPA has proposed eight options for the rule, which vary in stringency and
cost. The proposed regulation applies to seven waste streams, including
wastewater from air pollution control equipment and ash transport water. Most, if not all of
the steam electric generating facilities the Duke Energy Registrants own are
likely affected sources. Compliance is proposed as soon as possible after July
1, 2017, but may extend until July 1, 2022. The Duke Energy Registrants are
unable to predict the outcome of the rulemaking, but the impact could be
significant.

Greenhouse Gas New
Source Performance Standards (NSPS)    

  On January 8, 2014, the
EPA proposed a rule to establish carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions
standards for new pulverized coal, IGCC, natural gas combined cycle, and simple
cycle electric generating units commencing construction on or after the date
the proposal appears in the Federal Register. Future coal and IGCC units will
be required to employ carbon capture and storage technology to meet the
proposed standard.  

  The Duke Energy
Registrants do not expect a material impact on their future results of
operations or cash flows based on the EPA s proposal. The final rule, however,
could be significantly different from the proposal. It is not known when the
EPA might finalize the rule.  

  On
June 25, 2013, the President of the United States issued a memorandum directing
the EPA to propose CO 2  emissions requirements for existing
fossil-fueled electric generating units by June 1, 2014, and to finalize the
guidelines for states to develop their own regulations for implementing the
guidelines by June 1, 2015. The memorandum directed the EPA to require states
to submit their implementation regulations for approval by June 30, 2016.  

  The
Duke Energy Registrants are unable to predict the outcome of this rulemaking,
but the impact could be significant.  

    Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)    

  The
final MATS rule, previously referred to as the Utility MACT Rule, was issued on
February 16, 2012. The final rule establishes emission limits for hazardous air
pollutants from new and existing coal-fired and oil-fired steam electric
generating units. The rule requires sources to comply with emission limits by
April 16, 2015. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), permitting authorities have the
discretion to grant up to a one-year compliance extension, on a case-by-case
basis, to sources that are unable to complete the installation of emission
controls before the compliance deadline. Strategies to achieve compliance with
the final rule will include installing new air emission control equipment,
developing monitoring processes, fuel switching, and accelerating retirement of
some coal-fired electric-generating units. For additional information, refer to
Note 4 regarding potential plant retirements.   

  Several
petitions for review of the final rule were filed with the D.C. Circuit Court.
A decision is expected in the first half of 2014. The Duke Energy Registrants
cannot predict the outcome of the litigation or how it might affect their
compliance with the MATS requirements.  

  Refer
to the table below for a summary of estimated costs to comply with the MATS
regulations.  

    Estimated Cost and Impacts of EPA Rulemakings    

  The ultimate
compliance requirements for MATS, Clean Water 316(b), CCRs and ELGs will not be
known until all the rules have been finalized. For planning purposes, the Duke
Energy Registrants currently estimate the cost of new control equipment that
may need to be installed on existing power plants to comply with these EPA
regulations could total $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, excluding AFUDC, over the
next 10 years. The table below includes estimated costs for new control
equipment necessary to comply with the MATS rule, which is the only rule that
has been finalized.  

The
Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power,
operation and maintenance, and other expenses, and costs for replacement
generation for potential coal-fired power plant retirements as a result of
these EPA regulations. The actual compliance costs incurred may be materially
different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the
final EPA regulations. The Duke Energy Registrants intend to seek rate recovery
of amounts incurred associated with regulated operations in complying with
these regulations. Refer to Note 4 for further information regarding potential
plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.  

   Litigation   

   Duke Energy    

    Dan
River Ash Basin Release    

  On
February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke
Energy Carolinas  retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin
water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was
installed in the stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the
river. Duke Energy Carolinas estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24
million to 27 million gallons of basin water were released into the river. Duke
Energy Carolinas continues to work with local and state officials responding to
this event. On February 10, 2014, Duke Energy received a subpoena for the
production of documents, issued by the United States Attorney for the Eastern
District of North Carolina in connection with a criminal investigation related
to the release. A second subpoena was issued by the same United States Attorney
on February 18, 2014, which expanded the document production to cover all
fourteen of the North Carolina facilities with coal ash ponds.  

  It
is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy will incur any liability or to
estimate the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with these matters.

Progress Energy Merger
Shareholder Litigation    

  On
May 31, 2013, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated four shareholder derivative
lawsuits filed in 2012. The Court also appointed a lead plaintiff and counsel
for plaintiffs and designated the case as    In Re Duke Energy Corporation
Derivative Litigation   . The lawsuit names as defendants eleven members of
the Duke Energy board of directors who were also members of the pre-merger Duke
Energy board of directors (Legacy Duke Energy Directors). Duke Energy is named
as a nominal defendant. The case alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties
of loyalty and care in connection with the post-merger change in CEO. The case
is stayed pending resolution of the    Nieman v. Duke Energy Corporation, et
al.    case in North Carolina.  

  On
August 3, 2012, Duke Energy was served with a shareholder Derivative Complaint,
which was transferred to the North Carolina Business Court (   Krieger v.
Johnson, et al.).    The lawsuit names as defendants, William D. Johnson and
the Legacy Duke Energy Directors. Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant.
The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty in granting excessive
compensation to Mr. Johnson. A decision on a motion to dismiss made by the
Legacy Duke Energy Directors remains pending.  

  Two shareholder Derivative Complaints, filed
in 2012 in federal district court in Delaware, were consolidated as    Tansey
v. Rogers, et al.    The case alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty and
waste of corporate assets, as well as claims under Section 14(a) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act. Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant.   On May 17,
2013, the judge granted defendants' motion to stay the litigation until a
decision is rendered on the motion to dismiss in the    Nieman v. Duke Energy
Corporation, et al   .    case in
North Carolina.  

  Duke Energy, the Legacy Duke Energy Directors
and certain Duke Energy officers are also defendants in a purported securities
class action lawsuit    (Nieman v. Duke Energy Corporation, et al)   . This
lawsuit consolidates three lawsuits originally filed in July 2012, and is
pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of North
Carolina. The plaintiffs allege federal Securities Act and Exchange Act claims
based on allegations of materially false and misleading representations and
omissions in the Registration Statement filed on July 7, 2011, and purportedly
incorporated into other documents, all in connection with the post-merger
change in CEO. The claims are purportedly brought on behalf of a class of all
persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Duke Energy securities between June
11, 2012 and July 9, 2012. On July 26, 2013, the Magistrate Judge recommended
the District Court Judge deny the defendants  motion to dismiss. On October 2,
2013, the District Judge heard defendants  objections to this recommendation. A
decision is pending on the motion to dismiss.  

  It is not possible to predict whether Duke
Energy will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, it might
incur in connection with these lawsuits.  

    Alaskan Global Warming Lawsuit    

  On
February 26, 2008, the governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska, filed
suit in the U.S. Federal Court for the Northern District of California against
various defendants including Duke Energy. On May 20, 2013, the plaintiffs 
Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court was denied, ending the case.  

    Price Reporting Cases    

  A
total of five lawsuits were filed against Duke Energy affiliates and other
energy companies and remain pending in a consolidated, single federal court
proceeding in Nevada.  

  Each
of these cases contain similar claims, that defendants  allegedly manipulated
natural gas markets by various means, including providing false information to
natural gas trade publications and entering into unlawful arrangements and
agreements in violation of the antitrust laws of the respective states.
Plaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts.  

  On
July 19, 2011, the judge granted a defendant s motion for summary judgment in
two of the remaining five cases to which Duke Energy affiliates are a party. The
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit subsequently reversed the lower
court s decision.     On
August 26, 2013, the defendants, including Duke Energy, filed a petition for
certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court, which remains pending.  

  It
is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy will incur any liability or to
estimate the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with the remaining
matters. However, based on Duke Energy s past experiences with similar cases of
this nature, it does not believe its exposure under these remaining matters is
material.

Crescent Resources Litigation    

  On September 3, 2010, the Crescent Resources
(Crescent) Litigation Trust sued Duke Energy along with various affiliates and
several individuals, including current and former employees of Duke Energy, in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas.  

  On November 15, 2013 the parties reached a

    Brazil Expansion Lawsuit     

  On August 9,
2011, the State of S o Paulo sued Duke Energy International Geracao
Paranapenema S.A. (DEIGP) in Brazilian state court. The lawsuit claims DEIGP is
under a continuing obligation to expand installed generation capacity in the
State of S o Paulo by 15 percent pursuant to a stock purchase agreement under
which DEIGP purchased generation assets from the state. On August 10, 2011, a
judge granted an ex parte injunction ordering DEIGP to present a detailed
expansion plan in satisfaction of the 15 percent obligation. DEIGP has
previously taken a position the expansion obligation is no longer viable given
changes that have occurred in the electric energy sector since privatization. DEIGP
submitted its proposed expansion plan on November 11, 2011, but reserved
objections regarding enforceability. No trial date has been set. It is not
possible to predict whether Duke Energy will incur any liability or to estimate
the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with this matter.  

   Duke Energy Carolinas    

    New Source Review (NSR)    

  In
1999-2000, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on behalf of the EPA filed a
number of complaints and notices of violation against multiple utilities, including
Duke Energy Carolinas, for alleged violations of the NSR provisions of the CAA.
The government alleges the utilities violated the CAA by not obtaining permits for
certain projects undertaken at certain coal plants or installing the best
available emission controls for SO 2 , NO x  and particulate
matter. The complaints seek the installation of pollution control technology on
various generating units that allegedly violated the CAA, and unspecified civil
penalties in amounts of up to $37,500 per day for each violation. Duke Energy
Carolinas asserts there were no CAA violations because the applicable
regulations do not require permitting in cases where the projects undertaken
are  routine  or otherwise do not result in a net increase in emissions.   

  In
2000, the government sued Duke Energy Carolinas in the U.S. District Court in
Greensboro, North Carolina. The EPA claims 29 projects performed at 25 of Duke
Energy Carolinas  coal-fired units violate the NSR provisions. Duke Energy
Carolinas asserts the projects were routine or not projected to increase
emissions. The parties filed a stipulation in which the United States dismissed
with prejudice 16 claims. In exchange, Duke Energy Carolinas dismissed certain
affirmative defenses. The parties filed opposing motions for summary judgment
on the remaining claims. In November 2013, the Court denied Duke Energy s
motion for summary judgment. A decision on the DOJ s motion for summary
judgment remains pending. Duke Energy requested leave to file another motion
for summary judgment on alternative grounds. That motion for leave, as well as
the Plaintiff s motion for summary judgment, remains pending.   

  It is not
possible to predict whether Duke Energy Carolinas will incur any liability or
to estimate the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with this matter.
Ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material effect on the
results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Duke Energy
Carolinas. However, the appropriate regulatory recovery will be pursued for
costs incurred in connection with such resolution.  

    Asbestos-related Injuries and Damages
Claims    

  Duke
Energy Carolinas has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and
medical cost reimbursement related to asbestos exposure. These claims relate to
damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from exposure to or use of
asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted
on its electric generation plants prior to 1985. As of December 31, 2013, there
were 96 asserted claims for non-malignant cases with the cumulative relief
sought of up to $24 million, and 31 asserted claims for malignant cases with
the cumulative relief sought of up to $11 million. Based on Duke Energy
Carolinas  experience, it is expected that the ultimate resolution of most of
these claims likely will be less than the amount claimed.   

  Duke
Energy Carolinas has recognized asbestos-related reserves of $616 million at December
31, 2013 and $751 million at December 31, 2012. These reserves are classified
in Other within Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities and Other within Current
Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These reserves are based upon
the minimum amount of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims
through 2033, are recorded on an undiscounted basis and incorporate anticipated
inflation. It is possible Duke Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities
in excess of the recorded reserves.  

  Duke
Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to
asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention
of $476 million. Duke Energy Carolinas  cumulative payments began to exceed the
self-insurance retention in 2008. Future payments up to the policy limit will
be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. The insurance policy limit
for potential future insurance recoveries indemnification and medical cost
claim payments is $897 million in excess of the self-insured retention. Receivables
for insurance recoveries were $649 million at December 31, 2013 and $781
million at December 31, 2012. These amounts are classified in Other within
Investments and Other Assets and Receivables on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the
legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas believes the
insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier
continues to have a strong financial strength rating.  

   Progress Energy    

    Synthetic

In a case filed in the
Circuit Court for Broward County, Florida, in March 2003 (the Florida Global
Case), Global requested an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, as well
as declaratory relief. In November 2009, the court ruled in favor of Global. In
December 2009, Progress Energy made a $154 million payment, which represented
payment of the total judgment, including prejudgment interest, and a required
premium equivalent to two years of interest, to the Broward County Clerk of
Court bond account. Progress Energy continued to accrue interest related to
this judgment.   

  On
October 3, 2012, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeals reversed the
lower court ruling. The court held that Global was entitled to approximately
$90 million of the amount paid into the registry of the court. Progress Energy
was entitled to a refund of the remainder of the funds. Progress Energy
received cash and recorded a $63 million pretax gain for the refund in December
2012. The gain was recorded in Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

  On
May 9, 2013, Global filed a Seventh Amended Complaint asserting a single count
for breach of the Asset Purchase Agreement and seeking specific performance. A
trial is scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 2014.  

  In
a second suit filed in the Superior Court for Wake County, N.C.,    Progress
Synfuel Holdings, Inc. et al. v. U.S. Global, LLC    (the North Carolina
Global Case), the Progress Energy Affiliates seek declaratory relief consistent
with their interpretation of the Asset Purchase Agreement. In August 2003, the
Wake County Superior Court stayed the North Carolina Global Case, pending the
outcome of the Florida Global Case. Based upon the verdict in the Florida
Global Case, Progress Energy anticipates dismissal of the North Carolina Global
Case.  

  Progress
Energy does not expect the resolution of these matters to have a material

   Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida   

    Spent Nuclear Fuel
Matters    

  On December 12, 2011, Duke
Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida sued the United States in the U.S.
Court of Federal Claims. The lawsuit claims the DOE breached a contract in
failing to accept spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982
and asserts damages for the cost of on-site storage. Claims for all periods
prior to 2006 have been resolved. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida
assert damages of $84 million and $21 million, respectively, for the period
January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2010. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy
Florida may file subsequent damage claims as they incur additional costs. Duke
Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this
matter.  

   Duke Energy Ohio    

    Antitrust Lawsuit    

  In
January 2008, four plaintiffs, including individual, industrial and nonprofit
customers, filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy Ohio in federal court in the
Southern District of Ohio. Plaintiffs alleged Duke Energy Ohio conspired to
provide inequitable and unfair price advantages for certain large business
consumers by entering into non-public option agreements in exchange for their
withdrawal of challenges to Duke Energy Ohio s Rate Stabilization Plan (RSP)
implemented in early 2005. A ruling is pending on the plaintiffs  motion to
certify this matter as a class action. It is not possible to predict whether
Duke Energy Ohio will incur any liability or to estimate the damages which may be
incurred in connection with this lawsuit.  

    Asbestos-related Injuries and Damages Claims    

  Duke
Energy Ohio has been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits related
to asbestos exposure at its electric generating stations. The impact on Duke
Energy Ohio s results of operations, cash flows or financial position of these
cases to date has not been material. Based on estimates under varying
assumptions concerning uncertainties, such as, among others: (i) the number of
contractors potentially exposed to asbestos during construction or maintenance
of Duke Energy Ohio generating plants, (ii) the possible incidence of various
illnesses among exposed workers, and (iii) the potential settlement costs
without federal or other legislation that addresses asbestos tort actions, Duke
Energy Ohio estimates that the range of reasonably possible exposure in
existing and future suits over the foreseeable future is not material. This assessment
may change as additional settlements occur, claims are made, and more case law
is established.   

   Duke Energy Indiana    

    Edwardsport IGCC     

  On December 11, 2012,
Duke Energy Indiana filed an arbitration action against General Electric

than $560 million. An arbitration hearing is scheduled for October 2014. Duke
Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

   General    

  As part of their
normal business, the Duke Energy Registrants are party to various financial
guarantees, performance guarantees, and other contractual commitments to extend
guarantees of credit and other assistance to various subsidiaries, investees,
and other third parties. These guarantees involve elements of performance and
credit risk, which are not fully recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
and have unlimited maximum potential payments. However, the Duke Energy
Registrants do not believe these guarantees will have a material effect on their
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  

   Purchase Obligations   

    Purchased Power    

  Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida,
and Duke Energy Ohio have ongoing purchased power contracts, including
renewable energy contracts, with other utilities, wholesale marketers, co-generators,
and qualified facilities (QFs). These purchased power contracts generally
provide for capacity and energy payments. In addition, Duke Energy Progress,
Duke Energy Florida, and Duke Energy Ohio have various contracts to secure
transmission rights.  

  The following table presents executory
purchased power contracts, excluding contracts classified as leases.  

Operating and Capital Lease Commitments   

  The
Duke Energy Registrants lease office buildings, railcars, vehicles, computer
equipment and other property and equipment with various terms and expiration
dates. Additionally, Duke Energy Progress has a capital lease related to firm
gas pipeline transportation capacity. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy
Florida have entered into certain purchased power agreements, which are
classified as leases. Consolidated capitalized lease obligations are classified
as Long-term debt or Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is
included in Depreciation and amortization and Fuel used in electric generation
  regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

  The
following table presents rental expense for operating leases. These amounts are
included in Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

years and thereafter. Amounts presented exclude short-term notes payable and
commercial paper and money pool borrowings for the Subsidiary Registrants.  

The
Duke Energy Registrants have the ability under certain debt facilities to call
and repay the obligation prior to its scheduled maturity. Therefore, the actual
timing of future cash repayments could be materially different than as
presented above.   

   Short-term
Obligations Classified as Long-term Debt   

  Tax-exempt
bonds that may be put to the Company at the option of the holder and certain
commercial paper issuances and money pool borrowings are classified as
Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These tax-exempt bonds,
commercial paper issuances and money pool borrowings, which are short-term
obligations by nature, are classified as long term due to Duke Energy s intent
and ability to utilize such borrowings as long-term financing. As Duke Energy s
master credit facility and other bilateral letter of credit agreements have
non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of the balance sheet date, Duke
Energy has the ability to refinance these short-term obligations on a long-term
basis. The following tables show short-term obligations classified as long-term
debt.

Available Credit
Facilities    

  Duke Energy has a master credit facility with
a capacity of $6 billion through December 2018. The Subsidiary Registrants,
excluding Progress Energy each have borrowing capacity under the master credit
facility up to specified sublimits for each borrower. Duke Energy has the
unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits
of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount
available under the master credit facility has been reduced to backstop the issuances
of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand
tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option
of the holder. The table below includes the current borrowing sublimits and
available capacity under the master credit facility.  

Other
Debt Matters   

  In September 2013, Duke Energy filed a
registration statement (Form S-3) with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is
uncapped, the Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may issue
debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be
determined at the time of future offerings. The registration statement also
allows for the issuance of common stock by Duke Energy.  

  Duke
Energy has an effective Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to $3 billion of
variable denomination floating-rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form
S-3 states that no more than $1.5 billion of the notes will be outstanding at
any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear
interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy
PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate
payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of
the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable
and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investor s
option at any time. The balance as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $836
million and $395 million, respectively. The notes are short-term debt
obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper
on Duke Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

  At December 31, 2013 and 2012, $811
million and $734 million, respectively, of debt issued by Duke Energy Carolinas
was guaranteed by Duke Energy.  

   Money Pool       

  The Subsidiary Registrants,
excluding Progress Energy receive support for their short-term borrowing needs
through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries in a
money pool arrangement. Under this arrangement, those companies with short-term
funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating in this
arrangement. The money pool is structured such that the Subsidiary Registrants,
excluding Progress Energy separately manage their cash needs and working
capital requirements. Accordingly, there is no net settlement of receivables and
payables between money pool participants. Duke Energy (Parent), may loan funds
to its participating subsidiaries, but may not borrow funds through the money
pool. Accordingly, as the money pool activity is between Duke Energy and its
wholly owned subsidiaries, all money pool balances are eliminated within Duke
Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

  Money pool receivable balances are
reflected within Notes receivable from affiliated companies on the respective
Subsidiary Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets. Money pool payable
balances are reflected within either Notes payable to affiliated companies or
Long-term debt payable to affiliated companies on the respective Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  

   Restrictive
Debt Covenants   

  The
Duke Energy Registrants  debt and credit agreements contain various financial
and other covenants. The master credit facility contains a covenant requiring
the debt-to-total capitalization ratio not exceed 65 percent for each borrower.
Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in
accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31,
2013, each of the Duke Energy Registrants were in compliance with all covenants
related to its significant debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements
may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to
nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower
or some of its subsidiaries. None of the significant debt or credit agreements
contain material adverse change clauses.

During 2013 and 2012, Duke Energy and Duke
Energy Progress had loans outstanding against the cash surrender value of life
insurance policies it owns on the lives of its executives. The amounts
outstanding were $571 million, including $48 million at Duke Energy Progress
and $496 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The amounts
outstanding were carried as a reduction of the related cash surrender value
that is included in Other within Investments and Other Assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

7. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS    

Duke Energy and
Progress Energy have various financial and performance guarantees and
indemnifications, which are issued in the normal course of business. As
discussed below, these contracts include performance guarantees, stand-by
letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. Duke
Energy and Progress Energy enter into these arrangements to facilitate
commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the
transaction to the third party. At December 31, 2013, Duke Energy and Progress
Energy do not believe conditions are likely for significant performance under
these guarantees. To the extent liabilities are incurred as a result of the
activities covered by the guarantees, such liabilities are included on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

  On January 2, 2007,
Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas businesses to
shareholders. Guarantees issued by Duke Energy or its affiliates, or assigned
to Duke Energy prior to the spin-off, remained with Duke Energy subsequent to
the spin-off. Guarantees issued by Spectra Energy Capital, LLC, formerly known
as Duke Capital LLC, (Spectra Capital) or its affiliates prior to the spin-off
remained with Spectra Capital subsequent to the spin-off, except for guarantees
that were later assigned to Duke Energy. Duke Energy has indemnified Spectra
Capital against any losses incurred under certain of the guarantee obligations
that remain with Spectra Capital. At December 31, 2013, the maximum potential
amount of future payments associated with these guarantees was $205 million,
the majority of which expires by 2028.   

  Duke Energy has issued
performance guarantees to customers and other third parties that guarantee the
payment and performance of other parties, including certain non-wholly owned entities,
as well as guarantees of debt of certain non-consolidated entities and less
than wholly owned consolidated entities. If such entities were to default on
payments or performance, Duke Energy would be required under the guarantees to
make payments on the obligations of the less than wholly owned entity. The
maximum potential amount of future payments required under these guarantees as
of December 31, 2013, was $285 million. Of this amount, $15 million relates to
guarantees issued on behalf of less than wholly owned consolidated entities,
with the remainder related to guarantees issued on behalf of third parties and
unconsolidated affiliates of Duke Energy. Of the guarantees noted above, $102
million of the guarantees expire between 2015 and 2033, with the remaining
performance guarantees having no contractual expiration.   

  Duke Energy has guaranteed certain issuers of
surety bonds, obligating itself to make payment upon the failure of a wholly
owned and former non-wholly owned entity to honor its obligations to a third
party. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations that are
triggered by a draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of the
wholly owned or former non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the
terms of its underlying contract. At December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had
guaranteed $92 million of outstanding surety bonds. Of this amount, $54
million, expire in 2014, the remaining expires between 2015   2021.   

  At December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had $457
million of unused bank-issued stand-by letters of credit to secure the
performance of wholly owned and non-wholly owned entities to a third party or
customer.  

  Duke Energy and Progress
Energy has issued indemnifications for certain asset performance, legal, tax
and environmental matters to third parties, including indemnifications made in
connection with sales of businesses. At December 31, 2013, the estimated
maximum exposure for these indemnifications was $117 million, the majority of
which expires in 2017. Of this amount, $7 million has no contractual
expiration. For certain matters for which Progress Energy receives timely
notice, indemnity obligations may extend beyond the notice period. Certain
indemnifications related to discontinued operations have no limitations as to
time or maximum potential future payments.  

  The following table
includes the liabilities recognized for the guarantees discussed above. These
amounts are primarily recorded in Other within Deferred Credits and other
Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As current estimates change,
additional losses related to guarantees and indemnifications to third parties,
which could be material, may be recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants in the
future. The decrease in 2013 was mainly due the expiration of guarantees. Accruals
and expenditures were not material.  

8.     Joint Ownership of Generating and Transmission
Facilities   

The
Duke Energy Registrants hold ownership interests in certain jointly owned
generating and transmission facilities. The Duke Energy Registrants are
entitled to shares of the generating capacity and output of each unit equal to
their respective ownership interests. The Duke Energy Registrants pay their
ownership share of additional construction costs, fuel inventory purchases and
operating expenses, except in certain instances where agreements have been
executed to limit certain joint owners  maximum exposure to the additional
costs. The Duke Energy Registrants share of revenues and operating costs of the
jointly owned generating facilities is included within the corresponding line
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Each participant in the jointly
owned facilities must provide its own financing, except in certain instances
where agreements have been executed to limit certain joint owners  maximum
exposure to the additional costs.

9.     Asset Retirement Obligations   

Asset
retirement obligations recognized by Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke
Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida relate primarily to decommissioning
nuclear power facilities, asbestos removal and closure of landfills at fossil
generation facilities. Asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy Ohio relate
primarily to the retirement of gas mains, asbestos removal and closure of landfills
at fossil generation facilities. Asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy
Indiana relate primarily to obligations associated with asbestos removal and
closure of landfills at fossil generation facilities. Duke Energy also has
asset retirement obligations related to the removal of renewable energy
generation assets in addition to the above items. Certain of the Duke Energy
Registrants  assets have an indeterminate life, such as transmission and
distribution facilities, and thus the fair value of the retirement obligation
is not reasonably estimable. A liability for these asset retirement obligations
will be recorded when a fair value is determinable.   

  The following table presents changes in the
liability associated with asset retirement obligations.

The
Duke Energy Registrants  regulated operations accrue costs of removal for
property that does not have an associated legal retirement obligation based on
regulatory orders from state commissions. These costs of removal are recorded
as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting treatment.
The Duke Energy Registrants do not accrue the estimated cost of removal for any
nonregulated assets. See Note 4 for the estimated cost of removal for assets
without an associated legal retirement obligation, which are included in
Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

   Nuclear
Decommissioning Costs    

  Use
of the NDTF investments are restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities.
The NDTF investments are managed and invested in accordance with applicable
requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, FERC, NCUC, PSCSC,
FPSC and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The fair value of assets legally
restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations associated
with nuclear decommissioning are $4,769 million and $2,477 million for Duke
Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas at December 31, 2013, respectively, and $3,941
million and $2,053 million for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas at
December 31, 2012, respectively. The NDTF balances for Progress Energy, Duke
Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida represent the fair value of assets
legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations
associated with nuclear decommissioning. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require
updated cost estimates for decommissioning nuclear plants every five years.

  Progress
Energy had Goodwill of $3,655 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, for
which there are no accumulated impairment charges.  

   Impairment Analysis   

  As
the fair values of the reporting units of Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke
Energy Ohio exceeded their respective carrying values at the date of the annual
goodwill impairment analysis, no impairment charges were recorded.  

  In
addition, at December 31, 2013, goodwill for the Renewables reporting unit
within Commercial Power was analyzed for impairment primarily as a result of the
expiration of wind production tax credits at the end of 2013. Based on results
of the fourth quarter 2013 impairment analysis, the fair value of the
Renewables reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment was
recorded. The fair value of the Renewables reporting unit is impacted by a
multitude of factors, including legislative actions related to tax credit
extensions, long-term growth rate assumptions, the market price of power and
discount rates. Management continues to monitor these assumptions for any
indicators that the fair value of the reporting unit could be below the
carrying value, and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate.

Intangible Assets   

  The
following tables show the carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible
assets.  

Impairment of Emission Allowances   

  On
August 8, 2011, the EPA s final rule to replace CAIR was published in the
Federal Register. As further discussed in Note 5, CSAPR established state-level
annual SO 2  and NO x  caps that were required to take effect
on January 1, 2012, and state-level ozone-season NO x  caps that were
to take effect on May 1, 2012. CSAPR did not utilize CAA emission allowances as
the original CAIR provided. Under CSAPR, the EPA was expected to issue new
emission allowances to be used exclusively for purposes of complying with CSAPR
cap-and-trade program. After this ruling was published in 2011, Duke Energy evaluated
the effect of CSAPR on the carrying value of emission allowances recorded at
its Regulated Utilities and Commercial Power segments. Based on the provisions
of CSAPR, Duke Energy Ohio had more SO 2  allowances than were needed
to comply with the continuing CAA acid rain cap-and-trade program (excess
emission allowances). Duke Energy Ohio incurred a pretax impairment of $79
million in 2011 to write down the carrying value of excess emission allowances
held by Commercial Power to fair value. The charge is recorded in Goodwill and
other impairment charges on Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Statements of
Operations. This amount was based on the fair value of excess allowances held
by Commercial Power for compliance under the continuing CAA acid rain
cap-and-trade program as of September 30, 2011.  

The
table below shows the expected amortization expense for the next five years for
intangible assets as of December 31, 2013. The expected amortization expense
includes estimates of emission allowances consumption and estimates of
consumption of commodities such

as gas and coal under
existing contracts, as well as estimated amortization related to the wind
development projects. The amortization amounts discussed below are estimates
and actual amounts may differ from these estimates due to such factors as
changes in consumption patterns, sales or impairments of emission allowances or
other intangible assets, delays in the in-service dates of wind assets,
additional intangible acquisitions and other events.   

12. INVESTMENTS IN
UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES    

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS   

  Investments
in domestic and international affiliates that are not controlled by Duke
Energy, but over which it has significant influence, are accounted for using
the equity method. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying amount
of investments in affiliates with carrying amounts greater than zero
approximated the amount of underlying equity in net assets.  

  The
following table presents Duke Energy s investments in unconsolidated affiliates
accounted for under the equity method, as well as the respective equity in
earnings, by segment.   

During the years ended December
31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Duke Energy received distributions from equity
investments of $144 million, $183 million and $149 million, respectively, which
are included in Other assets within Cash Flows from Operating Activities on the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  

  Significant
investments in affiliates accounted for under the equity method are discussed
below.   

    International Energy    

  Duke Energy owns a 25
percent indirect interest in NMC, which owns and operates a methanol and MTBE
business in Jubail, Saudi Arabia.   

    Commercial Power    

  Investments accounted
for under the equity method primarily consist of Duke Energy s approximate 50
percent ownership interest in the five Catamount Sweetwater, LLC wind farm
projects (Phase I-V), INDU Solar Holdings, LLC and DS Cornerstone, LLC. All of
these entities own solar or wind power projects in the United States. Duke
Energy also owns a 50 percent interest in Duke American Transmission Co., LLC
which builds, owns and operates electric transmission facilities in North
America.  

    Other    

  As of December 31, 2012, investments
accounted for under the equity method primarily included a 50 percent ownership
interest in DukeNet, which owns and operates telecommunications businesses. On December
31, 2013, Duke Energy completed the sale of its ownership interest in DukeNet
to Time Warner Cable, Inc. After retiring existing DukeNet debt and payment of
transactions expenses, Duke Energy received $215 million in cash proceeds and
recorded a $105 million pretax gain in the fourth quarter of 2013.

The Subsidiary Registrants are charged their proportionate share
  of corporate governance and other costs by unconsolidated affiliates that are
  consolidated affiliates of Duke Energy and Progress Energy. Corporate
  governance and other shared services costs are primarily related to human
  resources, employee benefits, legal and accounting fees, as well as other
  third-party costs. These amounts are recorded in Operation, maintenance and
  other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
  See Note 21 for additional information.  

(b)  

The Subsidiary Registrants incur expenses related to certain
  indemnification coverages through Bison, Duke Energy s wholly owned captive
  insurance subsidiary. These expenses are recorded in Operation, maintenance
  and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
  Income.  

(c)  

Effective with the consummation of the merger between Duke
  Energy and Progress Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress
  began to participate in a JDA. The JDA allows the collective dispatch of
  power plants between service territories to reduce customer rates. Revenues
  from the sale of power under the JDA are recorded in Operating Revenues and
  expenses from the purchase of power under the JDA are recorded in Fuel used
  in electric generation and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of
  Operations and Comprehensive Income.  

(d)  

Progress Energy charges a proportionate share of corporate
  governance and other costs to unconsolidated affiliates that are consolidated
  affiliates of Duke Energy. Corporate governance and other shared costs are
  primarily related to human resources, employee benefits, legal and accounting
  fees, as well as other third-party costs. These charges are recorded as an
  offset to Operation, maintenance and other in the Statements of Operations
  and Comprehensive Income.

Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)      

In
addition to the amounts presented above, the Subsidiary Registrants record the
impact on net income of other affiliate transactions, including rental of
office space, participation in a money pool arrangement, other operational
transactions and their proportionate share of certain charged expenses. See
Note 6 for more information regarding money pool. The net impact of these
transactions was not material for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011
for the Subsidiary Registrants.  

  As
discussed in Note 17, certain trade receivables have been sold by Duke Energy
Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana to CRC, an affiliate formed by a subsidiary of
Duke Energy. The proceeds obtained from the sales of receivables are largely
cash but do include a subordinated note from CRC for a portion of the purchase
price.   

  In
January 2012, Duke Energy Ohio recorded a non-cash equity transfer of $28
million related to the sale of Vermilion to Duke Energy Indiana. Duke Energy
Indiana recorded a non-cash after-tax equity transfer of $26 million for the
purchase of Vermillion from Duke Energy Ohio. See Note 2 for further
discussion.   

  Duke Energy Commercial
Asset Management (DECAM) is a nonregulated, direct subsidiary of Duke Energy
Ohio. DECAM conducts business activities including the execution of commodity
transactions, third-party vendor and supply contracts, and service contracts for
certain of Duke Energy s nonregulated entities. The commodity contracts DECAM
enters are accounted for as undesignated contracts or NPNS. Consequently, mark-to-market
impacts of intercompany contracts with, and sales of power to, nonregulated
entities are reflected in Duke Energy Ohio s Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Income. These amounts totaled net expense of $6 million and
net revenue of $24 million and $18 million, respectively, for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Because it is not a rated entity, DECAM
receives its credit support from Duke Energy or its nonregulated subsidiaries
and not the regulated utility operations of Duke Energy Ohio. DECAM meets its
funding needs through an intercompany loan agreement from a subsidiary of Duke
Energy. DECAM also has the ability to loan money to the subsidiary of Duke
Energy. DECAM had an outstanding intercompany loan payable of $43 million and $79
million, respectively, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. This amount is
recorded in Notes payable to affiliated companies on Duke Energy Ohio s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Combined Notes To

Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)      

The Duke Energy Registrants use commodity and
interest rate contracts to manage commodity price and interest rate risks. The
primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation
portfolio against changes in the prices of electricity and natural gas.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage interest rate risk associated with
borrowings.   

  All
derivative instruments not identified as NPNS are recorded at fair value as
assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral related
to derivative instruments executed under master netting agreement is offset
against the collateralized derivatives on the balance sheet.  

  Changes
in the fair value of derivative agreements that either do not qualify for or
have not been designated as hedges are reflected in current earnings or as
regulatory assets or liabilities.  

   Commodity
Price Risk    

  The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to
the impact of changes in the future prices of electricity, coal, and natural
gas. Exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors
including the term of contracts, the liquidity of markets, and delivery
locations.  

   Commodity Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges   

  At December 31, 2013, there were no open
commodity derivative instruments designated as hedges.  

   Undesignated Contracts   

  Undesignated contracts may include contracts
not designated as a hedge, contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting,
derivatives that do not or no longer qualify for the NPNS scope exception, and
de-designated hedge contracts. These contracts expire as late as 2018.  

  Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy
Progress have entered into firm power sale agreements, which are accounted for
as derivatives, as part of the Interim FERC Mitigation in connection with Duke
Energy s merger with Progress Energy. See Note 2 for further information. Duke
Energy Carolinas  undesignated contracts are primarily associated with forward
sales and purchases of electricity. Duke Energy Progress  and Duke Energy
Florida s undesignated contracts are primarily associated with forward
purchases of natural gas. Duke Energy Ohio s undesignated contracts are
primarily associated with forward sales and purchases of electricity, coal, and
natural gas. Duke Energy Indiana s undesignated contracts are primarily
associated with forward purchases and sales of electricity and financial
transmission rights.  

   Volumes    

  The tables show
information relating to the volume of the outstanding commodity derivatives.
Amounts disclosed represent the notional volumes of commodity contracts
excluding NPNS. Amounts disclosed represent the absolute value of notional
amounts. The Duke Energy Registrants have netted contractual amounts where
offsetting purchase and sale contracts exist with identical delivery locations
and times of delivery. Where all commodity positions are perfectly offset, no
quantities are shown  .   

Interest
Rate Risk    

  The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to
changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance or anticipated issuance
of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Interest rate risk
is managed by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt
and by monitoring changes in interest rates. To manage risk associated with
changes in interest rates, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into interest
rate swaps, U.S. Treasury lock agreements, and other financial contracts. In
anticipation of certain fixed-rate debt issuances, a series of forward starting
interest rate swaps may be executed to lock in components of current market
interest rates. These instruments are later terminated prior to or upon the
issuance of the corresponding debt. Pretax gains or losses recognized from
inception to termination of the hedges are amortized as a component of interest
expense over the life of the debt.  

  Duke Energy has a combination foreign
exchange, pay fixed-receive floating interest rate swap to fix the US dollar equivalent
payments on a floating-rate Chilean debt issue.  

  The following tables show notional
amounts for derivatives related to interest rate risk.

There
was no hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended  December 31, 2013, 2012,
and 2011, and no gains or losses have been excluded from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness during the same periods.  

  At
December 31, 2013, and 2012, $61 million and $65 million, respectively of pretax
deferred net losses on derivative instruments related to interest rate cash
flow hedges were included as a component of AOCI. A $5 million pretax loss is
expected to be recognized in earnings during the next 12 months as interest
expense.

  The following table
shows the fair value of derivatives and the line items in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets where they are reported. Although derivatives subject to master
netting arrangements are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the fair
values presented below are shown gross and cash collateral on the derivatives
has not been netted against the fair values shown.   

The tables below show the balance sheet
location of derivative contracts subject to enforceable master netting
agreements and include collateral posted to offset the net position. This
disclosure is intended to enable users to evaluate the effect of netting
arrangements on financial position. The amounts shown were calculated by

CREDIT
RISK   

  Certain derivative contracts contain
contingent credit features. These features may include (i) material adverse
change clauses or payment acceleration clauses that could result in immediate
payments, (ii) the posting of letters of credit or termination of the
derivative contract before maturity if specific events occur, such as a credit
rating downgrade below investment grade.   

  The following tables show information with
respect to derivative contracts that are in a net liability position and
contain objective credit-risk related payment provisions.   

The
Duke Energy Registrants have elected to offset cash collateral and fair values
of derivatives. For amounts to be netted, the derivative must be executed with
the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. Amounts
disclosed below represent the receivables related to the right to reclaim cash
collateral and payables related to the obligation to return cash collateral
under master netting arrangements.

    Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities   

The Duke Energy Registrants classify their
investments in debt and equity securities as either trading or
available-for-sale.   

   TRADING SECURITIES   

  Investments in debt and equity securities
held in grantor trusts associated with certain deferred compensation plans and
certain other investments are classified as trading securities. The fair value
of these investments was $18 million as of December 31, 2013 and $33 million as
of December 31, 2012.  

   AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES   

  All
other investments in debt and equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale securities.   

  Duke Energy s available-for-sale securities
are primarily comprised of investments held in (i) the NDTF at Duke Energy
Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, (ii) grantor trusts at
Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana related to OPEB
plans, (iii) Duke Energy s captive insurance investment portfolio, and (iv) Duke
Energy s foreign operations investment portfolio.   

  Duke Energy holds corporate debt securities that
were purchased using excess cash from its foreign operations. These investments
are classified as Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
are available for current operations of Duke Energy s foreign business. The
fair value of these investments was $44 million as of December 31, 2013 and
$333 million as of December 31, 2012.  

  Duke Energy classifies
all other investments in debt and equity securities as non-current, unless
otherwise noted  .

NDTF and Grantor Trust   

  The investments within the NDTF at Duke
Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida and the Duke
Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana grantor trusts
(Investment Trusts) are managed by independent investment managers with
discretion to buy, sell, and invest pursuant to the objectives set forth by the
trust agreements. The Duke Energy Registrants have limited oversight of
day-to-day management of these investments. As a result, the ability to hold
investments in unrealized loss positions is outside the control of the Duke
Energy Registrants. Accordingly, all unrealized gains and losses associated
with debt and equity securities within the Investment Trusts are considered other-than-temporary
impairments and are recognized immediately. Pursuant to regulatory accounting,
substantially all realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with
investments within the Investment Trusts are deferred as a regulatory asset or
liability. As a result, there is no immediate impact on earnings of the Duke
Energy Registrants.   

   Other Available for
Sale Securities   

  Unrealized gains and losses on all other
available-for-sale securities are included in other comprehensive income until
realized, unless it is determined the carrying value of an investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists,
the unrealized loss may be included in earnings based on the criteria discussed
below.   

  The Duke Energy Registrants analyze all
investment holdings each reporting period to determine whether a decline in
fair value should be considered other-than-temporary. Criteria used to evaluate
whether an impairment associated with equity securities is other-than-temporary
includes, but is not limited to, (i) the length of time over which the market
value has been lower than the cost basis of the investment, (ii) the percentage
decline compared to the cost of the investment, and (iii) management s intent
and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow
for any anticipated recovery in market value. If a decline in fair value is
determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its
fair value through a charge to earnings.   

  If the entity does not
have an intent to sell a debt security and it is not more likely than not
management will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of
its cost basis, the impairment write-down to fair value would be recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income, except for when it is determined a
credit loss exists. In determining whether a credit loss exists, management
considers, among other things, (i) the length of time and the extent to which
the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, (ii) changes in the
financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset
backed security, the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors, (iii)
consideration of underlying collateral and guarantees of amounts by government
entities, (iv) ability of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest
or principal payments, and (v) any changes to the rating of the security by
rating agencies. If a credit loss exists, the amount of impairment write-down
to fair value is split between credit loss and other factors. The amount
related to credit loss is

16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   

Fair
value is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The
fair value definition focuses on an exit price versus the acquisition cost. Fair
value measurements use market data or assumptions market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the
risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs may be
readily observable, corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable.
Valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize use of
unobservable inputs. A midmarket pricing convention (the midpoint price between
bid and ask prices) is permitted for use as a practical expedient.   

  Fair value measurements are classified in
three levels based on the fair value hierarchy:   

   Level
1      Unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting
entity can access at the measurement date. An active market is one in which
transactions for an asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and
volume to provide ongoing pricing information.  

   Level
2      A
fair value measurement utilizing inputs other than quoted prices included in
Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for an asset or
liability. Inputs include (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities
in active markets, (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in markets that are not active, (iii) and inputs other than quoted
market prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest
rate curves and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals,
volatilities, and credit spreads. A Level 2 measurement cannot have more than
an insignificant portion of its valuation based on unobservable inputs.
Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives, such as
over-the-counter forwards, swaps and options; certain marketable debt
securities; and financial instruments traded in less than active markets.   

   Level
3      Any
fair value measurement which includes unobservable inputs for more than an
insignificant portion of the valuation. These inputs may be used with
internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of
fair value. Level 3 measurements may include longer-term instruments that
extend into periods in which observable inputs are not available.  

  The
fair value accounting guidance permits entities to elect to measure certain
financial instruments that are not required to be accounted for at fair value,
such as equity method investments or the company s own debt, at fair value. The
Duke Energy Registrants have not elected to record any of these items at fair
value.   

  Transfers
between levels represent assets or liabilities that were previously (i) categorized
at a higher level for which the inputs to the estimate became less observable
or (ii) classified at a lower level for which the inputs became more observable
during the period. The Duke Energy Registrant s policy is to recognize
transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the period. There
were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the years ended December 31,
2013 and 2012. Transfers out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2013
are the result of forward commodity prices becoming observable due to the
passage of time.  

  Valuation methods of the primary fair value
measurements disclosed below are as follows.  

   Investments
in equity securities   

  The
majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1
measurements. Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the
closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the
quarter. Principal active markets for equity prices include

published exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE. Foreign
equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency
exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. There was
no after-hours market activity that was required to be reflected in the
reported fair value measurements. Investments in equity securities that are Level
2 or 3 are typically ownership interests in commingled investment funds.   

   Investments
in debt securities   

  Most
investments in debt securities are valued using Level 2 measurements because
the valuations uses interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the
terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider
the counterparty credit rating. If the market for a particular fixed income
security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3.  

   Commodity
derivatives   

  Commodity
derivatives with clearinghouses are classified as Level 1. Other commodity
derivatives are primarily fair valued using internally developed discounted
cash flow models which incorporate forward price, adjustments for liquidity
(bid-ask spread) and credit or non-performance risk (after reflecting credit
enhancements such as collateral), and are discounted to present value. Pricing
inputs are derived from published exchange transaction prices and other
observable data sources. In the absence of an active market, the last available
price may be used. If forward price curves are not observable for the full term
of the contract and the unobservable period had more than an insignificant
impact on the valuation, the commodity derivative is classified as Level 3. In
isolation, increases (decreases) in natural gas forward prices result in
favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustments for gas purchase contracts; and
increases (decreases) in electricity forward prices result in unfavorable
(favorable) fair value adjustments for electricity sales contracts. Duke Energy
regularly evaluates and validates pricing inputs used to estimate fair value of
gas commodity contracts by a market participant price verification procedure.
This procedure provides a comparison of internal forward commodity curves to
market participant generated curves.  

   Interest
rate derivatives   

  Most
over-the-counter interest rate contract derivatives are valued using financial
models which utilize observable inputs for similar instruments and are
classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward interest rate curves, notional
amounts, interest rates and credit quality of the counterparties.

and long-lived assets

17. VARIABLE INTEREST
ENTITIES   

A
VIE is an entity that is evaluated for consolidation using more than a simple
analysis of voting control. The analysis to determine whether an entity is a
VIE considers contracts with an entity, credit support for an entity, the
adequacy of the equity investment of an entity and the relationship of voting
power to the amount of equity invested in an entity. This analysis is performed
either upon the creation of a legal entity or upon the occurrence of an event
requiring reevaluation, such as a significant change in an entity s assets or
activities. A qualitative analysis of control determines the party that
consolidates a VIE. This assessment is based on (i) what party has the power to
direct the most significant activities of the VIE that impact its economic
performance, and (ii) what party has rights to receive benefits or is obligated
to absorb losses that are significant to the VIE. The analysis of the party
that consolidates a VIE is a continual reassessment. Other than the discussion
below related to CRC, no financial support was provided to any of the VIEs
during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, or is expected to be
provided in the future, that was not previously     contractually required.  

   CONSOLIDATED VIEs    

  The
table below shows the VIEs that Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke
Energy Progress consolidate and how these entities impact their respective

The obligations of these VIEs are
non-recourse to Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress.
These entities have no requirement to provide liquidity to purchase assets of,
or guarantee performance of these VIEs unless noted in the following
paragraphs.  

   DERF   

  On a daily basis, Duke Energy Receivables
Finance Company, LLC (DERF), a bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiary of
Duke Energy Carolinas, buys certain accounts receivable arising from the sale
of electricity and/or related services from Duke Energy Carolinas. DERF is a
wholly owned limited liability company with a separate legal existence from its
parent, and its assets are not generally available to creditors of Duke Energy
Carolinas. DERF borrows $400 million under a credit facility to buy the
receivables. Borrowing is limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold,
which is expected to be in excess of $400 million. The receivables are used as
collateral for commercial paper issued through third parties. The credit
facility expires in October 2016 and is reflected on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets as Long-term Debt. The secured credit facility was not structured to
meet the criteria for sale accounting treatment under the accounting guidance
for transfers and servicing of financial assets.  

  The most significant activity that impacts
the economic performance of DERF is the decisions made to manage delinquent
receivables. Duke Energy Carolinas consolidates DERF as it makes those
decisions.  

   DEPR   

  On a daily basis, Duke Energy Progress
Receivables Company, LLC (DEPR), a bankruptcy remote, special purpose
subsidiary of Duke Energy Progress formed in 2013, buys certain accounts
receivable arising from the sale of electricity and/or related services from
Duke Energy Progress. DEPR is a wholly owned limited liability company with a separate
legal existence from its parent, and its assets are not generally available to
creditors of Duke Energy Progress. DEPR borrows $300 million under a credit
facility to buy the receivables. Borrowing is limited to the amount of
qualified receivables sold, which is expected to be in excess of $300 million. The
receivables are used as collateral for commercial paper issued through third
parties. The credit facility expires in December 2016 and is reflected on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-term Debt. The secured credit facility was
not structured to meet the criteria for sale accounting treatment under the
accounting guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets.  

  The most significant activity that impacts
the economic performance of DEPR is the decisions made to manage delinquent
receivables. Duke Energy Progress consolidates DEPR as it makes those decisions.  

   CRC   

  On a revolving basis, CRC buys certain
accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and/or related
services from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Receivables sold are
securitized by CRC through a facility managed by two unrelated third parties
and are used as collateral for commercial paper issued by the unrelated third
parties. Proceeds Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana receive from the sale
of receivables to CRC are typically 75 percent cash and 25 percent in the form
of a subordinated note from CRC. The subordinated note is a retained interest
in the receivables sold. Cash collections from the receivable are the sole
source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligation. Depending on experience
with collections, additional equity infusions to CRC may be required by Duke
Energy to maintain a minimum equity balance of $3 million. There were no
infusions to CRC during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. For the
year ended December 31, 2011, Duke Energy infused $6 million of equity to CRC
to remedy net worth deficiencies. Borrowings fluctuate based on the amount of receivables
sold. The credit facility expires in November 2016. The secured credit facility
is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-term Debt. CRC is
considered a VIE because (i) equity capitalization is insufficient to support
its operations, (ii) power to direct the most significant activities that
impact economic performance of the entity are not performed by the equity
holder, Cinergy, and (iii) deficiencies in net worth of CRC are not funded by
Cinergy, but by Duke Energy. The most significant activity of CRC relates to
the

decisions made with respect to the management of
delinquent receivables. Duke Energy consolidates CRC as it makes these
decisions. Neither Duke Energy Ohio nor Duke Energy Indiana consolidate CRC.  

   CinCap V   

  CinCap V was created to finance and execute a
power sale agreement with Central Maine Power Company for approximately 35 MW
of capacity and energy. This agreement expires in 2016. CinCap V is considered
a VIE because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its
operations. Duke Energy consolidates CinCap V as it has power to direct the
most significant activities that impact the economic performance of the entity,
which are the decisions to hedge and finance the power sales agreement.  

   Renewables   

  Certain of Duke Energy s renewable energy
facilities are VIEs due to power purchase agreements with terms that
approximate the expected life of the projects. These fixed price agreements
effectively transfer commodity price risk to the buyer of the power. Certain
other of Duke Energy s renewable energy facilities are VIEs due to Duke Energy
issuing guarantees for debt service and operations and maintenance reserves in
support of debt financings. Assets are restricted and cannot be pledged as
collateral or sold to third parties without prior approval of debt holders. The
most significant activities that impact the economic performance of these renewable
energy facilities were decisions associated with siting, negotiating purchase
power agreements, engineering, procurement and construction, and decisions
associated with ongoing operations and maintenance-related activities. Duke
Energy consolidated the entities as it makes all of these decisions.  

   NON-CONSOLIDATED VIEs    

  The tables below disclose VIEs the Duke
Energy Registrants do not consolidate and how these entities impact the Duke
Energy Registrants  respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

The
Duke Energy Registrants are not aware of any situations where the maximum
exposure to loss significantly exceeds the carrying values shown above except
for the power purchase agreement with the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation
(OVEC), which is discussed below, and various guarantees, reflected in the
table above as Deferred credits and other liabilities.

Combined Notes To

Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued)      

Until December 31,
2013, Duke Energy owned a 50 percent ownership interest in DukeNet. DukeNet was
considered a VIE because it has entered into certain contractual arrangements
that provide it with additional forms of subordinated financial support. The
most significant activities that impacted DukeNet s economic performance relate
to its business development and fiber optic capacity marketing and management
activities. The power to direct these activities was jointly and equally shared
by Duke Energy and the other joint venture partner.   

  On December 31, 2013, Duke Energy completed
the sale of its ownership interest in DukeNet to Time Warner Cable, Inc. For
more information on the sale of DukeNet, refer to Note 12.   

   Renewables   

  Duke Energy has investments in various
renewable energy project entities. Some of these entities are VIEs due to power
purchase agreements with terms that approximate the expected life of the
project. These fixed price agreements effectively transfer commodity price risk
to the buyer of the power. Duke Energy does not consolidate these VIEs because
power to direct and control key activities is shared jointly by Duke Energy and
other owners.   

   FPC Capital I Trust   

  At December 31, 2012, Progress Energy had
variable interests in the FPC Capital I Trust (the Trust). The Trust, a finance
subsidiary, was established for the sole purpose of issuing $300 million of
7.10% Cumulative QUIPS due 2039, and using the proceeds thereof to purchase
$300 million of 7.10% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Notes due 2039
from Florida Progress Funding Corporation (Funding Corp.). Funding Corp. was
formed for the sole purpose of providing financing to Duke Energy Florida. On February 1, 2013,
Duke Energy redeemed the QUIPS and subsequently terminated the Trust.  

   Other   

  The most significant of the Other
non-consolidated VIEs is Duke Energy Ohio s 9 percent ownership interest in
OVEC. Through its ownership interest in OVEC, Duke Energy Ohio has a contractual
arrangement to buy power from OVEC s power plants through June 2040. Proceeds
from the sale of power by OVEC to its power purchase agreement counterparties
are designed to be sufficient to meet its operating expenses, fixed costs, debt
amortization and, interest expense, as well as earn a return on equity.
Accordingly, the value of this contract is subject to variability due to
fluctuations in power prices and changes in OVEC s costs of business, including
costs associated with its 2,256 MW of coal-fired generation capacity. As discussed
in Note 5, proposed environmental rulemaking could increase the costs of OVEC,
which would be passed through to Duke Energy Ohio. The initial carrying value
of this contract was recorded as an intangible asset when Duke Energy acquired
Cinergy in April 2006. This amount is included in the table above for Duke
Energy and Duke Energy Ohio.   

  In addition, Duke Energy has guaranteed
performance of certain entities in which it no longer has an equity interest.  

   CRC   

  See
discussion under Consolidated VIEs for additional information related to CRC.  

  The subordinated notes held by Duke Energy
Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are stated at fair value and are classified within
Receivables in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. Carrying values of retained
interests are determined by allocating carrying value of the receivables
between assets sold and interests retained based on relative fair value. The
allocated basis of the subordinated notes are not materially different than
their face value because (i) the receivables generally turnover in less than
two months, (ii) credit losses are reasonably predictable due to the broad
customer base and lack of significant concentration, and (iii) the equity in
CRC is subordinate to all retained interests and thus would absorb losses
first. The hypothetical effect on fair value of the retained interests assuming
both a 10 percent and a 20 percent unfavorable variation in credit losses or
discount rates is not material due to the short turnover of receivables and
historically low credit loss history. Interest accrues to Duke Energy Ohio and
Duke Energy Indiana on the retained interests using the acceptable yield method.
This method generally approximates the stated rate on the notes since the
allocated basis and the face value are nearly equivalent. An impairment charge
is recorded against the carrying value of both retained interests and purchased
beneficial interest whenever it is determined that an other-than-temporary
impairment has occurred.

Cash flows from the
sale of receivables are reflected within Operating Activities on Duke Energy
Ohio s and Duke Energy Indiana s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   

  Collection fees
received in connection with the servicing of transferred accounts receivable
are included in Operation, maintenance and other on Duke Energy Ohio s and Duke
Energy Indiana s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income. The loss recognized on sales of receivables is calculated monthly by
multiplying the receivables sold during the month by the required discount. The
required discount is derived monthly utilizing a three-year weighted-average
formula that considers charge-off history, late charge history, and turnover
history on the sold receivables, as well as a component for the time value of
money. The discount rate, or component for the time value of money, is
calculated monthly by summing the prior month-end LIBOR plus a fixed rate of 1.00
percent.  

18. COMMON STOCK    

Basic
Earnings Per Share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income attributable to
Duke Energy common shareholders, adjusted for distributed and undistributed
earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by
dividing net income attributable to Duke Energy common shareholders, as
adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating
securities, by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur
if securities or other agreements to issue common stock, such as stock options,
phantom shares and stock-based performance unit awards were exercised or
settled. Duke Energy s participating securities are restricted stock units that
are entitled to dividends declared on Duke Energy common shares during the
restricted stock units  vesting period.   

  On July 2, 2012, just prior to the close of
the merger with Progress Energy, Duke Energy executed a one-for-three reverse
stock split. All earnings per share amounts included in this 10-K are presented
as if the one-for-three reverse stock split had been effective January 1, 2011.
The following table presents Duke Energy s basic and diluted EPS calculations

either the option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of
the common shares during those periods, or performance measures related to the

19. SEVERANCE    

2011
SEVERANCE PLAN   

In
conjunction with the merger with Progress Energy, in November 2011 Duke Energy
and Progress Energy offered a voluntary severance plan to certain eligible
employees. As this was a voluntary severance plan, all severance benefits
offered under this plan are considered special termination benefits under U.S.
GAAP. Special termination benefits are measured upon employee acceptance and
recorded immediately absent any significant retention period. If a significant
retention period exists, the cost of the special termination benefits are
recorded ratably over the retention period. Approximately 1,100 employees from
Duke Energy and Progress Energy requested severance

during
the voluntary window, which closed on November 30, 2011. The estimated amount
of future severance expense associated with this voluntary plan through 2014
are not material.   

  Additionally,
in the third quarter of 2012, a voluntary severance plan was offered to certain
unionized employees of Duke Energy Ohio. Approximately 75 employees accepted the
termination benefits during the voluntary window, which closed on October 8,
2012. The expense associated with this plan was not material.  

  In
conjunction with the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3, severance benefits have
been made available to certain eligible impacted unionized and non-unionized
employees, to the extent that those employees do not find job opportunities at
other locations. Approximately 600 employees worked at Crystal River Unit 3.
For the year ended December 31, 2013, Duke Energy Florida deferred $26 million
of severance costs as a regulatory asset. Severance costs expected to be
accrued over the remaining retention period for employees identified to have a
significant retention period is not material. However, these employees maintain
the ability to accept job opportunities at other Duke Energy locations, which
would result in severance not being paid. If a significant amount of these
individuals redeploy within Duke Energy, the final severance benefits paid under
the plan may be less than what has been accrued to date. Refer to Note 4 for
further discussion regarding Crystal River Unit 3.   

Amounts included in the table below represent direct and
  allocated severance and related expense recorded by the Duke Energy
  Registrants, and are recorded in Operation, maintenance and other within
  Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Duke
  Energy Registrants recorded insignificant amounts for severance expense
  during 2011 for past and ongoing severance plans.

20. STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION   

Duke
Energy s 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan) reserved 25 million
shares of common stock for awards to employees and outside directors. Duke
Energy has historically issued new shares upon exercising or vesting of
share-based awards. However, Duke Energy may use a combination of new share
issuances and open market repurchases for share-based awards that are exercised
or become vested in the future. Duke Energy has not determined with certainty
the amount of such new share issuances or open market repurchases.  

  The
2010 Plan allows for a maximum of 6.25 million shares of common stock to be
issued under various stock-based awards other than options and stock
appreciation rights.  

  In
connection with the acquisition of Progress Energy in July 2012, Duke Energy
assumed Progress Energy s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP). Stock-based awards
granted under the Progress Energy EIP and held by Progress Energy employees
were generally converted into outstanding Duke Energy stock-based compensation
awards. The estimated fair value of these awards allocated to purchase price was
$62 million. Refer to Note 2 for further information regarding the merger
transaction.  

  The following table summarizes the total
expense recognized by each of the Duke Energy Registrants, net of tax, for
stock-based compensation.

Pretax stock-based compensation costs, the tax
benefit associated with stock-based compensation expense, and stock-based compensation
costs capitalized are included in the following table.  

The
exercise price of each option granted cannot be less than the market price of
Duke Energy s common stock on the date of grant and the maximum option term is
10 years. The vesting periods range from immediate to three years. Options
granted in 2013 and 2012 were expensed immediately; therefore, there is no
future compensation cost associated with these options. The following table
includes information related to Duke Energy s stock options.

%  

(a)  

The risk-free rate is based upon the average of five-year and
  seven-year U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates as of the grant date.  

(b)  

The expected dividend yield is based upon the most recent
  annualized dividend and the one-year average closing stock price.  

(c)  

The expected life of options is derived from the simplified
  method approach.  

(d)  

Volatility is based equally between historical and implied
  volatility. Historic volatility is based on Duke Energy's historical
  volatility over the expected life using daily stock prices. Implied
  volatility is the average for all option contracts with a term greater than
  six months using the strike price closest to the stock price on the valuation
  date.

The total grant date
fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and
2011 was $50 million, $34 million and $19 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had $21 million of unrecognized compensation
cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1
year and 9 months.  

   PERFORMANCE AWARDS   

  Stock-based awards issued and outstanding
generally vest over three years if performance targets are met.   

  Certain performance awards granted in 2013,
2012 and 2011 contain market conditions based on the total shareholder return
(TSR) of Duke Energy stock relative to a pre-defined peer group (relative TSR).
These awards are valued using a path-dependent model that incorporates expected
relative TSR into the fair value determination of Duke Energy s
performance-based share awards. The model uses three-year historical
volatilities and correlations for all companies in the pre-defined peer group,
including Duke Energy, to simulate Duke Energy s relative TSR as of the end of
the performance period. For each simulation, Duke Energy s relative TSR
associated with the simulated stock price at the end of the performance period
plus expected dividends within the period results in a value per share for the
award portfolio. The average of these simulations is the expected portfolio
value per share. Actual life to date results of Duke Energy s relative TSR for
each grant is incorporated within the model.  

  Other performance awards not containing
market conditions were awarded in 2012 and 2011. The performance goal for these
awards is Duke Energy s return on equity over a three-year period. Awards are
measured at grant date price.  

  The following table includes information
related to performance awards.   

The total grant date
fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and
2011 was $42 million, $56 million and $33 million, respectively. At December
31, 2013, Duke Energy had $22 million of unrecognized compensation cost, which
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1 year and 11
months.  

21. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS   

DEFINED Benefit
Retirement Plans    

  Duke Energy maintains, and the Subsidiary
Registrants participate in, qualified, non-contributory defined benefit
retirement plans. The plans cover most U.S. employees using a cash balance
formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a
retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current
eligible earnings based on age and/or years of service and interest credits.
Certain employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings
formula. As of January 1, 2014, these defined benefit plans are closed to new
participants. Under these average earnings formulas, a plan participant
accumulates a retirement benefit equal to the sum of percentages of their (i)
highest three-year or four-year average earnings, (ii) highest three-year or
four-year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of
participation (maximum of 35 years), and/or (iii) highest three or four-year
average earnings times years of

participation in
excess of 35 years. Duke Energy also maintains, and the Subsidiary Registrants
participate in, non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement
plans which cover certain executives.  

  Duke Energy uses a December 31 measurement
date for its defined benefit retirement plan assets and obligations.   

  Net periodic benefit costs disclosed in the
tables below represent the cost of the respective benefit plan for the periods
presented. However, portions of the net periodic benefit costs disclosed in the
tables below have been capitalized as a component of property, plant and
equipment. Amounts presented in the tables below for the Subsidiary Registrants
represent the amounts of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost
allocated by Duke Energy for employees of the Subsidiary Registrants.
Additionally, the Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate
share of pension and post-retirement benefit cost for employees of Duke
Energy s shared services affiliate that provide support to the Subsidiary
Registrants. These allocated amounts are included in the governance and shared
service costs discussed in Note 13.  

  Duke Energy s policy is to fund amounts on an
actuarial basis to provide assets sufficient to meet benefit payments to be
paid to plan participants. The following table includes information related to
the Duke Energy Registrants  contributions to its U.S. qualified defined
benefit pension plans.

Assumptions Used for Pension Benefits
Accounting   

  The discount rate used to determine the
current year pension obligation and following year s pension expense is based
on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a
discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that
generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the
plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable
corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is
selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value
of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the
market value of the bonds selected.  

  The average remaining service period of
active covered employees is nine years for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas,
Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana and eight years for Progress Energy,
Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida.  

  The following tables present the assumptions
used for pension benefit accounting. For Progress Energy plans, the assumptions
used in 2012 to determine net periodic pension cost reflect remeasurement as of
July 1, 2012, due to the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy.

Other
Post-Retirement Benefit Plans    

  Duke Energy provides,
and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, some health care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non-contributory
basis. Employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and
service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans. The health care
benefits include medical, dental, and prescription drug coverage and are
subject to certain limitations, such as deductibles and co-payments.   

  Duke Energy did not

Assumptions Used for Other Post-Retirement
Benefits Accounting   

  The discount rate used to determine the
current year other post-retirement benefits obligation and following year s
other post-retirement benefits expense is based on a bond selection-settlement
portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a
portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to

is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or

discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.  

  The following tables present the assumptions
used for other post-retirement benefits accounting. For Progress Energy plans,

benefit cost reflect remeasurement as of July 1, 2012, due to the merger
between Duke Energy and Progress Energy.

Plan Assets    

   Description
and Allocations   

    Duke Energy Master
Retirement Trust    

  Assets for both the
qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits are maintained in the Duke
Energy Master Retirement Trust. Approximately 98 percent of the Duke Energy Master
Retirement Trust assets were allocated to qualified pension plans and
approximately 2 percent were allocated to other post-retirement plans, as of December
31, 2013 and 2012. The investment objective of the Duke Energy Master
Retirement Trust is to achieve reasonable returns, subject to a prudent level
of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for
plan participants.   

  The asset allocation
targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk
profile. Equity securities are held for their high expected return. Debt
securities, hedge funds, real estate and other global securities are held for
diversification. Investments within asset classes are to be diversified to
achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers
or investments. Duke Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and
periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocation when
considered appropriate.   

  Qualified pension and
other post-retirement benefits for the Subsidiary Registrants are derived from
the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust, as such, each are allocated their
proportionate share of the assets discussed below.   

  The following table
includes the target asset allocations by asset class at December 31, 2013 and
the actual asset allocations for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust.

Trust at December 31, 2012.  

VEBA I   

  Duke Energy also invests other
post-retirement assets in the Duke Energy Corporation Employee Benefits Trust
(VEBA I). The investment objective of VEBA I is to achieve sufficient returns,
subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the
security of plan benefits for participants. VEBA I is passively managed  .   

  The following table includes the weighted-average
returns expected by asset classes and the target asset allocations at December

Fair Value
Measurements   

  Duke Energy classifies
recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements based on the fair value
hierarchy as discussed in Note 16.  

  Valuation methods of
the primary fair value measurements disclosed above are as follows:   

    Investments
in equity securities    

  Investments
in equity securities, other than those accounted for as equity and cost method
investments, are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active
market as of the last business day of the reporting period. Principal active
markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE.
Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the
currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market.
Prices have not been adjusted to reflect after-hours market activity. The
majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1
measurements. When (i) the Duke Energy Registrants lack the ability to redeem
investments valued on a net asset value per share basis at net asset value per
share in the near future or (ii) net asset value per share is not available at
the measurement date, the fair value measurement of the investment is
categorized as Level 3.   

    Investments in debt
securities    

  Most debt investments
are valued based on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads
applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate)
and consider the counterparty credit rating. Most debt valuations are Level 2
measurements. If the market for a particular fixed income security is
relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3. U.S. Treasury debt
is typically Level 1.  

    Investments in
short-term investment funds    

  Investments in
short-term investment funds are valued at the net asset value of units held at year
end. Investments in short-term investment funds with published prices are
valued as Level 1. Investments in short-term investment funds with unpublished
prices are valued as Level 2.   

    Investments in real
estate investment trusts    

  Investments in real
estate investment trusts are valued based upon property appraisal reports prepared by
independent real estate appraisers. The Chief Real Estate Appraiser of the
asset manager is responsible for assuring that the valuation process provides
independent and reasonable property market value estimates. An external
appraisal management firm not affiliated with the asset manager has been
appointed to assist the Chief Real Estate Appraiser in maintaining and
monitoring the independence and the accuracy of the appraisal process.

Employee Savings Plans    

  Duke Energy sponsors,
and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, employee savings plans that
cover substantially all U.S. employees. Most employees participate in a
matching contribution formula where Duke Energy provides a matching
contribution generally equal to 100 percent of employee before-tax and Roth
401(k) contributions, and, as applicable, after-tax contributions, of up to 6
percent of eligible pay per pay period. Dividends on Duke Energy shares held by
the savings plans are charged to retained earnings when declared and shares
held in the plans are considered outstanding in the calculation of basic and
diluted earnings per share.

Valuation
allowances have been established for certain foreign and state NOL

an amount that will be realized on a more-likely-than-not basis. The net change
in the total valuation allowance is included in Tax differential on foreign
earnings and State income tax, net of federal income tax effect in the above

On
July 23, 2013, HB 998 was signed into law. HB 998 reduces the North Carolina
corporate income tax rate from a statutory 6.9 percent to 6.0 percent in
January 2014 with a further reduction to 5.0 percent in January 2015. Duke
Energy recorded a net reduction of approximately $145 million to its North
Carolina deferred tax liability in the third quarter of 2013. The significant
majority of this deferred tax liability reduction was offset by recording a
regulatory liability pending NCUC determination of the disposition of the amounts
related to Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The impact of HB 998
did not have a significant impact on the financial position, results of
operation, or cash flows of Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy
or Duke Energy Progress.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

  Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants
in the reports they file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time
periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC) rules and
forms.  

  Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  

  Under the
supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have
evaluated their effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as
of December 31, 2013, and, based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls and
procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance of compliance.  

   Changes in
Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

  Under the
supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have
evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred
during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013 and have concluded no change
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal
control over financial reporting.  

   Management s
Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

  The Duke
Energy Registrants  management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f). The Duke
Energy Registrants  internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and
procedures may deteriorate.  

  The Duke
Energy Registrants  management, including their Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
their internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based
on the framework in the 1992 Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
that evaluation, management concluded that its internal controls over financial
reporting were effective as of December 31, 2013.   

  Deloitte  
Touche LLP, Duke Energy s independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Duke Energy s internal
control over financial reporting  .

To safeguard the continued independence of
the independent auditor, the Duke Energy Audit Committee adopted a policy that
provides the independent public accountants are only permitted to provide
services to Duke Energy and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the
Subsidiary Registrants that have been pre-approved by the Duke Energy Audit
Committee. Pursuant to the policy, detailed audit services, audit-related
services, tax services and certain other services have been specifically
pre-approved up to certain fee limits. In the event the cost of any of these
services may exceed the pre-approved limits, the Duke Energy Audit Committee
must pre-approve the service. All other services that are not prohibited
pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission s or other applicable
regulatory bodies  rules of regulations must be specifically pre-approved by
the Duke Energy Audit Committee. All services performed in in 2013 and 2012 by
the independent public accountant were approved by the Duke Energy Audit Committee
and Legacy Progress Energy Audit Committee pursuant to their pre-approval
policies.

the Plan effective as of January 1, 2014.  The purpose of the Plan is to
provide deferred compensation for the Nonemployee Directors of the Board.  This

specify whether a Participant who provides services to the purchaser
immediately after the transaction has incurred a Separation from Service.  With
respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals, the term  Separation from Service  shall mean a
termination of service on the Board or otherwise within the meaning of the Plan
or applicable Prior Plan as in effect immediately prior to October 3, 2004.

Nonemployee Directors participating in the Plan immediately prior to January 1,
2014 will continue to participate in the Plan on and after January 1, 2014. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3.1 to the contrary, any
individual with respect to whom amounts have been assumed from Prior Plans as
described in Section 4.1 shall automatically participate, and be a
 Participant,  in the Plan with respect to such amounts.  An individual s right
to defer shall cease with respect to the Plan Year following the Plan Year in
which he or she ceases to be eligible to participate in the Plan, although such
individual shall continue to be subject to all of the terms and conditions of
the Plan for as long as he or she remains a Participant.    

  3.2              Deferral Elections  
Compensation   .  Any individual who on or after January 1, 2014 becomes a
Nonemployee Director will become a Participant in the Plan upon beginning to
serve as a member of the Board of Directors.  Each eligible Participant may
irrevocably elect to defer in accordance with the terms of this Plan, a
percentage up to 100% (such percentage to be a multiple of 1%) of such
Participant s Compensation for each Plan Year.  Unless an earlier date is
specified by the Committee, such election must be made by the Participant not
later than the beginning of such Plan Year or within 30 days of a Participant
initially becoming eligible to participate in the Plan (or any other plan
required to be aggregated with the Plan under Section 409A of the Code).  In
the event that a Participant first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan
other than on the first day of a Plan Year, he or she shall have no right to
defer Compensation prior to the date that is 30 days after he or she initially
becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, and his or her deferral election
shall apply only to Compensation earned beginning 30 days after he or she
initially becomes eligible to participate in the Plan.  Compensation deferred
shall be credited to the Participant s Account at the time such Compensation
otherwise would be paid to the Participant.  Unless otherwise specified by the
Committee in accordance with procedures established from time to time, an
election to defer Compensation shall apply only with respect to the
Compensation earned in the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the
deferral election is made, and such deferral election cannot be revoked.  

  3.3              Deferral Elections - LTIP
Awards   .  Each eligible Participant may irrevocably elect to defer, in
accordance with the terms of this Plan, the entire amount of any LTIP Award,
subject to the following conditions:  

  (a)              General
Rule   .  Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the deferral election
shall be made by, and shall become irrevocable as of, December 31 (or such
earlier date as specified by the Committee) of the Plan Year next preceding the
Plan Year for which such LTIP Award is granted.  In the event that a
Participant first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan other than on the
first day of a Plan Year but after the commencement of a performance period, he
or she shall have the right to make a deferral election in accordance with
procedures established from time to time by the Committee within 30 days after
initially becoming eligible to participate but the deferral election shall only
apply to that portion of the LTIP Award that is earned for such performance
period equal to the total amount of the LTIP Award earned during such
performance period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days beginning on the day immediately after the date that is 30 days
after the Participant initially becomes eligible to participate and ending on
the last day of the performance period, and the denominator of which is the
total number of days in the performance period.  

  (b)              Compensation
Subject to Vesting   .   To the extent permitted by the Committee, and
notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary, the
deferral election with respect to an LTIP Award that is subject to a forfeiture
condition requiring the Participant s continued services for a period of at
least 12 months from the date that the Participant obtains a  legally binding
right  to such compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code)
must be made by, and shall become irrevocable as of, the thirtieth day
following the date that the Participant obtains the legally binding right to
such compensation, provided that the election is made at least twelve months in
advance of the earliest date at which the forfeiture condition could lapse. 
For this purpose, a condition will not be treated as failing to require the
Participant to continue to provide services for a period of at least 12 months
merely because the condition immediately lapses upon the death or disability
(as defined in Section 409A of the Code) of the Participant, or upon a change
in control (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), provided that if such
death, disability, or change in control occurs and the condition lapses before
the end of such 12-month period, the deferral election made under this Section
3.3(b) shall not apply to such compensation.  

  (c)              Performance-Based
Compensation   .  To the extent permitted by the Committee, and
notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary, the
deferral election with respect to an LTIP Award that constitutes
Performance-Based Compensation must be made by, and shall become irrevocable as
of, the date that is six months before the end of the applicable performance
period (or such earlier date as specified by the Committee on the deferral
election), provided that in no event may such deferral election be made after
such LTIP Award has become  readily ascertainable  within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code.  In order to make a deferral election under this
Section 3.3(c), the Participant must perform services continuously from the later
of the beginning of the performance period or the date the performance criteria
are established through the date a deferral election becomes irrevocable under
this Section 3.3(c).  An election made under this Section shall not apply to
any portion of the Performance-Based Compensation that is actually earned by a
Participant regardless of satisfaction of the performance criteria.  

  (d)              Crediting
Date   .  Upon the date that an LTIP Award that the Participant has elected to
defer otherwise would have been payable, the number of shares of stock or the
cash payment that would have become so payable but for the deferral election
shall be credited to the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount.  

  (e)              Dividend
Equivalents   .  Dividend equivalents, to the extent deferred, shall also be
deferred and credited to the Participant s Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock
Deferrals Subaccount commencing on the payment date of the first cash dividend
of the Company s common stock that is declared after the date on which the
deferred LTIP Award vests.  

   ARTICLE IV 
ACCOUNTS AND PRIOR PLANS   

4.1              Prior
Plans   .  As described in more detail in Appendix A, the Plan governs the
terms and conditions of all or a portion of the amounts previously earned under
the following plans (each a  Prior Plan ):  (a) the Cinergy Corp. Directors 
Deferred Compensation Plan; (b) LTIP Awards previously deferred through
freestanding deferral agreements (and not yet distributed) by Participants who
previously were on the Board of Directors of Cinergy Corp.; (c) the Progress
Energy, Inc. Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan; and (d) the
Progress Energy, Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Unit Plan.  Amounts that were
previously payable under the Prior Plans and that have been credited to Accounts
hereunder shall remain subject to the same vesting schedule and elections
(including deferral and distribution elections) and beneficiary designations
that were controlling under the applicable Prior Plan immediately prior to the
date such amounts were credited to Accounts under the Plan until a new election
is made in accordance with the terms of this Plan that by its terms supersedes
the prior election.  This Plan shall recognize any amount that was properly
deferred by a Participant under a Prior Plan but that had not yet been credited
to his or her account thereunder as of the date the obligations under such plan
were assumed by this Plan.  Each Participant s right to receive any benefit
that has been transferred to this Plan shall be determined solely pursuant to
the terms of this Plan.  All of the Company s obligations and Participants 
rights with respect to the amounts previously payable under the Prior Plan
shall automatically be extinguished and become obligations and rights under
this Plan without further action as of the applicable effective date set forth
on Appendix A.  

  4.2              Application of Code Section
409A to Prior Plans   .   

  (a)              Pre-2005
Deferrals   .  Any  amounts deferred  in taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2005 under the Plan or Prior Plan, within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code, and any earnings thereon ( Pre-2005 Deferrals ), shall be
governed by the terms of the Plan or Prior Plan, as applicable, as in effect on
October 3, 2004, and it is intended that such amounts and any earnings thereon
be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code.  Nothing contained
herein is intended to materially enhance a benefit or right existing under the
Plan or Prior Plan as of October 3, 2004 or add a new material benefit or right
to such Plan or Prior Plan.  

  (b)              Post-2004
Deferrals   .  Any  amounts deferred  in taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2005 under the Plan or Prior Plan, within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code, and any earnings thereon ( Post-2004 Deferrals ), shall be
governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan.  

  4.3              Maintenance of Participant
Accounts   .  An Account shall be established and maintained with respect to
each Participant.  Each Account shall reflect the amounts credited thereto
pursuant to Article IV, plus or minus adjustments made in accordance with the
provisions of Article IV and reduced by distributions made in accordance with
Article VI.  

  4.4              Phantom Investment Options   . 
In accordance with such rules as the Committee shall approve, Investment
Options shall be available hereunder that generally correspond with each RSP
investment option and such other investment options as are determined to be
appropriate by the Committee.  Each Participant hereunder shall specify, in
accordance with this Section and rules established by the Committee, the
 investment  of his or her Account in one or more Investment Options hereunder,
and may elect to transfer his or her Account among such Investment Options. 
The Participant s Account shall thereafter be automatically adjusted daily (or
on such other basis as the Committee shall approve), upward or downward, in
proportion to the total percentage return experienced for the respective period
on amounts invested in the Investment Options.  Accounts under the Plan shall
be bookkeeping accounts reflecting units of phantom Investment Options
hereunder which mirror the performance that would have resulted from an actual
investment in the corresponding Investment Option(s).  No amounts actually
shall be invested hereunder in any Investment Option.  The Plan s investment
option that corresponds to the RSP s Duke Energy Common Stock Fund shall be
referred to as the  Duke Energy Common Stock Fund .  Effective as of January 1,
2014, the portion (if any) of each Participant s Account that was credited to
the Spectra Common Stock Fund was automatically reallocated to the U.S. Equity
S P 500 Index Fund Investment Option, and the Spectra Common Stock Fund is
no longer available as an Investment Option under the Plan.    

  4.5              Duke Energy Common Stock -
Stock Deferrals Subaccount   .   Amounts credited to a Participant s Account
pursuant to Section 3.3, and amounts credited to a Participant s Account
pursuant to certain transfers from Prior Plans as provided under Section 4.1
and Appendix A, shall be held in a subaccount within such Participant s Account
(the  Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount ).  The amounts in
the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount shall be credited and
maintained as units of a share-based phantom investment that mirrors the
performance of the Company s common stock (with cash dividends reinvested). 
Participants may not elect to transfer amounts into or out of the Duke Energy
Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount.  

  4.6              Duke Energy Common Stock  
Merged Plans Subaccount   .  Amounts credited to a Participant s Account
pursuant to certain transfers from Prior Plans as provided under Section 4.1
and Appendix A, shall be held in a subaccount within such Participant s Account
(the  Duke Energy Common Stock - Merged Plans Subaccount ).  The amounts in the
Duke Energy Common Stock - Merged Plans Subaccount shall be credited and
maintained as units of a share-based phantom investment that mirrors the
performance of the Company s common stock (with cash dividends reinvested). 
Participants may not elect to transfer amounts into or out of the Duke Energy
Common Stock - Merged Plans Subaccount.  

  4.7              Adjustments to Stock Funds   . 
If there shall occur any merger, consolidation, liquidation, issuance of rights
or warrants to purchase securities, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, spin-off, split-off, stock split, reverse stock split or other
distribution with respect to the shares of the Company, or any similar
corporate transaction or event in respect of such shares, then the Committee
shall, in the manner and to the extent that it deems appropriate and equitable
to the Participants and consistent with the terms of this Plan, cause a
proportionate adjustment to be made in number and kind of shares deemed held
under the Plan in the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund, the Duke Energy Common
Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount, and the Duke Energy Common Stock - Merged
Plans Subaccount.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the
Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for any or all
outstanding shares under the Plan such alternative consideration as it, in good
faith, may determine to be equitable under the circumstances.  

  4.8              Fixed Interest Subaccount   . 
The portion of a Participant s Account that, as of December 31, 2000, was
maintained as a Fixed Interest Subaccount, shall be transferred, on January 1,
2001, to a special fixed interest investment option, where it shall continue to
be credited with interest in the same manner and at the rates that would have
been applicable under the Fixed Interest Subaccount had the Fixed Interest
Subaccount continued.  On and after January 1, 2001, the Participant (or, if
the Participant is dead, the Participant s beneficiary) may elect to transfer
amounts from the fixed interest investment option to any open investment
option, but the fixed interest investment option shall be closed to additional
deferrals and to transfer from any other investment option.  

   ARTICLE V 
VESTING   

5.1              General
Rule   .  A Participant is 100% vested in his or her Account.  

   ARTICLE VI 
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS   

  6.1              Commencement Date   . 
Except as otherwise provided below, following Separation from Service, a
Participant will receive, or will begin to receive, payment of his or her
benefits under this Plan, which consist of the portion of his or her Account
that is vested, as determined under Article V.  Each Participant who served on
the Board of Directors on January 1, 2001, who made an irrevocable election
under this Plan prior to such date, and who continuously served on the Board of
Directors through attainment of age 62, shall not commence to receive his or
her payment of his or her benefits under the Plan until attainment of age 70 or
his or her earlier death.  

  6.2              Election of Distribution
Option   .   

  (a)              Pre-2005
Deferrals   .  Each Participant under the Plan or a Legacy Cinergy Plan has been
provided the opportunity with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals to elect from among
the distribution options specified in Section 6.3 the manner in which such
Participant s Account shall be paid following Separation from Service.  A
Participant may elect to change the distribution option for such Pre-2005
Deferrals, other than any such amounts attributable to the Legacy Cinergy
Plans, to a distribution option permitted under Section 6.3 once in any 12
month period, but any such change shall become effective one year from the date
on which the election form was submitted to the Committee, but only if the
Participant remains on the Board of Directors throughout such one year period. 
Failure to timely elect a distribution option with respect to those Pre-2005
Deferrals shall result in a deemed election of five annual installments with
respect to such amounts.  Each Participant under the Legacy Progress Plans has
been provided the opportunity with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals to elect from
among the distribution options specified in Section 6.3(e) the manner in which
such Participant s Account shall be paid following Separation from Service.  A
Participant may elect to change the distribution option for such Pre-2005
Deferrals to a distribution option permitted under Section 6.3(e), so long as
the change is made at least six months prior to the payment date.    

  (b)              Post-2004
Deferrals   .  With respect to each amount deferred under the Plan after 2007,
each Participant shall, in accordance with procedures established from time to
time by the Committee and no later than the last day for filing the deferral
election to which such deferrals relate, be entitled to make a separate
class-year election from among the distribution options specified in Section
6.4.  With respect to all amounts deferred under the Plan after 2004 and before
2008, each Participant has been provided, in accordance with procedures
established from time to time by the Committee consistent with Section 6.6, the
opportunity to make a single election (which may be separate for deferrals of
LTIP Award and deferrals of other Compensation) from among the distribution
options specified in Section 6.4.  A Participant may not elect to change such
elections.  Failure to timely elect a distribution option with respect to
Post-2004 Deferrals shall result in a deemed election of payment in a single
lump sum. With respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, each Participant under the
Legacy Progress Plans has been provided the opportunity to make a separate
class-year election from among the distribution options specified in Section
6.4(d) the manner in which such Participant s Account shall be paid following
Separation from Service.  A Participant may not elect to change such elections.  

  6.3              Distribution Options for
Pre-2005 Deferrals   .  Subject to the foregoing, the following distribution
options are available with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals:  

  (a)              Lump

the month in which occurs the Separation from Service occurs.  

  (b)              Term
Payments   .  Payment of the full amount of the Participant s Account in

installment shall be determined by dividing the Account balance by the number
of installments then remaining to obtain the cash amount and/or number of whole
shares of Company common stock, including the cash amount for any fractional
share, to be paid in the current installment.  An annual installment shall be
paid as promptly as administratively feasible after the cash amount and number
of whole shares of Company common stock, including the cash amount for any
fractional share, are to be included in the installment have been determined.  

  (c)              Discretion
to Change Distribution Option   .  The Board of Directors may, in its sole
discretion, shorten or lengthen the time period over which a benefit is to be
paid or to provide for periodic payment of a benefit that otherwise would be
paid in lump sum or for lump sum payment of a benefit that otherwise would be
paid periodically.  

  (d)              Legacy
Cinergy Plans   .  Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a), 6.3(b) and 6.3(c), Pre-2005

distribution election, in a single lump sum payment or in a series of annual
installments (not to exceed 10) commencing during the 60-day period following
the first business day of the calendar year following the year in which the
Participant s service as a member of the Board terminates for any reason, and
(ii) to the Progress Energy, Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Unit Plan shall
be paid, in accordance with a valid distribution election, in a single lump sum
payment or in a series of annual installments over 5, 10 or 15 years commencing
during the 60-day period following the later of (x) the date the Participant is
no longer a member of the Board, or (y) the date such Participant attains age
65.     

  6.4              Distribution Options for
Post-2004 Deferrals   .  Subject to the foregoing, the following distribution
options are available with respect to Post-2004 Deferrals.

Separation from Service occurs.  

(b)              Term
Payments   .  Payment of the full amount of the Participant s Account in
annual installments over a period from two to ten, or fifteen, years.  The
amount to be distributed in each installment shall be determined by dividing

cash amount for any fractional share, to be paid in the current installment. 
Annual installments shall be paid on the first business day of the month
following the month in which the Participant s Separation from Service occurs
and on each applicable anniversary thereafter.  

  (c)              Default
Distribution Option   .  To the extent that a Participant does not designate
the distribution option of an amount deferred or contributed to his or her
Account, such amount (adjusted for earnings and losses) shall be distributed in
a single lump sum during the 60-day period following the date on which the
Participant s Separation from Service occurs.  

  (d)              Legacy
Progress Plans   .  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section,
Post-2004 Deferrals attributable (i) to the Progress Energy, Inc. Non-Employee
Director Deferred Compensation Plan shall be paid, in accordance with a valid

the date such Participant attains age 65.     

  6.5              Form of Payment   .  All
amounts due under the Plan shall be paid in cash, except that units in the Duke
Energy Common Stock Fund and the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals
Subaccount shall be converted to whole shares of Company common stock and cash
for any fractional share.  To the extent that the delivery of any shares of
Company common stock to a Participant under this Plan otherwise would cause all
or any portion of the Plan to be considered an  equity compensation plan  as
such term is defined in Section 303A(8) of the New York Stock Exchange Listed
Company Manual or any successor rule ( Listed Company Manual ), then such
shares shall be paid from, and shall count against the share reserve of, a
Company-sponsored  equity compensation plan  designated by the Committee that
complies with the shareholder approval requirements contained in the Listed
Company Manual.    

  6.6              Transition Relief for
Payment Elections   Post-2004 Deferrals   .  With respect to Post-2004
Deferrals, Participants designated by the Committee were provided the
opportunity, no later than a date specified by the Committee (provided that
such date occurs no later than December 31, 2008 or such other date as
permitted under Section 409A of the Code), to elect on a form provided by the
Committee to (a) change the date of payment of Subaccounts to a date otherwise
permitted for that Subaccount under the Plan; (b) change the form of payment of
Subaccounts to a form of payment otherwise permitted for that Subaccount under
the Plan; or (c) receive payment of all or a designated portion of one or more
Subaccounts in a single lump sum on a date in 2009 designated by the
Committee.  The Committee may also take any action that it deems necessary, in
its sole discretion, to amend prior deferral elections or payment elections of
a Participant, without the Participant s consent, to conform such elections to
the terms of this Plan.  This Section is intended to comply with Notice
2007-86, any subsequent notice or guidance, and the applicable proposed and
final Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code and shall be
interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.  

  6.7              Mandatory Six-Month Delay  
Post-2004 Deferrals   .  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.8, in no
event may payments of Post-2004 Deferrals commence, with respect to any
Participant who is a Specified Employee as of his or her Separation from
Service, prior to the first business day of the seventh month following such
Separation from Service (or if earlier, upon the Participant s death) if such
amounts are otherwise payable pursuant to the Participant s Separation from
Service.  Any amount that is postponed as a result of the prior sentence shall
be accumulated through and paid on the first business day of the seventh month
following such Separation from Service (or if earlier, upon the Participant s
death).  

  6.8              Discretionary Acceleration
of Payment   .  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the time
or schedule of a payment of Post-2004 Deferrals under the Plan to a time or
form otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code in accordance with the
requirements, restrictions and limitations of Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-3(j) (   e.g.   , relating to domestic relations orders, employment
taxes, conflict of interests, income inclusion under Section 409A of the Code,
state, local or foreign taxes, offsets, bona fide disputes and small accounts);
provided that in no event may a payment be accelerated following a Specified
Employee's Separation from Service to a date that is prior to the first
business day of the seventh month following that Participant's Separation from
Service (or if earlier, upon the Participant's death) unless specifically
permitted under Section 409A of the Code (   e.g.   , relating to domestic
relations orders, employment taxes and conflict of interests). Except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Plan, the Committee may not accelerate
the time or schedule of any payment or amount scheduled to be paid under the
Plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  

  6.9              Discretionary Delay of
Payments   .  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, delay the time or
form of payment of Post-2004 Deferrals under the Plan to a time or form
otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code in accordance with the
requirements, restrictions and limitations of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(7)
(   e.g.   , relating to compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code, federal
securities laws or other applicable laws); provided that the Committee treats
all payments to similarly situated Participants on a reasonably consistent
basis.  

  6.10            Actual Date of Payment   . 
If calculation of the amount of the payment is not administratively practicable
due to events beyond the control of the Participant (or beneficiary), the
payment will be treated as made upon the date specified under the Plan if the
payment is made during the first calendar year in which the calculation of the
amount of the payment is administratively practicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, payment must be made no later than the latest possible date
permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Moreover, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Plan to the contrary except Section 6.7, and to the extent
permitted by Section 409A of the Code, a payment will be treated as made upon
the date specified under the Plan if the payment is made as close as
administratively practicable to the relevant payment date specified herein, and
in any event within the same calendar year.  

  6.11            Unforeseeable Emergency for
Amounts Attributable to the Progress Energy, Inc. Non-Employee Director
Deferred Compensation Plan   .  In the event a Participant incurs a financial
hardship as a result of an  unforeseeable emergency , the Participant may apply
to the Committee for the distribution of all or a portion of the Participant s
Account attributable to amounts deferred, if any, under the Progress Energy,
Inc. Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan. The Committee, in the
exercise of its sole and absolute discretion, may approve or deny the request
in whole or in part.  The term  unforeseeable emergency  shall mean a severe
financial hardship to the Participant resulting from an illness or accident of
the Participant, the Participant s spouse, or a dependent (as defined in
Section 152(a) of the Code) of the Participant, loss of the Participant s
property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable
circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the
Participant.  In no event may the amounts distributed with respect to an
unforeseeable emergency exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such emergency
plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the
distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or
may be      

relieved through reimbursement, cancellation of
deferrals for the remainder of the Plan Year, or compensation by insurance or
otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant s assets (to the extent the
liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). 
If a Participant receives a distribution from the Plan pursuant to this Section
6.11, any deferral election in effect for the Participant under this Plan shall
be cancelled.  Any payment made pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall comply with
Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(vi) of the Code and the regulations (or similar guidance)
promulgated thereunder (or under any successor provisions).   

   ARTICLE VII 
DEATH BENEFITS   

  7.1              Designation of Beneficiary   . 
If a Participant dies while still having a vested Account balance under the
Plan, the vested unpaid balance shall be payable to the Participant s
beneficiary or beneficiaries as a death benefit.  The Company will provide each
Participant with a form whereby the Participant may designate a beneficiary or
beneficiaries by filing the completed form with the Company before the
Participant s death.  If a deceased Participant did not designate a
beneficiary, or if the designated beneficiary should predecease the
Participant, the Account shall be paid to the estate of the Participant.  

  7.2              Form of Payment   .  If a
Participant (or a beneficiary previously designated by a deceased Participant)
dies before receiving all amounts payable hereunder, then the remaining amounts
payable shall be paid to the specified beneficiary of such deceased person in
accordance with the distribution option in effect; provided, however, that if
such deceased person has failed to specify a surviving beneficiary, then all
Pre-2005 Deferrals attributable to the Plan or any Legacy Cinergy Plan shall be
paid to the deceased Participant s or beneficiary s estate in lump sum.  

  7.3              Legacy Progress Plans   .     

  (a)              Progress Energy, Inc.
Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan   .  Notwithstanding Section
7.2, amounts credited to a Participant s Account and attributable to the

  (b)              Progress Energy, Inc.

amounts credited to a Participant s Account and attributable to the Progress
Energy, Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Unit Plan shall be subject to the
following distribution rules in the event of the death of a Participant:  (i)
if the Participant's death occurs prior to the commencement of payment, payment
shall commence during the 60-day period following the date of the Participant's
death, and if the Participant has elected installment payments, the remaining
annual installments will be made on the anniversary of the first payment date,
and (ii) if the Participant's death occurs after payment has commenced, the
remaining balance of such Account will continue to be paid in accordance with
the existing payment schedule.   

   ARTICLE VIII 
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION   

  8.1              General Rule   .  The Board
of Directors or its delegate may (a) terminate the Plan with respect to future
Participants or future benefit accruals for current Participants; and (b) amend
the Plan in any respect, at any time.  No such termination or amendment may
reduce the amount of any then accrued benefit of any Participant and any
attempt to do so shall be void.  Subject to Section 6.7 hereof, the Committee
may, in its sole discretion to the extent permitted in Section 409A of the Code,
provide for the acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment of Post-2004
Deferrals under the Plan upon the termination of the Plan.  

   ARTICLE IX 
ADMINISTRATION   

  9.1           The Committee is the named
fiduciary of the Plan and as such shall have the authority to control and
manage the operation and administration of the Plan except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Plan document.  The named fiduciary may designate
persons other than the named fiduciary to carry out fiduciary responsibilities
under the Plan.  Any such allocation or designation must be in writing and must
be accepted in writing by any such other person.  

  9.2           The Committee is the
administrator of the Plan.  As administrator, the Committee has the authority
(without limitation as to other authority) to delegate its duties to agents and
to make rules and regulations that it believes are necessary or appropriate to
carry out the Plan.  The Committee has the discretion as a Plan fiduciary (i)
to interpret and construe the terms and provisions of the Plan (including any
rules or regulations adopted under the Plan), (ii) to determine questions of
eligibility to participate in the Plan and (iii) to make factual determinations
in connection with any of the foregoing.  A decision of the Committee with respect
to any matter pertaining to the Plan including without limitation the
individuals determined to be Participants, the benefits payable, and the
construction or interpretation of any provision thereof, shall be conclusive
and binding upon all interested persons.  No Committee member shall participate
in any decision of the Committee that would directly and specifically affect
the timing or amount of his or her benefits under the Plan, except to the
extent that such decision applies to all Participants under the Plan.  

   ARTICLE X 
CLAIMS PROCEDURE   

  10.1         A person with an interest in the
Plan shall have the right to file a claim for benefits under the Plan and to
appeal any denial of a claim for benefits.  Any request for a Plan benefit or
to clarify the claimant s rights to future benefits under the terms of the Plan
shall be considered to be a claim.  

  10.2         A claim for benefits will be
considered as having been made when submitted in writing by the claimant (or by
such claimant s authorized representative) to the Committee.  No particular
form is required for the claim, but the written claim must identify the name of
the claimant and describe generally the benefit to which the claimant believes
he or she is entitled.  The claim may be delivered personally during business
hours or mailed to the Committee.  

  10.3         The Committee will determine
whether, or to what extent, the claim may be allowed or denied under the terms
of the Plan.  If the claim is wholly or partially denied, the claimant shall be
so informed by written notice 90 days after the day the claim is submitted
unless special      

circumstances require an extension of
time for processing the claim.  If such an extension of time for processing is
required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant
prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period.  The extension notice
shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the
date by which the Plan expects to render the final decision.  If notice of
denial of a claim (in whole or in part) is not furnished within the initial
90-day period after the claim is submitted (or, if applicable, the extended
90-day period), the claimant shall consider that his or her claim has been
denied just as if he or she had received actual notice of denial.  

  10.4         The notice informing the
claimant that his claim has been wholly or partially denied shall be written in
a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include:  

  (a)           The
specific reason(s) for the denial.  

  (b)           Specific
reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based.  

  (c)           A
description of any additional material or information necessary for the
claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or
information is necessary.  

  (d)           Appropriate
information as to the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to submit his or
her claim for review.  

  10.5         If the claim is wholly or
partially denied, the claimant (or his or her authorized representative) may
file an appeal of the denied claim with the Committee requesting that the claim
be reviewed.  The Committee shall conduct a full and fair review of each
appealed claim and its denial.  Unless the Committee notifies the claimant that
due to the nature of the benefit and other attendant circumstances he or she is
entitled to a greater period of time within which to submit his or her request
for review of a denied claim, the claimant shall have 60 days after he or she
(or his or her authorized representative) receives written notice of denial of
his or her claim within which such request must be submitted to the Committee.  

  10.6         The request for review of a
denied claim must be made in writing.  In connection with making such request,
the claimant or his or her authorized representative may:  

  (a)           Review
pertinent documents.  

  (b)           Submit
issues and comments in writing.  

  10.7         The decision of the Committee
regarding the appeal shall be promptly given to the claimant in writing and
shall normally be given no later than 60 days following the receipt of the
request for review.  However, if special circumstances (for example, if the
Committee decides to hold a hearing on the appeal) require a further extension
of time for processing, the decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but
no later than 120 days after receipt of the request for review.  However, if
the Committee holds regularly scheduled meetings at least quarterly, a decision
on review shall be made by no later than the date of the meeting which
immediately follows the Plan s receipt of a request for review, unless the
request is filed within 30 days preceding the date of such meeting.  In such
case, a decision may be made by no later than the date of the second meeting
following the Plan s receipt of the request for review.  If special
circumstances (for example, if the Committee decides to hold a hearing on the
appeal) require a further extension of time for processing, the decision shall
be rendered as soon as possible, but no later than the third meeting following
the Plan s receipt of the request for review.  If special circumstances require
that the decision will be made beyond the initial time for furnishing the
decision, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant
(or his or her authorized representative) prior to the commencement of the
extension.  The decision on review shall be in writing and shall be furnished
to the claimant or his or her authorized representative within the appropriate
time for the decision.  If a decision on review is not furnished within the
appropriate time, the claim shall be deemed to have been denied on appeal.  

  10.8         The Committee may, in its sole
discretion, decide to hold a hearing if it determines that a hearing is
necessary or appropriate in order to make a full and fair review of the
appealed claim.  

  10.9         The decision on review shall
include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be
understood by the claimant, as well as specific references to the pertinent
Plan provisions on which the decision is based.  

  10.10       A person must exhaust his or her
rights to file a claim and to request a review of the denial of his or her
claim before bringing any civil action to recover benefits due to him under the
terms of the Plan, to enforce his or her rights under the terms of the Plan, or
to clarify his or her rights to future benefits under the terms of the Plan.  

  10.11       The Committee shall exercise its
responsibility and authority under this claims procedure as a fiduciary and, in
such capacity, shall have the discretionary authority and responsibility (1) to
interpret and construe the Plan and any rules or regulations under the Plan,
(2) to determine the eligibility of Nonemployee Directors to participate in the
Plan, and the rights of Participants to receive benefits under the Plan, and
(3) to make factual determinations in connection with any of the foregoing.  

   ARTICLE XI 
GENERAL PROVISIONS   

  11.1         No right or interest of any
person entitled to a benefit under the Plan shall be subject to voluntary or
involuntary alienation, assignment, or transfer of any kind.  

  11.2         No right or benefit hereunder
shall in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts,
liabilities, or torts of the person entitled to benefits under this Plan. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the
Code and subject to Section 6.8, the Committee shall honor a judgment, order or
decree from a state domestic relations court which requires the payment of part
or all of a Participant s or beneficiary s interest under this Plan to an
 alternate payee  as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.  

  11.3         The Company s obligations under
this Plan shall be as unfunded and unsecured promise to pay and all payments
from the Plan will be made from the general funds of the Company.  The Company
may establish a grantor trust to assist it in meeting its obligations under
this Plan;      

however, the Company shall not be obligated
to establish such a trust, and if established, the Company shall not be
obligated to make contributions to the trust.  Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, in the case of a Change in Control, the Company shall
irrevocably set aside funds in an irrevocable  rabbi trust  in an amount that
is sufficient to pay each Participant the value of the Participant s Duke
Energy Common Stock   Merged Plans Subaccount, if any, as of the date on which
the Change in Control occurs; provided, however, that the trust shall not be
funded if the funding thereof would result in taxable income to the Participant
by reason of Section 409A(b) of the Code; and provided, further, in no event
shall any trust assets at any time be located or transferred outside of the
United States, within the meaning of Section 409A(b) of the Code.    

  11.4         This Plan shall be construed and
administered in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina to the
extent that such laws are not preempted by Federal law.  

  11.5            Transfer of Accounts   . 
The Account of each member of the Board of Directors of Spectra Energy Corp or
its predecessor companies (a  Spectra Energy Participant ) maintained under the
Plan immediately prior to the spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp was transferred
to the Spectra Energy Corp Directors  Savings Plan and assumed by Spectra
Energy Corp as of the spin-off (the  Assumed Amounts ).  For purposes of this
Plan, the term  Assumed Amounts  shall include any amount of Compensation of a
Spectra Energy Participant that is earned but not yet paid as of the spin-off
and phantom stock units granted to a Spectra Energy Participant under the Duke
Energy Corporation 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, that were properly deferred
by a member of the Spectra Energy Corp Board of Directors under the Plan but
that had not yet been credited to his or her Account under the Plan as of the
spin-off.  Each such Spectra Energy Participant shall have no further rights
under the Plan immediately after his or her Account is transferred to the
Spectra Energy Corp Directors  Savings Plan and assumed by Spectra Energy Corp
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employee Matters Agreement
by and between Duke Energy Corporation and Spectra Energy Corp (the  Employee
Matters Agreement ).  Capitalized terms used in this Section that are not
defined in this Plan shall have the meaning set forth in the Employee Matters
Agreement.  

  11.6            Compliance with Section 409A
of the Code   .  It is intended that the Plan comply with the provisions of
Section 409A of the Code, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any
amounts deferred hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the taxable year
or years in which such amounts would otherwise actually be paid or made
available to Participants or Beneficiaries. This Plan shall be construed,
administered, and governed in a manner that effects such intent, and the
Committee shall not take any action that would be inconsistent with such
intent.  Although the Committee shall use its best efforts to avoid the
imposition of taxation, interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code,
the tax treatment of deferrals under this Plan is not warranted or guaranteed. 
Neither the Company, the other members of the Affiliated Group, their
respective directors, officers, employees and advisors, the Board, nor the
Committee (nor its designee) shall be held liable for any taxes, interest,
penalties or other monetary amounts owed by any Participant, beneficiary or
other taxpayer as a result of the Plan.  Any reference in this Plan to Section
409A of the Code will also include any proposed, temporary or final regulations,
or any other guidance, promulgated with respect to such Section 409A of the
Code by the U.S. Department of Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service.  For
purposes of the Plan, the phrase  permitted by Section 409A of the Code,  or
words or phrases of similar import, shall mean that the event or circumstance
shall only be permitted to the extent it would not cause an amount deferred or
payable under the Plan to be includible in the gross income of a Participant or
beneficiary under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.  

  11.7            Electronic or Other Media   . 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, including any
provision that requires the use of a written instrument, the Committee may
establish procedures for the use of electronic or other media in communications
and transactions between the Plan or the Committee and Participants and
beneficiaries.  Electronic or other media may include, but are not limited to,
e-mail, the Internet, intranet systems and automated telephonic response systems.  

                  This
amendment and restatement of the Plan has been executed on behalf of the
Company this ___ day of December, 2013.

 AMENDMENT TO EXECUTIVE CASH BALANCE PLAN

EXHIBIT 10.52   

DUKE ENERGY
CORPORATION  
EXECUTIVE CASH BALANCE PLAN   

   (Amended and Restated
Effective as of January 1, 2014)   

   ARTICLE I  
PURPOSE OF PLAN   

  The purpose of the Duke Energy Corporation
Executive Cash Balance Plan (the  Plan ) is to provide additional retirement
benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.  The
Plan originally was effective as of January 1, 1997 and was amended thereafter
from time to time. Effective January 1, 1999, the Plan replaced the PanEnergy
Corp Key Executive Retirement Benefit Equalization Plan and all benefits
provided thereunder were provided in accordance with the terms set forth
herein. The Plan is intended to be a non-qualified, unfunded plan of deferred
compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
( ERISA ), and shall be so interpreted and administered.  Effective August 26,
2008, the Plan was amended and restated in its entirety in order to comply with
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). 
Effective on July 2, 2012, the Plan was amended and restated in its entirety to
reflect the participation by, and assumption of the obligations of, certain
individuals who participated in or, but for the service eligibility
requirements, would have participated in the Amended and Restated Supplemental
Senior Executive Retirement Plan of Progress Energy, Inc. (the  Progress
Nonqualified Plan ).  Effective January 1, 2014, the Plan is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety, as set forth herein, to reflect the mergers of the
Amended and Restated Progress Energy, Inc. Restoration Retirement Plan (the
 Progress RRP ) and Cinergy Corp. Excess Pension Plan (the  Cinergy Excess
Plan ) with and into the Plan and to close participation in the Plan to new
hires and rehires.    

  The Plan was divided into two separate parts,
one of which is referred to herein as  Part I  and the other is referred to
herein as  Part II.   Any  amounts deferred  under the Plan in taxable years
beginning before January 1, 2005 (within the meaning of Section 409A of the
Code) and any earnings thereon shall be governed by the terms of Part I of the
Plan, as set forth herein.  It is intended that such amounts and the earnings
thereon shall be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code. 
Nothing contained herein is intended to materially enhance a benefit or right
existing under Part I of the Plan as of October 3, 2004, or add a new material
benefit or right to Part I of the Plan.  As of January 1, 2005 ( Effective
Date ), Part I of the Plan was frozen, and neither the Company, its affiliates
nor any individual shall make or permit to be made any additional contributions
or deferrals under Part I of the Plan (other than earnings) on or after that
date.   

  Any  amounts deferred  in taxable years
beginning on or after January 1, 2005 (within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code) and any earnings thereon shall be governed by the terms and
conditions of Part II of the Plan, as set forth herein.  To the extent that any
of those amounts were credited under the Plan prior to the Effective Date (the
 Transferred Amounts ), then the Committee shall transfer the Transferred
Amounts from Part I of the Plan to Part II of the Plan and credit those amounts
to the appropriate bookkeeping accounts under Part II of this Plan, as selected
by the Committee in its sole discretion.  As a result of such transfer and
crediting, all of the Company s obligations and Participant s rights with
respect to the Transferred Amounts under Part I of the Plan, if any, shall
automatically be extinguished and become obligations and rights under Part II
of this Plan without further action.  For purposes of clarity, (i) the
obligations assumed from Part I of the Cinergy Excess Plan shall be governed by
the terms and conditions of Part I of the Plan, as set forth herein, and (ii) the
obligations assumed from the Progress Nonqualified Plan, the Progress RRP, and
Part II of the Cinergy Excess Plan shall be governed by the terms and
conditions of Part II of the Plan, as set forth herein.  

   ARTICLE II

Section 414(b) of the Code, the term  at least 45 percent  is used instead of

determining trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated) that are under
common control for purposes of Section 414(c), the term  at least 45 percent 
is used instead of  at least 80 percent  each place it appears in that

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Employee who is not a member of a  select
group of management or highly compensated employees  within the meaning of
ERISA, may not participate in the Plan.  Participants shall not receive any
benefits under the terms of the Supplemental Retirement Plan, the Supplemental
Security Plan or the Equalization Plan.  For purposes of clarity, the

Plan.   

  3.3              Progress Nonqualified Plan

immediately prior to July 2, 2012 (each, a  Progress Nonqualified Plan
Participant ) became eligible to participate in the Plan as of July 2, 2012 and
shall remain eligible as long as he continues to be an Employee.  The obligations
and rights of the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participants under the Progress
Nonqualified Plan were extinguished as of July 2, 2012 and became obligations
and rights under this Plan, as set forth herein.  For purposes of clarity, the
obligations and rights of participants in the Progress Nonqualified Plan other
than the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participants shall not become obligations
or rights under this Plan.  

  3.4              Progress RRP Participants   . 
Effective as of January 1, 2014, each individual who was a participant in or,
but for the service eligibility requirements, would be a participant in the
Progress RRP on December 31, 2013 (each, a  Progress RRP Participant ), shall
be eligible to participate in the Plan as of January 1, 2014.  The obligations
and rights of the Progress RRP Participants under the Progress RRP shall
automatically be extinguished as of January 1, 2014 and shall become

clarity, each Progress RRP Participant shall be entitled to the Progress RRP
benefit provided in Section 6.10 and have a Make-Whole Account (with an opening
balance of zero dollars ($0.00)) established under the Plan as of January 1,
2014.  

  3.5     Cinergy Excess Plan Participants   . 
Effective as of January 1, 2014, each individual who was a participant in the

a cash balance make-whole account and/or supplemental account under the Cinergy
Excess Plan shall have a Make-Whole Account and/or Supplemental Account
established under the Plan as of January 1, 2014 with an opening balance equal
to the balance in the cash balance make-whole account and/or supplemental
account respectively under the Cinergy Excess Plan as the close of December 31,
2013.  The categories of Cinergy Excess Plan Participants are listed in Exhibit
B.  

   ARTICLE IV  
BENEFITS   

  4.1              General Rule   .  The Plan
provides a Make-Whole Benefit and may provide a Supplemental Benefit.  Each
Participant shall have a Make-Whole Account (with an opening balance of zero
dollars ($0.00) except as otherwise provided), which is a bookkeeping account
established under this Plan and shall be eligible for a Make-Whole Benefit. The
Committee will determine whether a Participant is to be eligible for a
Supplemental Benefit, in which case a  Supplemental Account,  which is a
bookkeeping account, shall be established.   

  4.2              Pay Credits to the
Make-Whole Account   .  Under the Make-Whole Benefit, for any month that a
Participant is eligible to participate in this Plan, the Participant s
Make-Whole Account shall receive a Pay Credit equal to the excess, if any, of
(a) the pay credit that would have been provided under the Retirement Cash
Balance Plan for the month if the Retirement Cash Balance Plan used the
definition of Compensation set forth herein and, to the extent determined by
the Committee from time to time, other types of excluded pay were treated as
eligible compensation under such Plan; over (b) the pay credit for the month
that is actually made to the Participant s account under the Retirement Cash
Balance Plan.  In addition, the Make-Whole Benefit provides a Pay Credit to the
Participant s Make-Whole Account equal to any reduction in a benefit under the
Retirement Cash Balance Plan (for purposes of clarity, note that this includes
the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan) resulting from the limitations imposed
by Section 415 of the Code.  Where an opening account balance under the
Retirement Cash Balance Plan has been established for a Participant, the
Committee, in its sole discretion, may establish an opening balance for the
Participant s Make-Whole Account that is designed to provide a transition
benefit comparable to the benefit provided through the Retirement Cash Balance
Plan opening account balance, but without regard to the limitations imposed by
Sections 401(a)(17) or 415 of the Code.  If the value of the benefit which a
vested Participant had accrued under the Supplemental Retirement Plan as of
December 31, 1996, is greater than the value of the Participant s Make-Whole
Account on the date the Participant retires, such higher value shall apply.   

4.3              Supplemental
Credits   .  A Participant s Supplemental Account shall receive such
Supplemental Credits, in such amounts and at such times, as the Committee, in
its sole discretion, may determine.  Supplemental Credits may include, but are
not limited to, an opening account balance or a one-time credit in recognition
of the December 31, 1998, discontinuance of supplemental pay credits.
Notwithstanding Sections 4.3 and 4.4 to the contrary, the Minimum Benefit
feature of Section 4.3(e) of the Plan, as in effect prior to January 1, 1999,
is preserved herein and incorporated by reference.   

  4.4              Interest Credits   .  An
Interest Credit will be added to a Participant s Make-Whole Account and to a
Participant s Supplemental Account as of the end of each calendar month ending
prior to the month in which the respective account is fully distributed or
forfeited. The amount of the Interest Credit for a month will equal the balance
of the respective account as of the end of the prior month (after adding any
Pay Credit, Supplemental Credit and Interest Credit for the prior month and
subtracting any payment or forfeiture for the prior month) multiplied by the
Interest Factor for the month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for purposes
of Part I only, Interest Credits to the Supplemental Account of a Participant
whose employment with the Company terminates before attaining the earliest
retirement age under the Retirement Cash Balance Plan will be suspended
beginning with the month during which employment terminates and will not resume
until the month following the month during which payment of the Supplemental
Benefit commences.   

   ARTICLE V  
VESTING   

  5.1              General Rule   .  Unless
the Committee provides otherwise for a particular Participant at the time the
Participant initially becomes eligible to participate in the Plan or at the
time of an award of a particular Supplemental Credit (and any Interest Credits
thereto), a Participant will become fully vested in the Participant s
Make-Whole Account, and the Participant s Supplemental Account, if any, when
(i) the Participant becomes vested under the Retirement Cash Balance Plan, or
(ii) the Participant s employment with the Company terminates on account of the
Participant s death or the Participant having become  Disabled , as defined in
the Retirement Cash Balance Plan.  If a Participant s employment with the
Company terminates and the Participant is not fully vested, the unvested
portion of the Participant s Make-Whole Account and of the Participant s
Supplemental Account, if any, shall be immediately forfeited and no benefit
under the Plan shall be paid with respect thereto.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant shall become vested in, and
entitled to a benefit under, the Plan after completing: (a) 10 years of Service
(as defined in Exhibit A) and (b) three years of employment at the level of
 Senior Vice President and above,  which shall include (I) for periods prior to
July 2, 2012, employment with Progress Energy, Inc. and its affiliates at the
Senior Vice President and above level, and (II) for periods after July 2, 2012,
any employment with the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Progress RRP
Participant shall be subject to the following with respect to the Progress RRP
Participant s Progress RRP benefit:  

  (a)           Any Progress
RRP Participant who terminates employment with the Affiliated Group without
being 100% vested under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan shall not be
eligible to receive any benefits under Section 6.10 and shall forfeit his
Progress RRP benefit.  

  (b)           Notwithstanding any
other provision of the Plan, no Progress RRP benefit shall be payable under
Section 6.10 with respect to a Progress RRP Participant whose employment with
the Affiliated Group is terminated for Cause.  As used herein, the term
 Cause  shall be limited to (a) action involving willful
malfeasance having a material adverse effect on a member of the Affiliated
Group, (b) substantial and continuing willful refusal to perform the
duties ordinarily performed by an employee in the same position and having
similar duties, (c) being convicted of a felony, or (d) willful
failure to comply with an applicable Code of Conduct or other Policy or
Procedure of a member of the Affiliated Group.  

  Each
Cinergy Excess Plan Participant who participated in the Cinergy Corp. Executive
Life Insurance Program and was an employee of the Company on December 31, 2008
and thereby became entitled to a Supplemental Credit to his Supplemental
Account shall come vested in such Supplemental Credit to his Supplemental
Account only if he attains age 50 and has at least five years of service under
the Retirement Cash Balance Plan prior to his Separation from Service.  If a
Cinergy Excess Plan Participant's employment with the Company terminates and he
is not fully vested, the unvested portion of his benefit shall be immediately
forfeited and no benefit under the Plan shall be paid with respect thereto.  

  5.2              Prior Supplemental Credits   . 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any one-time Supplemental Credit to a
Participant s Supplemental Account that is made in recognition of the December
31, 1998 discontinuance of supplemental pay credit, and any Interest Credits
thereon, shall not vest, and shall be forfeited if the Participant s employment
with the Company terminates before January 1, 2004, unless such employment
termination is on account of the Participant s retirement under the Retirement
Cash Balance Plan, death, or the Participant having become  Disabled,  as
defined in the Retirement Cash Balance Plan, or unless such employment
termination is by the Company other than for  cause . The Company shall have
 cause  to terminate the Participant s employment upon (a) the willful and
continued failure by the Participant to substantially perform his employment
duties (other than any such failure resulting from the Participant s incapacity
due to physical or mental illness) after demand for substantial performance is
delivered by the Company, specifically identifying the manner in which the
Company believes the Participant has not substantially performed his duties, or
(b) the willful engaging by the Participant in misconduct which is materially
injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of this
Section, no act, or failure to act, on the Participant s part shall be
considered  willful  unless done, or omitted to be done, by him not in good
faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best
interest of the Company.   

  5.3              Change in Control   .  In
the event of a Change in Control, all Participant accounts under the Plan shall
become fully and immediately vested and non-forfeitable and shall thereafter be
maintained and paid in accordance with the terms of this Plan.   

   ARTICLE VI  
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS   

  6.1(a)         Timing of Payments Under Part
I   .   Except as provided in Section 6.11, for purposes of Part I of the
Plan, a Participant whose Company employment terminates prior to the
Participant s earliest retirement age under the Retirement Cash Balance Plan
will receive, or will begin to receive, payment of his vested Make-Whole
Account and his vested Supplemental Account, if any, as soon as
administratively feasible following the month in which the Participant attains
age 55.  A Participant whose Company employment terminates after the
Participant s earliest retirement age under the Retirement Cash Balance Plan
will receive, or will begin to receive, payment of his vested Make-Whole
Account and his vested Supplemental Account, if any, as soon as
administratively feasible following the month in which the Participant s
employment terminates.  Any other Participant whose Company employment
terminates and whose Make-Whole Account and Supplemental Account, if any, have
a combined balance, as of the last day of the month during which employment
terminated, of less than $25,000, will receive payment of his vested Make-Whole
Account and his vested Supplemental Account, if any, in a single sum, as soon
as administratively feasible following the month in which the Participant s
employment with the Company terminates.  

6.1(b)         Timing
of Payments Under Part II   .   Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.9,
6.10, and 6.11, for purposes of Part II of the Plan, and subject to Section
6.5, each Participant will receive, or will begin to receive, payment of his
vested Make-Whole Account and his vested Supplemental Account, if any, within
60 days after Separation from Service.   

  6.2(a)(1)     Election of Form of Benefit
Under Part I   .  Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.11, with respect
to Part I of the Plan, each Participant has been provided the opportunity to
elect from among the forms of benefit payment specified in Section 6.2(b)(1)
the manner in which such Participant s vested Make-Whole Account and his vested
Supplemental Account, if any, shall be paid. A Participant may change his form
of benefit payment election under Part I of the Plan at any time, and from time
to time, by completing such form as the Committee provides and filing the
completed form with the Committee. No such change shall become effective unless
and until the Participant has continued in employment with the Company for at
least one year from the date on which the Committee receives notification of
the change.   

  6.2(a)(2)     Election of Form of Benefit
Under Part II   .   With respect to Part II of the Plan, no later than
December 31, 2008 (or such earlier date set by the Committee), each Participant
elected from among the forms of benefit payment specified in Section 6.2(b)(2)
the manner in which such Participant s vested Make-Whole Account and his vested
Supplemental Account, if any, shall be paid. The election described in this
Section 6.2(a)(2) was subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee
specified in its sole discretion and consistent with the terms of Notice
2007-86 and the applicable proposed and final Treasury Regulations issued under
Section 409A of the Code.  To the extent that a Participant did not designate the
manner in which such Participant s vested Make-Whole Account and his vested
Supplemental Account, if any, shall be paid as provided in this Section
6.2(a)(2) (or such designation does not comply with the terms of Part II of the
Plan), such accounts shall be paid in a single lump sum. Notwithstanding
anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, except Section 6.2(d) or
Sections 6.9, 6.10, and 6.11, or any other plan, policy, practice or program,
contract or agreement with the Company or the Affiliated Group (unless
otherwise specifically provided therein in a specific reference to this Plan),
a Participant who becomes eligible to participate in the Plan (including the
Cinergy Excess Plan as defined in Section 6.11) after December 31, 2008 shall
have no right to choose a form of payment for his accounts, and, instead, his
vested Make-Whole Account and his vested Supplemental Account, if any, shall be
paid in a single lump sum.   

  6.2(b)(1)     Forms of Benefit Under Part I   .  
Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.11, the forms of benefit payment
available under Part I of the Plan are:   

  (A)         single lump sum payment;   
(B)         monthly payments for three years;   
(C)         monthly payments for ten years; and   
(D)         monthly payments for fifteen years.    

  At
such time as benefits under the Plan become payable with respect to a
Participant, such benefits shall be paid in accordance with the benefit payment
form then in effect unless otherwise expressly provided by the Plan.   

  6.2(b)(2)     Forms of Benefit Under Part II   .  
Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.9, 6.10, and 6.11, the forms of
benefit payment available under Part II of the Plan are:   

  (A)         single lump sum payment;   
(B)         monthly payments for two to ten years; and   
(C)         monthly payments for fifteen years.    

  At
such time as benefits under the Plan become payable with respect to a
Participant, such benefits shall be paid in accordance with the benefit payment
form then in effect unless otherwise expressly provided by the Plan.   

  6.2(c)         Calculation of Installment
Payments   .  In the event of monthly installment payments, the amount of the
payment for a particular month shall be calculated as follows:   

Monthly
  amount  

=  

V    
  N  

where  

N  

represents
  the number of months remaining in the payment term and   

V  

represents
  the sum of the balance of the Participant s Make-Whole Account and the
  balance of the Participant s Supplemental Account, if any, determined as of
  the end of the prior month after adding any Pay Credits, Supplemental Credits
  and Interest Credits for the prior month and subtracting any payment or
  forfeiture for the prior month.  

6.2(d)         Forms of Benefit  
Supplemental Account   .  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan,
prior to making a Supplemental Credit (including a Supplemental Credit under
Section 6.11), the Committee may provide that the portion of the Participant s
vested Supplemental Account that is attributable to such Supplemental Credit
shall be distributed in any benefit payment form specified in advance by the
Committee.   

  6.3              Payments in Cash   .  Any
benefit payment due under the Plan shall be paid in cash.  

  6.4              Financial Hardship   . 
Upon written request by a Participant, the Committee may distribute to a
Participant who is receiving a monthly payment form of distribution, such
amount of the remaining balance of the Participant s vested Make-Whole Account
and vested Supplemental Account, if any, which the Committee determines is
necessary to provide for a financial hardship suffered by the Participant. For
purposes of Part I of the Plan, the term  financial hardship  shall mean a
severe financial hardship as determined under federal income tax law,
regulations and rulings which are applicable to non-qualified deferred
compensation plans. For purposes of Part II of the Plan, the term  financial
hardship  shall mean an  unforeseeable      

emergency  as
defined under Section 409A of the Code. Payment shall be made within 60 days
following the determination that a withdrawal shall be permitted under this
Section, or such later date as may be required under Section 6.5.   

  6.5              Mandatory Six-Month Delay
Under Part II   .  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.6(a) and (b),
and to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code, with respect to any
Participant who is a Specified Employee as of his Separation from Service,
except as provided below, the payment of benefits from Part II of the Plan that
are otherwise payable pursuant to the Participant s Separation from Service
shall commence within 60 days after the first business day of the seventh month
following such Separation from Service (or if earlier, upon the Participant s
death).  All annuity amounts that would otherwise be paid under Sections 6.9 or
6.10 during the first six months following the Separation for Service shall
instead be accumulated through and paid on the first business day of the
seventh month following the Separation from Service.  All annuity payments
payable under Part II as described in Section 6.11 that are otherwise payable
pursuant to, and during the six-month period commencing upon, a Cinergy Excess
Plan Participant s Separation from Service, shall be accumulated (along with
interest determined utilizing the Interest Factor) and shall be paid within 60
days after the first business day of the seventh month following such
Separation from Service (or if earlier, upon the Cinergy Excess Plan
Participant's death).  If the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant under
Section 6.9 or the Progress RRP Participant under Section 6.10 dies following
Separation from Service but prior to the commencement of payments, then, (i) in
the case of benefits payable pursuant to Section 6.9(b) or 6.10, the
Participant s surviving Eligible Spouse, if any, or Beneficiary, if applicable,
shall be entitled to receive the same death benefit as if the Participant had
commenced receiving benefit payments as of the first day of the month prior to
his death, and (ii) in the case of benefits payable pursuant to Section 6.9(c),
the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s surviving Eligible Spouse, if any,
shall be eligible for the surviving spouse benefit set forth therein.  

  6.6              Discretionary Acceleration
of Payment   .  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the time
or schedule of a payment under Part II of the Plan to a time or form otherwise
permitted under Section 409A of the Code in accordance with the requirements,
restrictions and limitations of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j) (   e.g.   ,
relating to domestic relations orders, employment taxes, conflict of interests,
income inclusion under Section 409A of the Code, state, local or foreign taxes,
offsets, bona fide disputes and small accounts); provided that in no event may
a payment be accelerated following a Specified Employee's Separation from
Service to a date that is prior to the first business day of the seventh month
following this Participant's Separation from Service (or if earlier, upon the
Participant's death) unless specifically permitted under Section 409A of the
Code) (   e.g.   , relating to domestic relations orders, employment taxes and
conflict of interests).  Except as otherwise specifically provided in Part II
of this Plan, the Committee may not accelerate the time or schedule of any
payment or amount scheduled to be paid under the Plan within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code.  

  6.7              Discretionary Delay of
Payments   .  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, delay the time or
form of payment under Part II of the Plan to a time or form otherwise permitted
under Section 409A of the Code in accordance with the requirements,
restrictions and limitations of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(7) (   e.g.,    
relating to compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code, federal securities laws
or other applicable laws); provided that the Committee treats all payments to
similarly situated Participants on a reasonably consistent basis.  

  6.8              Actual Date of Payment   . 
If calculation of the amount of the payment under Part II of the Plan is not
administratively practicable due to events beyond the control of the
Participant (or Beneficiary), the payment will be treated as made upon the date
specified under Part II of the Plan if the payment is made during the first calendar
year in which the calculation of the amount of the payment is administratively
practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment must be made no later than
the latest possible date permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Moreover,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary except Section
6.5, and to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, a payment will be
treated as made upon the date specified under Part II of the Plan if the
payment is made as close as administratively practicable to the relevant
payment date specified herein, and in any event within the same calendar year.   

  6.9              Progress Nonqualified Plan
Participants   .  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the
contrary, the amount of benefit and payment terms for a Progress Nonqualified
Plan Participant shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 6.9. For purposes of clarity, (i) this Section 6.9 reflects the
obligations and rights assumed from the Progress Nonqualified Plan with respect
to the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participants and (ii) the Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participants shall have no further rights under the Progress
Nonqualified Plan.   

  (a)              Calculation of Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participant Benefit   .  A Progress Nonqualified Plan
Participant s benefit from the Plan shall equal the greater of (i) or (ii),
where (i) and (ii) are as follows:   

  (i)            The amount in this Section
6.9(a)(i) is the sum of the Frozen Progress Nonqualified Plan Benefit (as
defined in Exhibit A) and ECBP Benefit for Progress Nonqualified Plan
Participant (as defined in Exhibit A).    

  (ii)           The amount in this Section
6.9(a)(ii) is the Minimum Progress Nonqualified Plan Benefit (as defined in
Exhibit A).    

  (b)              General Payment Terms   . 
Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.9(c), (d) or (e), the Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participant s benefit shall be paid in the form of (i) if the
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant does not have an Eligible Spouse on the
date payments under this Plan commence, a Single Life Annuity, commencing
within 60 days after the first day of the calendar month next following the
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s Separation from Service, and ending
with a payment for the month in which the Progress Nonqualified Plan
Participant s death occurs; provided that the monthly installments shall be
guaranteed for 120 monthly payments with any such guaranteed payments remaining
at such Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s death payable to his
Beneficiary or, (ii) if the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant has an
Eligible Spouse on the date payments under this Plan commence, then a 50%
Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity for the life of the Progress Nonqualified
Plan Participant, and after the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s death,
for the life of the surviving Eligible Spouse, if any.   

  (c)              Deferred Vested Benefits   . 
If a Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant incurs a Separation from Service
after completing 10 or more years of Service and before being eligible for a
normal or early retirement benefit under Paragraph 1 or 2 of Exhibit A, then
except as provided in Section 6.9(e), the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s
benefit under Section 6.9(a) shall be paid in monthly installments, commencing
on the first day of the calendar month coinciding with or next following the
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s 65th birthday and ending with a
payment for the month in which the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s
death occurs; provided that, if the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant is
receiving, or dies after attaining age 55 while entitled to receive, the
deferred vested benefit, then the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s
Eligible Spouse (if any) shall be entitled to an amount equal to 50% of the
deferred vested benefit the deceased Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant was
receiving immediately prior to his death (or would have been entitled to
receive if the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant had survived until his
65th birthday), which amount shall be payable to the Eligible Spouse in monthly
installments commencing in the month following the Progress Nonqualified Plan
Participant s death and ending with a payment for the month in which the
Eligible Spouse s death occurs.   

(d)              Pre-Retirement
Death Benefits   .  If a Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant dies while in
the employ of the Company after completing 10 or more years of Service, the
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s Eligible Spouse shall be eligible for
an annuity in an amount equal to the standard benefit or, if greater,
alternative benefit (as specified below) commencing, except as provided in
Section 6.5, in the month following the Progress Nonqualified Plan
Participant s death and shall continue thereafter ending with a payment for the
month in which the Eligible Spouse s death occurs. The standard benefit shall
be an amount equal to the greater of (i) or (ii), where   

  (i)            is the sum of (A) and (B),

Pension (as defined in Exhibit A), each determined as if the Progress Nonqualified
Plan Participant died as of July 2, 2012, and (B) the benefit under Section 7.1
with the Eligible Spouse as Beneficiary (   i.e.   , the sum of the balance in
the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s Make-Whole Benefit Account and
Supplemental Benefit Account) determined as of the Progress Nonqualified Plan
Participant s actual date of death, actuarially adjusted using the actuarial
assumptions specified in the definition of ECBP Benefit for Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participant in Paragraph 4 of Exhibit A to an annuity payable
for the life of the Eligible Spouse, and    

  (ii)           is the excess, if any between
(I) forty percent (40%) of the Target Pre-Retirement Death Benefit (as defined
in Exhibit A) over (II) the Spouse s Pension (as defined in Exhibit A), each
determined as of the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s actual date of
death.    

  The
alternative benefit shall be available to a surviving Eligible Spouse of the
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant who dies while in the employ of the
Company after attaining age 55 with 15 years of Service and shall be equal to
50% of the benefit the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant would have been
entitled to receive under Section 6.9(a) calculated as if the Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participant had a Separation from Service immediately prior
to his death.   

  (e)              Definitions   .  See
Article II and Exhibit A.   

  6.10            Progress RRP Participants   . 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, the amount of
benefit and payment terms for a Progress RRP Participant with respect to the
Progress RRP benefit shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 6.10.  The benefit of a Progress RRP Participant under the Plan
shall consist of the sum of (a) the Progress RRP benefit under this Section
6.10 and (b) the Make-Whole Benefit under Section 4.1 for periods on and after January
1, 2014.  For purposes of clarity, (i) this Section 6.10 reflects the
obligations and rights assumed from the Progress RRP with respect to the
Progress RRP Participants and (ii) the Progress RRP Participants shall have no
further rights under the Progress RRP.   

  (a)              Calculation of Progress RRP
Benefit   .  A Progress RRP Participant s benefit under this Section 6.10
shall mean, as of any determination date, the excess of (i) a
Participant's accrued benefit calculated under the Progress Qualified Retirement
Plan as of December 31, 2013 (A) assuming a Participant's compensation under
the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan includes Deferrals of a Participant and
(B) without regard to the Compensation and Benefit Limitations, over
(ii) a Participant's accrued benefit calculated under the Progress
Qualified Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2013.  For this purpose, a
Participant's accrued benefit shall be calculated in the form of a single life
annuity for a Participant who does not have a Spouse and in the form of a 50%
qualified joint and survivor annuity for a Participant who has a Spouse, with
such calculation performed without regard to any other form of benefit elected
by a Participant under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan.  The Progress
RRP benefit is determined for non-bargaining employees of Progress Energy
Florida, Inc. and corporate employees of Progress Fuels Corporation solely with
respect to employment on or after January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2013.   

  (b)              General Payment Terms   . 
Subject to the forfeiture provisions of Section 5.1, lump sum payment
provisions of Section 6.10(d), and Section 6.5, a Participant who becomes
eligible for the payment of a Progress RRP benefit shall be entitled to monthly
benefit payments commencing within sixty days after Separation from
Service.  The monthly payment shall be in the form of a single life annuity if
the Participant has no Spouse and in the form of a 50% joint and survivor
annuity if the Participant has a Spouse, with the Spouse (determined at the
Separation from Service) entitled to any survivor benefit upon the death of the
Participant.  

  (c)              Pre-Retirement Death Benefit   . 
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.10(d), if a surviving Spouse of a
deceased Participant is eligible for a pre-retirement death benefit or death
benefit under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan, then upon such
Participant's death, such Spouse shall be entitled to a monthly benefit payment
under the Plan equal to the amount, if any, by which (i) exceeds (ii) each
month, where (i) is the Spouse's monthly death benefit that would be
payable in accordance with the provisions of the Progress Qualified Retirement
Plan with respect to the Participant's accrued benefit calculated under the
Progress Qualified Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2013 as if (A) the
Participant's Compensation under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan
included Deferrals and (B) the Compensation and Benefit Limitations did
not apply, and (ii) is the monthly death benefit payable under the
Progress Qualified Retirement Plan with respect to the Participant's accrued
benefit calculated under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan as of December
31, 2013, and assuming for purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) that
the Spouse elected  a monthly annuity as a death benefit under the Progress
Qualified Retirement Plan commencing on the same date as the preretirement
death benefit is payable to the Spouse under this Section 6.10(c).  The
pre-retirement death benefit under this Plan shall commence within sixty days
of the first day of the month following the Participant's death, and shall
continue on the first day of each month thereafter for the life of the Spouse.  

  (d)              Lump Sum Payments   .  The
Committee shall provide for the payment under the Plan of a cash lump sum amount
in lieu of the annuity otherwise payable under Sections 6.10(b) or (c), if
the annuity amount to be paid is less than $500 per month.  For a Participant
(or spouse) whose benefit under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan is based
upon the Participant's cash balance account, the lump sum shall be equal to
what the Progress RRP benefit would be if  Cash Balance Account  were
substituted for  accrued benefit  in Section 6.10(a) and the
Progress RRP benefit referred to a lump sum dollar amount.  For a Participant
(or Spouse) whose benefit under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan is based
on the final average pay formula pension, the lump sum shall be equal to the
Actuarial Value of the annuity payments that would otherwise be made to the
Participant (or Spouse) under Sections 6.10(b) or (c), as the case may
be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no lump sum payment shall be made under
this Section 6.10(d) unless (i) the payment accompanies the termination of
the entirety of the Participant's interest under this Section 6.10;
(ii) the payment is made on or before the later of
(A) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Termination of the
Participant occurs, or (B) the date that is 2 1/2 months after the
Separation from Service; and (iii) the payment is not greater than
$75,000.  

  (e)              Definitions   .  For
purposes of this Section 6.10:  

(i)             Actuarial
Value  shall mean the applicable mortality table as in effect from time to time
as defined in Section 417(e) of the Code and the applicable interest rate as defined
in Section 417(e) of the Code for the month of August prior to the beginning of
the Plan Year during which the Separation from Service (or date of death)

mean a Participant's deferrals of compensation under the Progress Energy, Inc.
Amended and Restated Management Deferred Compensation Plan or Duke Energy
Corporation Executive Savings Plan or any successor plan to the extent not
utilized in calculating a Participant's accrued benefit under the Progress
Qualified Retirement Plan.  

  (iv)           Progress Qualified Retirement
Plan  shall have the meaning provided in Exhibit A.  

  (v)            Spouse  shall mean
the spouse of a Participant as would be determined at the applicable time under
the definition of Spouse in the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan (or any
successor provisions).  

  6.11            Cinergy Excess Plan
Participants   .  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the
contrary, the amount of benefit and payment terms for a Cinergy Excess Plan
Participant shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 6.11.  The benefit of a Cinergy Excess Plan Participant under the Plan
shall consist of (a) the Cinergy Excess Plan benefit under this Section 6.11
and (b) the Make-Whole Benefit and Supplemental Account benefit under Sections
4.1 and 4.3, if any.  For purposes of clarity, (i) this Section 6.11 reflects
the obligations and rights assumed from the Cinergy Excess Plan with respect to
the Cinergy Excess Plan Participants and (ii) the Cinergy Excess Plan
Participants shall have no further rights under the Cinergy Excess Plan.  

  (a)              Calculation of Cinergy
Excess Plan Benefit   .  A Cinergy Excess Plan Participant s benefit shall, as
applicable, include the following:

experience as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 2 of the Sixth
Amendment to the Cinergy Corp.  Non-Union Employees  Pension Plan (the  Cinergy
Non-Union Plan ) shall apply and (ii) a 3.8% interest crediting floor under the
investor and cash balance programs shall apply.  

  (ii)              Traditional Program Benefit   . 
A Cinergy Excess Plan Participant who had participated in the traditional
(final average pay) program of the Cinergy Non-Union Pension, but not the cash
balance program of the Cinergy Non-Union Plan or Retirement Cash Balance Plan
shall be entitled to a monthly benefit as provided by the Cinergy Excess
Pension Plan as in effect prior to December 31, 2013.  

  (iii)             Part A Choice Benefit   . 
A Cinergy Excess Plan Participant who is treated as a  choice participant 
under the Retirement Cash Balance Plan (   e.g.   , he elected to start
participating in the cash balance program effective on April 1, 2007) shall be
entitled to a monthly benefit with respect to the eligible Cinergy Excess Plan
Participant s Part A benefit under the Retirement Cash Balance Plan that is
equal to the excess, if any, of his Unrestricted Benefit over his Maximum
Benefit, as defined below, determined as of the date this Cinergy Excess Plan
benefit is to commence:

means, for this purpose, the monthly equivalent of the Part A benefit to which
the Cinergy Excess Plan Participant is entitled under the Retirement Cash
Balance Plan after applying Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code.  

  (B)            Unrestricted
Benefit  means, for this purpose, the monthly equivalent of the Part A
benefit to which the Cinergy Excess Plan Participant would be entitled under
the Retirement Cash Balance Plan, if that benefit had been determined without
regard to the limitations imposed on qualified retirement plan benefits under
Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code.  

  (iv)             Part A Automatic Benefit   . 
A Cinergy Excess Plan Participant who is treated as an  automatic conversion
participant  under the Retirement Cash Balance Plan (   i.e.   , he was
automatically converted to the cash balance program effective on January 1,
2011) shall be eligible for a Part A automatic benefit determined in the same
manner as the Part A choice benefit described above, but only with respect to
the eligible Cinergy Excess Plan Participant s Part A automatic benefit under
the Retirement Cash Balance Plan.  

  (v)              Cinergy Transition Benefit   . 
For those Cinergy Excess Plan Participants who were hired prior to 2003 and
elected to move from the traditional program to the investor program or
balanced program (as defined in the Cinergy Non-Union Plan) on January 1, 2003
(or later applicable rehire or transfer date), the Retirement Cash Balance Plan
provides that the annual pension shall be no less than the sum of the Cinergy
Excess Plan Participant's prior conversion pension and the annual pension if
the Cinergy Excess Plan Participant had no accrued benefit other than his cash
balance account and had no amount credited to the cash balance account as an
opening balance.  If, upon Separation from Service, the rule described in the
immediately preceding sentence is applicable to the Cinergy Excess Plan
Participant, determined as if the Cinergy Excess Plan Participant elected to
receive his Cinergy Excess Plan benefit in the form of a single life annuity
upon his Separation from Service, the Cinergy Excess Plan Participant shall
receive upon his Separation from Service, the actuarial equivalent (as defined
in the Retirement Cash Balance Plan) present value (   i.e.   , single lump
sum) of the additional benefit (if any) that would have been provided through
this rule, had the Cinergy Excess Plan benefit under this rule been determined
without regard to the limitations imposed by Sections 401(a)(17) or 415 of the
Code, which single lump sum shall be paid within 60 days after his Separation
from Service, or such later date required by Section 6.5.

Discretionary Incentive Pool Plan, or any successor plan (collectively a  Commercial
Unit Plan ), the amount of the cash award taken into account for a Plan
Year shall not exceed the Cinergy Excess Plan Participant's rate of annual base
salary or base wage, as applicable, as of the last day of the performance
period for which the award is calculated.  For purposes of clarity, any amount
payable under the Commercial Unit Plan or any other annual incentive plan
maintained by the Commercial Business Unit that is automatically deferred until
a subsequent Plan Year shall not be considered as part of the Cinergy Excess
Plan Participant's annual performance cash award.  

(vii)            Mid-Career
Benefit   .  The one individual (the  Legacy Mid-Career Participant ) who, as
of December 31, 2008, was an employee of Cinergy Corp., participated in the
Cinergy Corp. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and had not commenced

benefits under the Retirement Cash Balance Plan begin.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, where the actuarial equivalent present value of a Cinergy Excess
Plan Participant's Part I benefit payable does not exceed $5,000, the Committee
or its designee shall pay the actuarial equivalent of the benefit in a single
lump sum.  

  (B)              Part II   .  For purposes
of Cinergy Excess Plan Part II, and subject to Section 6.5, a Cinergy Excess
Plan Participant who incurs a Separation from Service on or after December 31,

with the default timing rules provided under the Cinergy Excess Plan in effect
prior to December 31, 2013.  

  (ii)              Election of Form of Benefit   . 
At such time as Cinergy Excess Plan benefits become payable with respect to a

Plan.  

  (B)              Part II   .     

  (I)               Participant Elections   . 
With respect to Cinergy Excess Plan Part II, no later than December 31, 2008
(or such earlier date set by the Committee), each Employee who was then a
Cinergy Excess Plan Participant was provided an election from among the
available forms of benefit regarding the manner in which such Cinergy Excess
Plan Participant's vested traditional program benefit, Part A choice benefit, Make-Whole
Account, and Supplemental Account (but only if such Cinergy Excess Plan
Participant then-participated in the cash balance program), if and as
applicable, shall be paid.  This election was subject to such terms and
conditions as the Committee specified in its sole discretion, consistent with
the terms of Notice 2007-86 and the applicable proposed and final Treasury
Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code.

paid in accordance with default rules provided under the Cinergy Excess Plan in
effect prior to December 31, 2013.  

  (b)              Supplemental Account   . 
For purposes of clarity, each Cinergy Excess Plan Participant s Supplemental
Account, if any, shall be paid:  (A) in the same form as his Make-Whole

Cinergy Excess Plan Participant prior to 2009 shall continue to be paid after
2008, in accordance with the form of benefit elected, until fully paid out.  If
a Cinergy Excess Plan Participant had a Separation from Service prior to 2009
and elected to commence the payment of his benefit under the Cinergy Non-Union
Plan prior to 2009, such election shall govern the payment of his Cinergy
Excess Plan benefit, which shall be paid at the same time and in the same form
as his benefit under the Cinergy Non-Union Plan.  

  (iii)             Available Forms of Benefit

determined pursuant to the payment provisions of the Retirement Cash Balance
Plan:  single life annuity, 100% contingent annuitant option, 66-2/3%
contingent annuitant option, 50% contingent annuitant option, and ten-year
certain and life option.   

  (C)              Part A Choice Benefit or
Part A Non-Choice Benefit   .  With respect to each Cinergy Excess Plan
Participant who is provided with an election, the same forms of benefit are
available for the Cinergy Excess Plan Participant s Part A Benefit as are
described for the traditional program, except as described below.  

  (I)            If the Cinergy Excess Plan
Participant becomes entitled to a Part A choice benefit after 2007 or Part A
automatic benefit, his Part A choice benefit or Part A automatic benefit will
be payable only in the form of a single lump sum.  

(II)           If the
Cinergy Excess Plan Participant commences the payment of his Part A choice
benefit prior to his attainment of age 50, he shall not be entitled to receive

Mid-Career Participant s entire benefit shall be paid in the form of an
annuity, from among the payment options selected by the Legacy Mid-Career

Excess Plan traditional program benefit.  Payment of the Legacy Mid-Career
Participant s benefit shall commence as of the first day of the month following
the Legacy Mid-Career Participant s Separation from Service or such later date
required by Section 6.5.  In the event that the Legacy Mid-Career Participant
dies prior to the commencement of the payment of his benefit, such benefit
shall be paid to his spouse, if any, as if such benefit were a Cinergy Excess
Plan traditional program benefit under this Section.  

  (c)              Death Benefits   .  For
purposes of Cinergy Excess Plan Part I, death benefits shall be provided in
accordance with the Cinergy Excess Plan in effect prior to January 1, 2005. 
For purposes of Cinergy Excess Plan Part II, the Plan provides the following
death benefits:  

  (I)               Traditional Program Death
Benefit   .  Upon the death of a Cinergy Excess Plan Participant under the
traditional program, if his Spouse is entitled to receive a Spouse's benefit
under the Retirement Cash Balance Plan, his Spouse will be entitled to receive
an annual benefit that is equal to the amount the Cinergy Excess Plan
Participant would have received under the Plan.  Any excess pension benefits
payable to a Spouse will be payable in equal monthly installments, each
installment being equal to 1/12th of the annual amount as determined pursuant
to this Section.  If at the date of his death a Cinergy Excess Plan Participant
had reached age 50, the first monthly installment will be payable to the
Cinergy Excess Plan Participant's Spouse on the first day of the calendar month
coincident with or following the date of the Cinergy Excess Plan Participant's
death, if his Spouse is then living.  If at the date of his death the Cinergy
Excess Plan Participant had not reached age 50, the first monthly installment
will be payable to the Cinergy Excess Plan Participant's Spouse on the first
day of the calendar month coincident with or following the date the Cinergy
Excess Plan Participant would have reached age 50, had he survived until that
date if his Spouse is then living.  In either event, subsequent monthly
installments will be payable on the first day of each month and will cease upon
the payment of the installment due on the first day of the calendar month in
which the Spouse dies.  For purposes of this Section,  Spouse  means,
with respect to any Cinergy Excess Plan Participant, the Cinergy Excess Plan
Participant's lawfully married Spouse, if any, on the applicable date.  

  (II)              Part A Death Benefit   . 
The Part A choice benefit and Part A automatic benefit for a Participant's
Spouse in the event of the Cinergy Excess Plan Participant s death shall be
determined in the same manner as the traditional program death benefit, but
only with respect to the Cinergy Excess Plan Participant's Part A choice
benefit or Part A automatic benefit respectively.  

  (III)             Make-Whole Account and
Supplemental Account Death Benefit   .  Upon a Cinergy Excess Plan Participant's
death, any remaining balance of a Cinergy Excess Plan Participant's vested
Make-Whole Account and vested Supplemental Account shall be paid as provided in
Article VII.  

   ARTICLE VII

with a form to be completed and filed with the Committee whereby the
Participant may designate a Beneficiary.   

  7.2              Failure to Designate a
Beneficiary   .  If the Participant does not designate a Beneficiary, or if

Participant, as the Participant s Beneficiary.   

  7.3              Death Prior to Commencement
of Payment   .  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.9, 6.10, and 6.11,

before payment of any Plan benefits has commenced, payments of any death
benefit shall be made to the Participant s Beneficiary in the same benefit
payment form elected by the Participant, or otherwise required, under Section
6.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Part I of the Plan only:
(i) if the Beneficiary is the estate, then the death benefit shall be paid in a
single lump sum, and (ii) if the death benefit is less than $25,000, the death
benefit shall be paid to the Participant s Beneficiary in a single lump sum.   

  7.4              Death After Commencement of
Payment   .  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.9, 6.10, and 6.11, if
a Participant should die after payment of Plan benefits has commenced, payment
of any death benefit will be made to the Participant s Beneficiary as a
continuation of the benefit payment form that had been in effect for the
Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Part I of the Plan
only, if the Beneficiary is the estate, then the death benefit shall be paid in
a single lump sum.   

  7.5              Death Benefit for Certain
Participants   .  If an Employee who was an active participant in the
Supplemental Security Plan on December 31, 1996, should die while still
employed by the Company, the portion of the death benefit attributable to the
Employee s Supplemental Account, determined after taking into account other
death benefits attributable to the elimination of the Supplemental Security
Plan, shall not be less than the amount determined by multiplying two point
five (2.5) times the annualized base rate of pay of the Employee on the date of
death.   

   ARTICLE VIII  
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION   

  The Committee retains the sole and unilateral
right to terminate, amend, modify or supplement this Plan, in whole or in part,
at any time. The Committee may delegate the right to amend the Plan, subject to
any limitations it may impose, to an officer of the Company. No such action
shall adversely affect a Participant s right to receive amounts then credited
to a Participant s account with respect to events occurring prior to the date
of such amendment. Moreover, no such action shall in any way affect a
Participant s accrued benefit or the right to payment thereof under the
provisions of Sections 6.9, 6.10, and 6.11 as in effect immediately prior to
the amendment. With respect to Part II of the Plan, subject to Section 6.5
hereof, the Committee may, in its sole discretion to the extent permitted in

of a payment under the Plan upon the termination of the Plan. In the event of a
Change in Control, the Plan shall become irrevocable and may not be amended or
terminated without the written consent of each Plan Participant who may be
affected in any way by such amendment or termination either at      

the time of such action or at any time thereafter. This
restriction in the event of a Change in Control shall be determined by
reference to the date any amendment or resolution terminating the Plan is
actually signed by an authorized party rather than the date such action
purports to be effective.   

   ARTICLE IX  
ADMINISTRATION

under Section 3(16)(B) of ERISA.   

  9.2              Plan Administrator   .  The
Committee shall have the authority to control and manage the operation and
administration of the Plan except as otherwise expressly provided in this Plan
document. The Committee may designate other persons to carry out fiduciary
responsibilities under the Plan. The Committee is the administrator of the Plan
within the meaning Section 3(16)(A) of ERISA. As administrator, the Committee
has the authority (without limitation as to other authority) to delegate its
duties to agents and to make rules and regulations that it believes are
necessary or appropriate to carry out the Plan. The Committee has the discretion
(i) to interpret and construe the terms and provisions of the Plan (including
any rules or regulations adopted under the Plan), (ii) to determine questions
of eligibility to participate in the Plan and (iii) to make factual
determinations in connection with any of the foregoing. A decision of the

and the construction or interpretation of any provision thereof, shall be
conclusive and binding upon all interested persons. Benefits under the Plan
shall be paid only if the Committee decides in its discretion that the
applicant is entitled to benefits under the Plan.   

ARTICLE X  
CLAIMS PROCEDURE   

  10.1            Claim   .  A person with an
interest in the Plan shall have the right to file a claim for benefits under
the Plan and to appeal any denial of a claim for benefits. Any request or
application for a Plan benefit or to clarify the claimant s rights to future
benefits under the terms of the Plan shall be considered to be a claim.   

  10.2            Written Claim   .  A claim
for benefits will be considered as having been made when submitted in writing
by the claimant (or by such claimant s authorized representative) to the
Committee. No particular form is required for the claim, but the written claim
must identify the name of the claimant and describe generally the benefit to
which the claimant believes he is entitled. The claim may be delivered
personally during normal business hours or mailed to the Committee.   

  10.3            Committee Determination   . 
The Committee will determine whether, or to what extent, the claim may be
allowed or denied under the terms of the Plan. If the claim is wholly or
partially denied, the claimant shall be so informed by written notice within 90
days after the day the claim is submitted unless special circumstances require
an extension of time for processing the claim. If such an extension of time for
processing is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to
the claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period. Such
extension may not exceed an additional 90 days from the end of the initial
90-day period. The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances
requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render
the final decision. If notice of denial of a claim (in whole or in part) is not
furnished within the initial 90-day period after the claim is submitted (or, if
applicable, the extended 90-day period), the claimant shall consider that his
claim has been denied just as if he had received actual notice of denial.   

  10.4            Notice of Determination   . 
The notice informing the claimant that his claim has been wholly or partially
denied shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant
and shall include: The specific reason(s) for the denial.  Specific reference
to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based.  A description of
any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect
the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary. 
Appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to
submit his claim for review.    

  10.5            Appeal   .  If the claim is
wholly or partially denied, the claimant (or his authorized representative) may
file an appeal of the denied claim with the Committee requesting that the claim
be reviewed. The Committee shall conduct a full and fair review of each
appealed claim and its denial. Unless the Committee notifies the claimant that
due to the nature of the benefit and other attendant circumstances he is
entitled to a greater period of time within which to submit his request for
review of a denied claim, the claimant shall have 60 days after he (or his
authorized representative) receives written notice of denial of his claim
within which such request must be submitted to the Committee.   

  10.6            Request for Review   .  The
request for review of a denied claim must be made in writing. In connection
with making such request, the claimant or his authorized representative may:
Review pertinent documents.  Submit issues and comments in writing.    

  10.7            Determination of Appeal   . 
The decision of the Committee regarding the appeal shall be promptly given to
the claimant in writing and shall normally be given no later than 60 days
following the receipt of the request for review. However, if special
circumstances (for example, if the Committee decides to hold a hearing on the
appeal) require a further extension of time for processing, the decision shall
be rendered as soon as possible, but no later than 120 days after receipt of
the request for review. However, if the Committee holds regularly scheduled
meetings at least quarterly, a decision on review shall be made by no later
than the date of the meeting which immediately follows the Plan s receipt of a
request for review, unless the request is filed within 30 days preceding the date
of such meeting. In such case, a decision may be made by no later than the date
of the second meeting following the Plan s receipt of the request for review.
If special circumstances (for example, if the Committee decides to hold a
hearing on the appeal) require a further extension of time for processing, the
decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but no later than the third
meeting following the Plan s receipt of the request for review. If special
circumstances require that the decision will be made beyond the initial time
for furnishing the decision, written notice of the extension shall be furnished
to the claimant (or his authorized representative) prior to the commencement of
the extension. The decision on review shall be in writing and shall be
furnished to the claimant or to his authorized representative within the
appropriate time for the decision.   

10.8            Hearing   . 
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, decide to hold a hearing if it
determines that a hearing is necessary or appropriate in order to make a full
and fair review of the appealed claim.   

  10.9            Decision   .  The decision
on review shall include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant, as well as specific references to
the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.   

  10.10          Exhaustion of Appeals   .  A
person must exhaust his rights to file a claim and to request a review of the
denial of his claim before bringing any civil action to recover benefits due to
him under the terms of the Plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the
Plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the Plan.   

  10.11          Committee s Authority   . 
The Committee shall exercise its responsibility and authority under this claims
procedure as a fiduciary and, in such capacity, shall have the discretionary
authority and responsibility (1) to interpret and construe the Plan and any
rules or regulations under the Plan, (2) to determine the eligibility of
Employees to participate in the Plan, and the rights of Participants to receive
benefits under the Plan, and (3) to make factual determinations in connection
with any of the foregoing. Benefits under the Plan shall be paid only if the
Committee decides in its discretion that the applicant is entitled to benefits
under the Plan.   

  10.12          Civil Action   .  Any civil
action brought with respect to a decision of the Committee on review shall be
brought within one year of the mailing of the written decision to the claimant.

ARTICLE XI  
NATURE OF COMPANY S OBLIGATION   

  11.1            Nature of Obligation   . 
The Company s obligation to the Participant under this Plan shall be an
unfunded and unsecured promise to pay. The rights of a Participant or
Beneficiary under this Plan shall be solely those of an unsecured general
creditor of the Company. The Company shall not be obligated under any
circumstances to set aside or hold assets to fund its financial obligations
under this Plan.   

  11.2            Financing   . 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion
establish such accounts, trusts, insurance policies or arrangements, or any
other mechanisms it deems necessary or appropriate to account for or fund its
obligations under the Plan. Any assets which the Company may set aside, acquire
or hold to help cover its financial liabilities under this Plan are and remain
general assets of the Company subject to the claims of its creditors. The
Company does not give, and the Plan does not give, any beneficial ownership
interest in any assets of the Company to a Participant or Beneficiary. All
rights of ownership in any assets are and remain in the Company. Any general
asset used or acquired by the Company in connection with the liabilities it has
assumed under this Plan shall not be deemed to be held under any trust for the
benefit of the Participant or any Beneficiary, and no general asset shall be
considered security for the performance of the obligations of the Company. Any
asset shall remain a general, unpledged, and unrestricted asset of the Company.
The Company s liability for payment of benefits shall be determined only under
the provisions of this Plan, as it may be amended from time to time.  

  Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a Change
in Control, the Company shall irrevocably set aside funds in one or more
grantor trusts, subject to the provisions of this Section 11.2, in an amount
that is sufficient to pay each Progress RRP Participant (or Spouse) the
Progress RRP benefits earned prior to 2014.  Any such trust shall be subject to
the claims of the general creditors of the Company in the event of the bankruptcy
of the Company.  The Company shall establish no such trust if the assets
thereof are includable in the income of Progress RRP Participants thereby
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.   

   ARTICLE XII  
GENERAL PROVISIONS   

  12.1            No Right to Employment   . 
Nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to give any person the right to remain in
the employ of the Company or affect the right of the Company to terminate any
Participant s employment with or without cause.   

  12.2            No Assignment   .  No right
or benefit under the Plan shall be subject to anticipation, alienation, sale,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge. Any attempt to anticipate, alienate,
sell, assign, pledge, encumber or charge these benefits shall be void. No right
or benefit under this Plan shall in any manner be liable for or subject to the
debts, contracts, liabilities, or torts of the person entitled to the benefit.
If any Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan should become bankrupt or
attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any
right to a benefit hereunder, then the right or benefit, in the discretion of
the Committee, shall cease. In these circumstances, the Committee may hold or
apply the benefit payment or payments, or any part of it, for the benefit of the
Participant or his Beneficiary, the Participant s spouse, children, or other
dependents, or any of them, in any manner and in any portion that the Committee
may deem proper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by
Section 409A of the Code and subject to Section 6.6, the Committee shall honor
a judgment, order or decree from a state domestic relations court which
requires the payment of part or all of a Participant s or Beneficiary s
interest under this Plan to an  alternate payee  as defined in Section 414(p)
of the Code.   

  12.3            Withholding   .  Any amount
required to be withheld under applicable Federal, state and local tax laws
(including any amounts required to be withheld under Section 3121(v) of the
Code) will be withheld in such manner as the Committee will determine and any
payment under the Plan will be reduced by the amount so withheld, as well as by
any other lawful withholding.   

  12.4            Governing Law   .  This Plan
shall be construed and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of
North Carolina to the extent that such laws are not preempted by Federal law.   

  12.5            Transfer of Accounts   . 
The Make-Whole Account and Supplemental Account, if any, of each Spectra Energy
Participant maintained under the Plan immediately prior to the Distribution
Date shall be transferred to the Spectra Energy Corp Executive Cash Balance
Plan and assumed by Spectra Energy Corp as of the Distribution Date. Each such
Spectra Energy Participant shall have no further rights under the Plan
immediately after his Make-Whole Account and Supplemental Account, if any, are
transferred to the Spectra Energy Corp Executive Cash Balance Plan and assumed
by Spectra Energy Corp in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Employee Matters Agreement by and between Duke Energy Corporation and      

Spectra Energy Corp (the  Employee Matters Agreement ).
Capitalized terms used in this Section 12.5 that are not defined in this Plan
shall have the meaning set forth in the Employee Matters Agreement.   

  12.6            Compliance with Section 409A
of the Code   .  It is intended that Part II of the Plan comply with the
provisions of Section 409A of the Code, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross
income of any amounts deferred hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the
taxable year or years in which such amounts would otherwise actually be paid or
made available to Participants or Beneficiaries. This Plan shall be construed,
administered, and governed in a manner that effects such intent, and the
Company shall not take any action that would be inconsistent with such intent.
Although the Company shall use its best efforts to avoid the imposition of
taxation, interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code, the tax
treatment of deferrals under this Plan is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither
the Company, the other members of the Affiliated Group, their respective
directors, officers, employees and advisors, the Board, nor any committee shall
be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts
owed by any Participant, Beneficiary or other taxpayer as a result of the Plan.
Any reference in this Plan to Section 409A of the Code will also include any
proposed, temporary or final regulations, or any other guidance, promulgated
with respect to such Section 409A of the Code by the U.S. Department of
Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service. For purposes of the Plan, the phrase
 permitted by Section 409A of the Code,  or words or phrases of similar import,
shall mean that the event or circumstance shall only be permitted to the extent
it would not cause an amount deferred or payable under the Plan to be
includible in the gross income of a Participant or Beneficiary under Section
409A(a)(1) of the Code.   

  12.7            Electronic or Other Media   . 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, including any
provision that requires the use of a written instrument, the Committee may
establish procedures for the use of electronic or other media in communications
and transactions between the Plan or the Committee and Participants and
Beneficiaries. Electronic or other media may include, but are not limited to,
e-mail, the Internet, intranet systems and automated telephonic response
systems.   

  This amendment and restatement of the Plan
has been executed on behalf of the Company this ___________ day of December,
2013.

Progress Nonqualified Plan Participants (or their Eligible Spouses or
Beneficiaries).   

   1.             Normal Retirement Benefit   .  A Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participant who incurs a Separation from Service on or after
his Progress Normal Retirement Date shall be eligible for the normal retirement
benefit, which is a monthly amount equal to his Target Normal Retirement
Benefit reduced by the sum of (a) his Assumed Normal Retirement Pension Benefit
and (b) his Social Security Benefit.   

   2.             Early Retirement Benefit   .  A Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participant who incurs a Separation from Service upon or
after his attainment of age 55 with at least 15 years of Service (except for
purposes of calculating benefits payable under Paragraph 3 and 4 of this
Exhibit A below, as applicable) but prior to his Progress Normal Retirement
Date, shall be eligible for the early retirement benefit, which is a monthly
amount equal to his Target Early Retirement Benefit reduced by the sum of (a)
his Assumed Early Retirement Pension Benefit and (b) his Social Security
Benefit; provided, however, such benefit will be reduced, where applicable, by
the following: (i) the amount of 2.5% for each year that such benefit is
received prior to his Progress Normal Retirement Date, and (ii) if such
eligible Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s projected years of Service at
his Progress Normal Retirement Date are less than 15, his Target Early
Retirement Benefit and his Assumed Early Retirement Pension Benefit shall be
calculated based upon his actual years of Service at his Progress Early
Retirement Date rather than upon his projected years of Service at his Progress
Normal Retirement Date.   

   3.             Deferred Vested Benefit   .  A Progress Nonqualified
Plan Participant who incurs a Separation from Service after completing 10 or
more years of Service but who is not eligible for a retirement benefit under
Paragraph 1 or 2 of this Exhibit A shall be eligible for one of the following
benefits: (a) if at Separation from Service the Progress Nonqualified Plan
Participant is not entitled to a deferred vested Progress Qualified Retirement
Pension under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan or an early retirement
Progress Qualified Retirement Pension under the Progress Qualified Retirement
Plan, his deferred vested benefit shall be a monthly amount equal to his Target
Deferred Vested Benefit reduced by his Social Security Benefit; (b) if at
Separation from Service such eligible Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant is
entitled to a deferred vested Progress Qualified Retirement Pension under the
Progress Qualified Retirement Plan, his deferred vested benefit shall be a
monthly amount equal to his Target Deferred Vested Benefit reduced by the sum
of (i) his Assumed Deferred Vested Pension Benefit and (ii) his Social Security
Benefit; (c) if at his Separation from Service such eligible Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participant is entitled to an early retirement Progress
Qualified Retirement Pension pursuant to Section 5.02 of the Progress Qualified
Retirement Plan, his deferred vested benefit shall be a monthly amount equal to
his Target Deferred Vested Benefit reduced by the sum of (a) his Assumed Early
Retirement Pension Benefit and (b) his Social Security Benefit; provided,
however, such Assumed Early Retirement Pension Benefit shall be calculated at
his Separation from Service as provided in this Exhibit A, but without regard
to projected pay credits, and, if applicable, projected transition credits.   

   4.             Definitions   .  For purposes of
Section 6.9, this Exhibit A, and sections expressly stated, the following terms
shall have the following meanings unless a different meaning is clearly
required by the context:   

   Assumed
Deferred Vested Pension Benefit   .  Shall mean the monthly benefit of the
deferred vested Progress Qualified Retirement Pension to commence on his
Progress Normal Retirement Date payable in the form of an annuity to which a
separated Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant would be entitled under the
Progress Qualified Retirement Plan, calculated with the following assumptions
based on such Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s marital status at the
time benefits hereunder commence: (a) In the case of a Progress Nonqualified
Plan Participant with an Eligible Spouse, in the form of a 50% Qualified Joint
and Survivor Annuity as provided in the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan. (b)

option under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan.   

   Assumed
Early Retirement Pension Benefit   .  Shall mean the monthly benefit of the
normal retirement Progress Qualified Retirement Pension payable in the form of
an annuity to which a Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant would be entitled
under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan projected at his Progress Normal
Retirement Date based on the following:   

  (I)            The
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s account balance under the Progress
Qualified Retirement Plan is determined at the time of the Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participant s actual Separation from Service. The foregoing
is increased by (i) the pay credits and, if applicable, transition credits,
that the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant would have received from his
actual Separation from Service through his Progress Normal Retirement Date
using the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s rate of compensation at his
actual Separation from Service (or, if compensation under the Progress
Qualified Retirement Plan includes variable compensation, then compensation for
the calendar year prior to his actual Separation from Service) and the pay
credit table in effect at his actual Separation from Service and (ii) interest
credits in accordance with the rate schedule (or, if applicable, variable rate)
in effect on the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s actual Separation
from Service    

  (II)           The
amount determined in (I) above is adjusted based upon the Progress Nonqualified

Eligible Spouse, in the form of a 50% Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity as
provided in the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan. (b) In the case of a
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant without an Eligible Spouse, in the form
of a Single Life Annuity as provided in the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan.

Qualified Retirement Plan.    

   Assumed
Normal Retirement Pension Benefit   . Shall mean the monthly benefit of the
normal retirement Progress Qualified Retirement Pension payable in the form of
an annuity to which a Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant would be entitled
under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan if he retired at his Progress
Normal Retirement Date, calculated with the following assumptions based on his
marital status at the time benefits hereunder commence: (a) In the case of a
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant with an Eligible Spouse, in the form of
a 50% Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity as provided in the Progress Qualified
Retirement Plan. (b) In the case of a Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant
without an Eligible Spouse, in the form of a Single Life Annuity as provided in
the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan. (c) Without regard to any other benefit
payment option under the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan.

the balance in the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s Make-Whole Benefit
Account and Supplemental Benefit Account attributable to pay and supplemental
credits made from July 2, 2012 until Separation from Service) determined at the
time payment actually occurs under Section 6.9(b), actuarially adjusted to the
payment form in which the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s Frozen
Progress Nonqualified Plan Benefit is payable at commencement (for purposes of
clarity, single life annuity, single life annuity with 120 monthly payments
guaranteed, or 50% Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, as applicable). Any
actuarial adjustment shall be determined using the mortality and interest
assumptions under the Duke Energy Retirement Cash Balance Plan as in effect
from time to time for converting the cash balance account to a form of payment.
For purposes of clarity, note that, as of July 2, 2012, the Duke Energy
Retirement Cash Balance Plan uses the applicable mortality table as defined in
Section 417(e)(3) of the Code and the applicable interest rate as provided in
Section 417(e) of the Code for the month of August prior to the beginning of
the year during which commencement is to occur to convert the cash balance to a
single life annuity and uses the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table weighted
50% male and 50% female and 7% interest compounded annually to convert the
single life annuity to other optional forms of payment.   

   Eligible
Spouse   .
Shall mean the spouse of a Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant who, under
the laws of the State where the marriage was contracted, is deemed married to
that Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant on the date on which the payments
from this Plan are to begin to the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant,
except that, for purposes of Section 6.9(c) and (d), Eligible Spouse shall mean
a person who is married to a Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant for a
period of at least one year prior to his death. For purposes of applying
Sections 6.8, 11.1, 11.2, 12.2 and 12.6 of the Plan, an Eligible Spouse of a
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant shall be deemed to be that Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participant s  Beneficiary .

in the Progress Qualified Retirement Plan.   

   Final
Average Salary   .

Salary (as defined below) during the 36 completed calendar months of highest

determining average monthly Progress Salary (i) annual incentives and other
similar payments shall be deemed received in twelve (12) equal payments beginning
with the eleventh preceding month and ending with the month such payments were
actually made (for purposes of clarity, the payment must actually have been
made prior to July 2, 2012 for such payment to be included in determining Final
Average Salary), and (ii) amounts of compensation deferred under any deferred
compensation plan or arrangement shall be deemed received in the months such
payments would have been received assuming no deferral had occurred. For years
of Service granted under the terms of a written employment agreement, Progress
Salary during each such month is deemed to be zero dollars ($0.00) for purposes
of calculating Final Average Salary. Solely for purposes of determining a
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s Minimum Progress Nonqualified Plan
Benefit under Section 6.9(a)(ii) and the Target Pre-Retirement Death Benefit
determined as of the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s actual date of
death under Section 6.9(d)(ii), the Final Average Salary (as determined above)
shall be increased by the increase in the Consumer Price Index  Urban Wage
Earners and Clerical Workers ( CPI-W ) for the period from July 2, 2012 to the
earliest to occur of the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s death,
Separation from Service, Progress Early Retirement Date, or Progress Normal
Retirement Date, whichever is applicable.   

   Frozen
Progress Nonqualified Plan Benefit   .  Shall mean the Normal Retirement Benefit,
Early Retirement Benefit or Deferred Vested Benefit, as applicable, determined
under Paragraph 1, 2 or 3, as applicable, of this Exhibit A as if the Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participant incurred a Separation from Service as of July 2,
2012, subject, however, to the following:   

  (I)            If the
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant is eligible for an Early Retirement
Benefit under Paragraph 2 of Exhibit A at the time that the Progress
Nonqualified Plan Participant s benefit commences, the reduction (if any) for
commencement prior to the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s 65th
birthday shall be determined as provided in Exhibit A at the time that the
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s benefit commences.    

  (II)           The
Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s marital status (and payment form)
shall be determined at the time that the Progress Nonqualified Plan

purposes of clarity, the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s Final Average
Salary, Service, Social Security Benefit, and, except to the extent provided in

at July 2, 2012 and as adjusted for cost of living from July 2, 2012 to the
earliest to occur of the Progress Nonqualified Plan Participant s death,
Separation from Service, Progress Early Retirement Date, or Progress Normal

  (III)          The

provided that the election is made at least twelve months in advance of the
earliest date at which the forfeiture condition could lapse.  For this purpose,
a condition will not be treated as failing to require the Participant to
continue to provide services for a period of at least twelve months merely
because the condition immediately lapses upon the death or disability (as
defined in Section 409A of the Code) of the Participant, or upon a change in
control (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), provided that if such death,
disability, or change in control occurs and the condition lapses before the end
of such twelve-month period, the Deferral Election made under this Section
4.3(b) shall not apply to such compensation.  

  (c)              Performance-Based
Compensation   .  To the extent permitted by the Company, and notwithstanding
anything contained in this Section to the contrary, the Deferral Election with
respect to an LTIP Award that constitutes Performance-Based Compensation must
be made by, and shall become irrevocable as of, the date that is six months
before the end of the applicable performance period (or such earlier date as
specified by the Committee on the Deferral Election), provided that in no event
may such Deferral Election be made after such LTIP Award has become  readily
ascertainable  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  In order to
make a Deferral Election under this Section 4.3(c), the Participant must
perform services continuously from the later of the beginning of the
performance period or the date the performance criteria are established through
the date a Deferral Election becomes irrevocable under this Section 4.3(c).  An
election made under this Section 4.3(c) shall not apply to any portion of the
Performance-Based Compensation that is actually earned by a Participant
regardless of satisfaction of the performance criteria.  

  (d)              Crediting Date   .  Upon
the date that an LTIP Award that the Participant has elected to defer otherwise
would have been payable, the number of shares of stock or the cash payment that
would have become so payable but for the Deferral Election shall be credited to
the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount.  

  (e)              Dividend Equivalents   . 
Dividend equivalents, to the extent deferred, shall also be deferred and
credited to the Participant s Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals
Subaccount commencing on the payment date of the first cash dividend of the
Company s common stock that is declared after the date on which the deferred
LTIP Award vests.  

  4.4              Dividend Equivalents
Deferrals   .  Each eligible Participant may irrevocably elect to defer, in
accordance with the terms of this Plan, 100% of the amounts that would
otherwise become payable as dividend equivalents, with respect to an LTIP Award
with respect to which the LTIP Award agreement specifically provides for the
deferral of dividend equivalents.  Such election must be made by the
Participant at the time the Participant elects to defer receipt of the related
LTIP Award pursuant to the terms of Section 4.3.  Dividend equivalents that
have been deferred shall be credited to the Participant s Duke Energy Common
Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount as of the dates such amounts would otherwise
become payable pursuant to such LTIP Award.  

  4.5              Retirement Savings Plan -
Excess Matching Contribution   .  The Company maintains the RSP, pursuant to
which Employees are permitted to make certain contributions with respect to
which the Company makes matching contributions, based on the Employee s
contribution election.  It is the Company s intention to provide matching
contribution credits under this Plan where matching contributions cannot be
provided under the RSP due to:  (i) the application of Section 401(a)(17) of
the Code, (ii) the application of Section 402(g) of the Code or (iii) the
application of Section 415 of the Code.  Accordingly, during the first 90 days
following each Plan Year, but only with respect to Participants who are
eligible for such contributions as described below, the Participant s Account
shall receive a credit (the  Company Matching Contribution ) equal to the
amount, if any, by which the lesser of the amounts in subparagraph (a) or (b)
below, exceeds the amount in subparagraph (c) below; provided, however, that no
such Company Matching Contribution shall be made if it relates to compensation
attributable to services performed prior to the date that the distribution
option election (or the default payment form) for that contribution becomes
irrevocable.  A Participant only shall be eligible for Company Matching
Contributions for a Plan Year if (i) he or she was eligible to participate in
the Plan during such Plan Year and (ii) was employed by the Affiliated Group as
of the last day of such Plan Year.    

  (a)           The maximum matching
contribution the Participant was eligible to receive for the Plan Year under
the RSP based upon the Participant s eligible compensation thereunder for the
Plan Year, but determined without regard to the limitations of Code Section
401(a)(17) and any Base Pay deferrals and Incentive Plan deferrals pursuant to
Sections 4.1 and 4.2.  

  (b)           The Participant s eligible
deferrals and contributions under the RSP for the Plan Year plus the
Participant s Base Pay deferrals and Incentive Plan deferrals credited to the
Participant s Account during the Plan Year pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.2.  

(c)           The
Matching Contribution credited to the Participant s account under the RSP for
the Plan Year.  

  4.6              Retirement Savings Plan -
Employer Retirement Contribution   .  The Company maintains the RSP, pursuant
to which certain employees are eligible to receive employer retirement
contributions in the amount of 4% of eligible compensation thereunder, up to
the compensation limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code.  It is the
Company s intention to provide employer retirement contribution credits under
this Plan where employer retirement contributions cannot be provided under the
RSP due to:  (i) the application of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code or (ii) the
application of Section 415 of the Code.  Accordingly, on a payroll period
basis, the Participant s Employer Retirement Subaccount shall receive a credit
(the  Employer Retirement Contribution ) equal to the amount, if any, by which
the amount in subparagraph (a) below exceeds the amount in subparagraph (b)
below.  Each Participant's Employer Retirement Subaccount shall be fully vested
and non-forfeitable at all times.  

                  (a)           The maximum
employer retirement contribution the Participant was eligible to receive for
such payroll period under the RSP based upon the Participant s eligible
compensation thereunder for the Plan Year, but determined without regard to the
limitations of Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code.    

                  (b)           The employer
retirement contribution made to the Participant s account under the RSP for
such payroll period.  

  4.7              Other Company Contributions   . 
The Company may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, direct that a
special credit in such amount as the Company shall determine be made to a
specified Participant s Account in order to (i) mitigate an unintended
shortfall in a Company contribution, or (ii) implement provisions of an
employment agreement.  A special credit may be awarded subject to such vesting
requirement as the Company shall determine (provided that upon a Change in
Control, any special credit shall become vested if the affected Participant has
not previously incurred a Separation from Service) and, notwithstanding any
provision of this Plan to the contrary, to the extent any such special credit
has not become vested, it shall not be paid under the Plan.  

  4.8              Elections   .  Unless
otherwise specified by the Committee in accordance with procedures established
from time to time, an election to defer Base Pay, Incentive Plan compensation
and LTIP Awards shall apply only with respect to the compensation to which such
election specifically relates, and such Deferral Election cannot be revoked. 
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, cancel a Participant s Deferral
Election due to an Unforeseeable Emergency or a hardship distribution pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3).  

   ARTICLE V 
FORMER PLANS AND TRANSITION RULES   

  5.1              Prior Plans   .  As
described in more detail in Appendix A, the Plan governs the terms and
conditions of all or a portion of the amounts previously earned under the
following plans (each a  Prior Plan ):  (i) the Duke Power Company Compensation
Deferral Plan, first effective as of July 1, 1983 ( CDP ), (ii) the Panhandle
Eastern Corporation Key Executive Deferred Compensation Plan as amended and
restated January 1, 1996 ( KEDCP ), (iii) the Crescent Resources Incentive
Deferral Plan ( CRIDP ), (iv) the Company s Supplementary Defined Contribution
Plan, (v) the Company s Incentive Deferral Plan, (vi) the Cinergy Corp. 401(k)

the Progress Energy, Inc. Management Deferred Compensation Plan, (x) the
Progress Energy, Inc. Management Incentive Compensation Plan, and (xi) the
Progress Energy, Inc. Executive and Key Manager Performance Share Sub-Plans. 
For purposes of clarity, the Plan is the successor to the Duke Energy
Corporation Executive Savings Plan I and the Duke Energy Corporation Executive
Savings Plan II.  Amounts that were previously payable under the Prior Plans
and that have been credited to Accounts hereunder shall remain subject to the
same vesting schedule and elections (including deferral and distribution
elections) and beneficiary designations that were controlling under the
applicable Prior Plan immediately prior to the date such amounts were credited
to Accounts under the Plan until a new election is made in accordance with the
terms of this Plan that by its terms supersedes the prior election.  This Plan
shall recognize any amount that was properly deferred by a Participant under a
Prior Plan but that had not yet been credited to his or her account thereunder
as of the date the obligations under such plan were assumed by this Plan.  Each
Participant s right to receive any benefit that has been transferred to this
Plan shall be determined solely pursuant to the terms of this Plan.  All of the
Company s obligations and Participants  rights with respect to the amounts
previously payable under the Prior Plan shall automatically be extinguished and
become obligations and rights under this Plan without further action as of the
applicable effective date set forth on Exhibit A.    

  5.2              Application of Code Section
409A to Prior Plans   .   

  (a)              Pre-2005 Deferrals   .  Any
 amounts deferred  in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2005 under the
Plan or Prior Plan, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and any
earnings thereon ( Pre-2005 Deferrals ), shall be governed by the terms of the
Plan or Prior Plan, as applicable, as in effect on October 3, 2004, and it is
intended that such amounts and any earnings thereon be exempt from the
application of Section 409A of the Code.  Nothing contained herein is intended
to materially enhance a benefit or right existing under the Plan or Prior Plan
as of October 3, 2004 or add a new material benefit or right to such Plan or
Prior Plan.  

  (b)              Post-2004 Deferrals   . 
Any  amounts deferred  in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005
under the Plan or Prior Plan, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code,
and any earnings thereon ( Post-2004 Deferrals ), shall be governed by the
terms and conditions of the Plan.  

   ARTICLE VI 
ACCOUNTS   

  6.1              Maintenance of Participant
Accounts   .  An Account shall be established and maintained with respect to
each Participant.  Each Account shall reflect the amounts credited thereto
pursuant to Article IV and V, plus or minus adjustments made in accordance with
the provisions of this Article VI and reduced by distributions made in
accordance with Article VII.  

  6.2              Phantom Investment Options   . 
In accordance with such rules as the Committee shall approve, Investment

accordance with this Section and rules established by the Committee, the
 investment  of his or her Account in one or more Investment Options hereunder,
and may elect to transfer his or her Account among such Investment Options. 
The Participant s Account shall thereafter be automatically adjusted daily (or
on such other basis as the Committee shall approve), upward or downward, in
proportion to the total percentage return experienced for the respective period
on amounts invested in the Investment Options.  Accounts under the Plan      

shall be bookkeeping accounts reflecting units of phantom
Investment Options hereunder which mirror the performance that would have
resulted from an actual investment in the corresponding Investment Option(s). 
No amounts actually shall be invested hereunder in any Investment Option. 
Effective as of January 1, 2014, the portion (if any) of each Participant s
Account that was credited to the Spectra Common Stock Fund was automatically
reallocated to the U.S. Equity S P 500 Index Fund Investment Option, and the
Spectra Common Stock Fund is no longer available as an Investment Option under
the Plan.    

  6.3              Subaccounts   .

performance of the Company s common stock (with cash dividends reinvested).  No
transfers may be made into or out of the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock
Deferrals Subaccount.  

  (c)              CDP Subaccounts   .  The
amounts originally credited under the CDP and transferred to a Participant s
Account pursuant to Section 5.1 shall be maintained in one or two separate
phantom Investment Option subaccounts (the  CDP Subaccounts ), and shall
continue to be credited with interest at one of two fixed rate(s) (i.e., 10.5%
or 17.5%) formerly applicable to such accounts under the CDP.  At any time the
Participant may elect to transfer any amount from such CDP Subaccounts to
another Investment Option in the Participant s General Account, but no amount
so removed from the CDP Subaccounts may be transferred back to such CDP
Subaccounts.  

  (d)              Legacy Cinergy Subaccounts   . 
The amounts originally credited under the Legacy Cinergy Plans and transferred
to a Participant s Account pursuant to Section 5.1 shall be maintained in separate
subaccounts hereunder (the  Legacy Cinergy Subaccounts ).  Amounts credited to

The amounts originally credited under the Legacy Progress Plans and transferred
to a Participant s Account pursuant to Section 5.1 shall be maintained in
separate subaccounts hereunder (the  Legacy Progress Subaccounts ).  Amounts
credited to the Legacy Progress Plans that are required to remain invested in
an Investment Option that mirrors the performance of the Company s common stock
shall be transferred to the Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount.  

  (g)              Employer Retirement
Subaccount   .  Amounts contributed to a Participant s Account as an Employer
Retirement Contribution pursuant to Section 4.6 shall be held in a subaccount
within such Participant s Account (the  Employer Retirement Subaccount ).    

  6.4              Adjustments to Stock Funds   . 
If there shall occur any merger, consolidation, liquidation, issuance of rights
or warrants to purchase securities, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, spin-off, split-off, stock split, reverse stock split or other
distribution with respect to the shares of the Company, or any similar
corporate transaction or event in respect of such shares, then the Committee
shall, in the manner and to the extent that it deems appropriate and equitable
to the Participants and consistent with the terms of this Plan, cause a
proportionate adjustment to be made in number and kind of shares deemed held
under the Plan.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the
Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for any or all
outstanding shares under the Plan such alternative consideration as it, in good
faith, may determine to be equitable under the circumstances.  

   ARTICLE VII 
BENEFITS   

  7.1              Separation from Service   .   

  (a)              General Rule   .  Upon the
Participant s Separation from Service, for any reason, the amount in the
Participant s Account shall be paid to the Participant (or to the Beneficiary
designated pursuant to Section 8.1) in accordance with the terms of the
distribution option elected by the Participant under Section 5.1 or this
Article, except as otherwise provided in this Article.  

  (b)              Participants Who Are Not
Retirement Eligible - Pre-2005 Deferrals   .  Notwithstanding the above, if a
Participant (i) has a Separation from Service for any reason, except death,

under the Duke Energy Retirement Cash Balance Plan as in effect on October 3,
2004, without giving effect to amendments adopted thereafter, and (ii) has
elected term payments of 10 years or 15 years, then the portion of that
Participant s Account that is comprised of Pre-2005 Deferrals shall be paid
instead for a 3-year term in accordance with Section 7.3(b).  

7.2              Election of Distribution
Option   .   

  (a)              Pre-2005 Deferrals   . 
With respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals, each Participant has been provided the
opportunity to elect from among the distribution options specified in Section
7.3, the manner in which such Participant s Account shall be paid following
Separation from Service.  A Participant may change his or her distribution
option to a distribution option permitted under Section 7.3 by completing a new
election form and delivering it to the Committee.  A Participant s election to
change the form of benefit payment shall become effective one year from the
date on which the election form was submitted to the Committee, but only if the
Participant has remained an Employee throughout such one year period.  A
Participant      

may not elect to change the distribution
form or commencement date  applicable to his or her CRIDP Subaccount or the
portion of the Legacy Progress Subaccount attributable to deferrals under the
Progress Energy, Inc. Executive and Key Manager Performance Share Sub-Plans. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing:  

  (i)               Progress Energy, Inc.
Management Deferred Compensation Plan   .  With respect to the portion of the
Legacy Progress Subaccount attributable to Pre-2005 Deferrals under the
Progress Energy, Inc. Management Deferred Compensation Plan, a Participant may
elect at least one year prior to the applicable payment commencement date
(which was originally elected on a class-year basis), and on a form provided by
the Company, a new payment commencement date that either is five years from the
then current payment commencement date or otherwise is permitted under  Section
7.3(e)(i)(A)(II) or (III).  Only one such new election will be permitted with
respect to the Participant s Pre-2005 Deferrals relating to a particular class
year.  In addition, the Participant may elect, on a form provided by the
Committee, to change the form of  distribution to any of the forms permitted
under Section 7.3(e)(i)(B) with respect to such Pre-2005 Deferrals at least one
year prior to the applicable payment commencement date for such accounts.  

  (b)              Post-2004 Deferrals   . 
With respect to each amount deferred under the Plan after 2007, each

by the Committee and no later than the last day for filing the Deferral
Election to which such deferrals relate, be entitled to make a separate
class-year election from among the distribution options specified in Section
7.4.  With respect to all amounts deferred under the Plan after 2004 and before
2008, each Participant has been provided, in accordance with procedures
established from time to time by the Committee consistent with Section 7.10,
the opportunity to make a single election (which may be separate for LTIP Award
deferrals and all other amounts) from among the distribution options specified
in Section 7.4.  A Participant may not elect to change such elections.  With
respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, each Participant under the Legacy Progress
Plans has been provided the opportunity to make a separate class-year election
from among the payment commencement date and form of payment options specified
in Section 7.4(e).  A Participant may not elect to change such elections.  

  7.3              Distribution Options for
Pre-2005 Deferrals   .  Subject to the foregoing, the following distribution
options are available with respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals:

the full amount of the Participant s Account on the first business day of the
month following the month in which Separation from Service occurs.  

  (b)              Term Payments   .  Payments
on a monthly basis over a term of years, which shall be either 3 years, 10
years, or 15 years, as follows:  The Company shall determine the amount of the
Participant s Account on the Valuation Date, and as of the first business day
of each month thereafter.  The Participant shall receive on the first business
day of each month during the term, beginning with the first business day of the
month following the Valuation Date, an amount determined pursuant to the
following formula:  

amount  

=  

V    
  N  

where  

N  

represents
  the number of months remaining in the term (including the month for which the
  payment is being calculated) and  

V  

represents
  the amount of the Participant s Account as of the date the payment is being
  calculated.  

Any
remaining balance in the Participant s Account shall be paid to the Participant
on the first business day of the last month of the term.  Distributions from
the Participant s Duke Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount shall
be on an annual, rather than a monthly basis, and the formula set forth above
shall be reformed accordingly.  Term payments from the Duke Energy Common Stock
- Stock Deferrals Subaccount shall be made on the first business day of the
month immediately following each anniversary of the Valuation Date.  

  (c)              Legacy Cinergy Plans   .

Legacy Cinergy Plans shall be payable only in a lump sum payment or in
substantially equal annual installments over a specified number of whole years
from 2 to 10 years.  Distribution of the Participant s Account shall commence
no later than 30 days after Separation from Service.  Subsequent installments
shall be payable on or as soon as administratively practicable following each
anniversary of the payment commencement date.  If a Participant failed to make
an election under the terms of the applicable Legacy Cinergy Plan and this
Plan, the portion of his or her Account attributable to Pre-2005 Deferrals
under such applicable Legacy Cinergy Plan shall be distributed in five
substantially equal annual installments commencing no later than 30 days after
Separation from Service.  

  (d)              CRIDP   .  Notwithstanding
Section 7.3(a) and (b), all amounts in the CRIDP Subaccounts shall be payable
only in accordance with a Participant s original distribution election, in
annual installments commencing as soon as practicable following the date on
which the Participant has a Separation from Service and ending no later than
the fifteenth anniversary of such date.  

  (e)              Legacy Progress Plans   . 
Notwithstanding Section 7.1(b) and Section 7.3(a) and (b), Pre-2005 Deferrals
attributable to the Legacy Progress Plans shall be payable as follows:

Management Deferred Compensation Plan   . With respect to the portion of the
Legacy Progress Subaccounts attributable to deferrals under the Progress
Energy, Inc. Management Deferred Compensation Plan, Participants had the
opportunity to elect with respect to each Plan Year to (A) defer the payment
until (I) the April 1 following the date that is five years from the last day

extending from two years to ten years (by paying a fraction of the account
balance each year during such period), as elected by the Participant. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the Separation from Service of a
Participant for any reason, prior to Retirement or death, such amounts shall be
paid following Separation from Service in a lump sum.  In all cases, payment
shall commence no later than 30 days after the payment commencement date.       

For this purpose,  Retirement  shall mean a Participant s
Separation from Service on or after attaining either age 65 with 5 years of
service,  age 55 with 15 years of service, 35 years of service, or eligibility
for retirement under the Supplemental Senior Executive Retirement Plan of
Progress Energy, Inc. if covered under such plan.  

  (ii)              Progress Energy, Inc.
Management Incentive Compensation Plan   . With respect to the portion of the
Legacy Progress Subaccounts attributable to deferral of awards under the
Progress Energy, Inc. Management Incentive Compensation Plan, Participants had
the opportunity to elect with respect to each Plan Year to (A) defer the
payment of an award until (I) any date that is at least five years subsequent
to the date the award would otherwise be payable, but not later than the second
anniversary of the Participant s Retirement, or (II) any date that is within
two years following the Participant s Retirement; and (B) provide for the
payment of such deferred awards in the form of a lump sum or approximately
equal annual installments over a period extending from two years to ten years
(with the amount of the annual payment determined by dividing the balance in
the Participant s Subaccount by the total remaining number of annual payments
to be received by the Participant).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event of the Separation from Service of a Participant for any reason, prior to
the Retirement or death of the Participant, such amounts shall be paid in a
lump sum following the Separation from Service.  With respect to the portion of
the Legacy Progress Subaccounts attributable to  incentive performance units 
(as defined in the Progress Energy, Inc. Management Incentive Compensation
Plan), the following rules shall apply:  the incentive performance units shall
be forfeited by the Participant if he or she terminates employment either
voluntarily or involuntarily other than for death or Retirement prior to five
years from March 15 of the year in which payment would have been made if the
award had not been deferred; provided, however, that if before such date the
employment of the Participant is terminated by the Company without Cause, the
incentive performance units shall not be forfeited but shall be payable to the
Participant in a single lump sum following separation.  In all cases, payment
shall commence no later than 30 days after the payment commencement date.  For
this purpose,  Retirement  shall mean a Participant s Separation from Service on
or after attaining either age 65 with 5 years of service, age 55 with 15 years
of service, or 35 years of service.  

  (iii)             Progress Energy, Inc.
Executive and Key Manager Performance Share Sub-Plans   . With respect to the
portion of the Legacy Progress Subaccounts attributable to deferrals under the
Progress Energy, Inc. Executive and Key Manager Performance Share Sub-Plans,
Participants had the opportunity to elect with respect to each Plan Year to (A)
defer the payment until (I) the April 1 following the date that is at least
five years from the last day of such Plan Year (provided that if the
Participant Retires prior to the scheduled payment date, the payment shall
instead be made no later than April 1 following the first anniversary of the
Participant s Retirement), (II) the April 1 following the Participant s
Retirement, or (III) the April 1 following the first anniversary of the
Participant s Retirement; and (B) provide for the payment of such Plan Year
deferrals in the form of a lump sum or approximately equal annual installments
over a period extending from two years to five years (by paying a fraction of
the account balance each year during such period), as elected by the
Participant.  In the event of the Separation from Service of a Participant for
any reason other than the death, Disability or Retirement of the Participant,
the vested amounts shall be paid following separation in a lump sum.   In all
cases, payment shall commence no later than 30 days after the payment
commencement date.   For purposes of this Section 7.3(e)(iii),  Retirement 
shall mean (x) for performance shares granted prior to 1999, a Participant s
Separation from Service on or after attaining either age 65, age 55 with 15
years of service, or 35 years of service, and (y) for performance shares

Participant s Retirement, for performance shares granted prior to 2005, and on
the later of the April 1 following the first anniversary of Retirement or the
April 1 of the year following the end of the applicable performance period, for
performance shares granted during and after 2005), (II) the April 1 following
the Participant s Retirement, or (III) the April 1 following the first
anniversary of the Participant s Retirement; and (B) provide for the payment of
such Plan Year deferrals in the form of a lump sum or approximately equal
annual installments over a period extending from two years to five years (by

  7.5              Payments After Death   . 
If a Participant (or a Beneficiary previously designated by a deceased
Participant) dies before receiving all amounts payable hereunder, then the
remaining amounts payable shall be paid to the specified Beneficiary of such
deceased person in accordance with the distribution option in effect, but
subject to Section 7.6;  provided, however, that with respect to the portion of
the Legacy Progress Subaccounts attributable to deferrals under the Progress Energy,
Inc. Management Deferred Compensation Plan, and Post-2004 Deferrals under the
Progress Energy, Inc. Management Incentive Compensation Plan, the remaining
amounts shall be paid to the specified Beneficiary in a single lump sum within
60 days after death.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Pre-2005
Deferrals (other than those attributable to the Legacy Cinergy Plans and the
Progress Legacy Plans), if a person receiving payments over a term of years
dies and an estate is such person s Beneficiary, then such term payments shall
cease and the remaining amount credited to the Account shall be paid to such
estate in a single lump sum within 60 days after the date of death.   

   7.6             Small Payments   .  If the
portion of a Participant s Account balance attributable to Pre-2005 Deferrals,
other than amounts in the Legacy Cinergy Subaccounts and the Legacy Progress

  7.7              Form of Payment   .  All
amounts due under the Plan shall be paid in cash, except that units in the Duke
Energy Common Stock - Stock Deferrals Subaccount shall be converted to whole
shares of the Company s common stock and cash for any fractional share.  To the
extent that the delivery of any shares of the Company s common stock to a
Participant under this Plan otherwise would cause all or any portion of the
Plan to be considered an  equity compensation plan  as such term is defined in
Section 303A(8) of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual or any
successor rule ( Listed Company Manual ), then such shares shall be paid from,
and shall count against the share reserve of, a Company-sponsored  equity
compensation plan  designated by the Committee that complies with the
shareholder approval requirements contained in the Listed Company Manual.   

7.8              Acceleration
of Payment in the Event of Unforeseeable Emergency   .  A Participant shall
have the right to request, on a form provided by the Committee, an accelerated
payment of all or a portion of his or her Account in a lump sum if he or she
experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency.  The Committee shall have the sole
discretion to determine, in accordance with the standards and to the extent it
would not result in a material modification of Pre-2005 Deferrals under Section
409A of the Code, whether to grant such a request and the amount to be paid
pursuant to such request.  Whether a Participant is faced with an Unforeseeable
Emergency permitting a payment under this Section is to be determined based on
the relevant facts and circumstances of each case, but, in any case, a payment
on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency may not be made to the extent that
such emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from
insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant s assets, to the
extent the liquidation of such assets would not cause severe financial
hardship, or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan.   Payments because of an
Unforeseeable Emergency must be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to
satisfy the emergency need (which may include amounts necessary to pay any Federal,
state, local, or foreign income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to
result from the payment).  Payment shall be made within thirty days following
the determination by the Committee that a withdrawal shall be permitted under
this Section, or such later date as may be required under Section 7.11.  No
amounts attributable to the Cinergy Corp. Excess Profit Sharing Plan or the
Progress Energy, Inc. Key Manager Performance Share Sub-Plans may be
distributed pursuant to this Section.   

  7.9              In-Service Distribution -
Certain Pre-2005 Deferrals   .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Article VII, but only with respect to the portion of a Participant s Account
balance attributable to Pre-2005 Deferrals, other than amounts in the Legacy
Cinergy Subaccounts and the Legacy Progress Subaccounts, a distribution shall
be made to any Participant who, prior to Separation from Service, files a
written request for an immediate lump sum distribution in an amount not less
than $25,000 (the entire account balance in the case of Accounts that are
valued at less than $25,000), and who simultaneously agrees in writing to a
permanent forfeiture equal to 10% of the amount requested as a distribution. 
Such distribution, less the 10% forfeiture, shall be made within 30 days
following receipt by the Company of the signed request for distribution and
forfeiture agreement.  Distributions under this Section shall be removed from a
Participant s Accounts on a prorated basis.  

  7.10            Transition Relief for Payment
Elections   Post-2004 Deferrals   .  With respect to Post-2004 Deferrals,

Subaccount under the Plan; (b) change the form of payment of his or her
Subaccounts to a form of payment otherwise permitted for that Subaccount under
the Plan; or (c) receive payment of all or a designated portion of one or more

the Committee.  The Committee may also take any action that it deems necessary,
in its sole discretion, to amend prior Deferral Elections or payment elections
of a Participant, without the Participant s consent, to conform such elections
to the terms of this Plan.  This Section is intended to comply with Notice
2007-86, any subsequent notice or guidance, and the applicable proposed and
final Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code and shall be
interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.

respect to any Participant who is a Specified Employee as of his or her
Separation from Service, the payment of Post-2004 Deferrals that are otherwise
payable pursuant to the Participant s Separation from Service shall commence
within 60 days after the first business day of the seventh month following such
Separation from Service (or if earlier, upon the Participant s death).  

  7.12            Discretionary Acceleration of
Payment   .  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the time or
schedule of a payment of Post-2004 Deferrals under the Plan to a time or form
otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code in accordance with the
requirements, restrictions and limitations of Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-3(j) (   e.g.   , relating to domestic relations orders, employment
taxes, conflict of interests, income inclusion under Section 409A, state, local
or foreign taxes, offsets, bona fide disputes and small accounts); provided
that in no event may a payment be accelerated following a Specified Employee s
Separation from Service to a date that is prior to the first business day of
the seventh month following that Participant's Separation from Service (or if
earlier, upon the Participant's death) unless specifically permitted under
Section 409A of the Code (   e.g.   , relating to domestic relations orders,
employment taxes and conflict of interests). Except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Plan, the Committee may not accelerate the time or schedule of
any payment or amount scheduled to be paid under the Plan within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code.  

  7.13            Discretionary Delay of
Payments   .  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, delay the time or
form of payment of Post-2004 Deferrals under the Plan to a time or form
otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code in accordance with the
requirements, restrictions and limitations of Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-2(b)(7) (   e.g.   , relating to compliance with Section 162(m) of the
Code, federal securities laws or other applicable laws); provided that the
Committee treats all payments to similarly situated Participants on a
reasonably consistent basis.  

  7.14            Actual Date of Payment   . 
If calculation of the amount of the payment is not administratively practicable
due to events beyond the control of the Participant (or Beneficiary), the
payment will be treated as made upon the date specified under the Plan if the
payment is made during the first calendar year in which the calculation of the
amount of the payment is administratively practicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, payment must be made no later than the latest possible date
permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Moreover, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Plan to the contrary except Section 7.11, and to the extent permitted
by Section 409A of the Code, a payment will be treated as made upon the date
specified under the Plan if the payment is made as close as administratively
practicable to the relevant payment date specified herein, and in any event
within the same calendar year.  

   ARTICLE VIII 
BENEFICIARY   

  8.1              Designation of Beneficiary   . 
A Participant shall designate a Beneficiary to receive benefits under the Plan
by submitting to the Committee a Designation of Beneficiary in the form
required by the Committee.  If more than one Beneficiary is named, the share
and precedence of each Beneficiary shall be indicated.  A Participant shall
have the right to change the Beneficiary by submitting to the Committee a
Change of Beneficiary in the form provided, but no change of Beneficiary shall
be effective until acknowledged in writing by the Company.  If a deceased
Participant has failed to specify a surviving Beneficiary then the
Participant s estate shall be considered to be the Beneficiary  

  8.2              Designation by Beneficiary   . 
A Beneficiary who has become entitled to receive benefits shall designate a
Beneficiary.  

  8.3              Discharge of Obligations   . 
Any payment made by the Company, in good faith and in accordance with this
Plan, shall fully discharge the Company from all further obligations with
respect to that payment.  If the Company has any doubt as to the proper
Beneficiary to receive payments hereunder, the Company shall have the right to
withhold such payments until the matter is finally adjudicated.  

8.4              Payment
to Minors and Incapacitated Persons   .  In the event that any amount is
payable to a minor or to any person who, in the judgment of the Committee, is
incapable of making proper disposition thereof, such payment shall be made to
the legal guardian of the property of such minor or such person.  The Company
shall make such payments as directed by the Committee without the necessary
intervention of any guardian or like fiduciary, and without any obligation to
require bond or to see to the further application of such payment.  Any payment
so made shall be in complete discharge of the Plan s obligation to the
Participant and his or her Beneficiaries.  

   ARTICLE IX 
NATURE OF COMPANY S OBLIGATION   

  9.1              Unsecured Promise   .  The
Company s obligation to the Participant under this Plan shall be an unfunded
and unsecured promise to pay.  The rights of a Participant or Beneficiary under
this Plan shall be solely those of an unsecured general creditor of the
Company.  The Company shall not be obligated under any circumstances to set
aside or hold assets to fund its financial obligations under this Plan. 
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of a Change in
Control, the Company shall irrevocably set aside funds in an irrevocable  rabbi
trust  in an amount that is sufficient to pay each Participant the value of the
Participant s Legacy Progress Subaccounts, if any, as of the date on which the
Change in Control occurs; provided, however, that the trust shall not be funded
if the funding thereof would result in taxable income to the Participant by
reason of Section 409A(b) of the Code; and provided, further, in no event shall
any trust assets at any time be located or transferred outside of the United
States, within the meaning of Section 409A(b) of the Code.  

  9.2              No Right to Specific Assets   . 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion
establish such accounts, trusts, insurance policies or arrangements, or any
other mechanisms it deems necessary or appropriate to account for or fund its
obligations under the Plan.  Any assets which the Company may set aside,
acquire or hold to help cover its financial liabilities under this Plan are and
remain general assets of the Company subject to the claims of its creditors. 
The Company does not give, and the Plan does not give, any beneficial ownership
interest in any assets of the Company to a Participant or Beneficiary.  All
rights of ownership in any assets are and remain in the Company.  Any general
asset used or acquired by the Company in connection with the liabilities it has
assumed under this Plan shall not be deemed to be held under any trust for the
benefit of the Participant or any Beneficiary, and no general asset shall be
considered security for the performance of the obligations of the Company.  Any
asset shall remain a general, unpledged, and unrestricted asset of the Company.  

  9.3              Plan Provisions   .  The
Company s liability for payment of benefits shall be determined only under the
provisions of this Plan, as it may be amended from time to time.

SUPPLEMENTATION OF PLAN   

  10.1            Right to Terminate and Amend   . 
The Committee retains the sole and unilateral right to terminate, amend, modify
or supplement this Plan, in whole or in part, at any time.  The Committee may
delegate the right to amend the Plan, subject to any limitations it may impose,
to an officer of the Company.  No such action shall adversely affect a
Participant s right to receive amounts then credited to a Participant s Account
with respect to events occurring prior to the date of such amendment.  With
respect to Post-2004 Deferrals, subject to Section 7.11 hereof, the Committee
may, in its sole discretion to the extent permitted in Section 409A of the
Code, provide for the acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment under
the Plan upon the termination of the Plan.  With respect to Pre-2005 Deferrals
attributable to the Legacy Cinergy Plans, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, provide for the acceleration of the time or schedule of a payment
under the Plan provided such payments commence no later than the earlier of a
Participant s death or Separation from Service.  

  10.2            Change in Control   .  In
the event of a Change in Control, the Plan shall become irrevocable and may not
be amended or terminated without the written consent of each Plan Participant
who may be affected in any way by such amendment or termination, either at the
time of such action or at any time thereafter.  This restriction in the event
of a Change in Control shall be determined by reference to the date any
amendment or resolution terminating the Plan is actually signed by an
authorized party rather than the date such action purports to be effective.  

   ARTICLE XI 
RESTRICTIONS ON ALIENATION OF BENEFITS   

  11.1            No Assignment   .  Except as
permitted by the Plan, no right or benefit under the Plan shall be subject to
anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge.  Any
attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber or charge these
benefits shall be void.  No right or benefit under this Plan shall in any
manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, or torts
of the person entitled to the benefit.  If any Participant or Beneficiary under
the Plan should become bankrupt or attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell,
assign, pledge, encumber or charge any right to a benefit hereunder, then the
right or benefit, in the discretion of the Committee, shall cease.  In these
circumstances, the Committee may hold or apply the benefit payment or payments,
or any part of it, for the benefit of the Participant or his or her
Beneficiary, the Participant s spouse, children, or other dependents, or any of
them, in any manner and in any portion that the Committee may deem proper. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the
Code and subject to Section 7.12, the Committee shall honor a judgment, order
or decree from a state domestic relations court which requires the payment of
part or all of a Participant s or Beneficiary s interest under this Plan to an
 alternate payee  as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.  

ARTICLE XII

12.2            Plan
Administrator   .  The Committee is the administrator of the Plan within the
meaning of Section 3(16)(A) of ERISA.  As administrator, the Committee has the
authority (without limitation as to other authority) to delegate its duties to

appropriate to carry out the Plan.  The Committee has the discretion as a Plan
fiduciary (i) to interpret and construe the terms and provisions of the Plan
(including any rules or regulations adopted under the Plan), (ii) to determine
questions of eligibility to participate in the Plan and (iii) to make factual
determinations in connection with any of the foregoing.  A decision of the
Committee with respect to any matter pertaining to the Plan including without
limitation the Employees determined to be Participants, the benefits payable,
and the construction or interpretation of any provision thereof, shall be
conclusive and binding upon all interested persons.    

   ARTICLE XIII 
CLAIMS PROCEDURE   

  13.1            Claim   .  If a Participant
has any grievance, complaint, or claim concerning any aspect of the operation
or administration of the Plan, including but not limited to claims for benefits
and complaints concerning the performance or administration of the phantom
investment funds (collectively referred to herein as  claim  or  claims ), the
Participant shall submit the claim to the Committee, which shall have the
initial responsibility for deciding the claim.  

  13.2            Written Claim   .  A claim
for benefits shall be considered as having been made when submitted in writing
by the claimant to the Committee.  No particular form is required for the
claim, but the claim must identify the name of the claimant and describe
generally the benefit to which the claimant believes he or she is entitled. 
The claim may be delivered personally during normal business hours or mailed to
the Committee.  All such claims shall be submitted in writing and shall set
forth the relief requested and the reasons the relief should be granted.  All
such claims must be submitted with the  applicable limitations period.   The
 applicable limitations period  shall be two years beginning on:  (i) in the
case of any lump-sum payment, the date on which the payment was made, (ii) in
the case of an installment payment, the date of the first in the series of
payments, or (iii) for all other claims, the date on which the action
complained or grieved of occurred.  

  13.3            Committee Determination   . 
The Committee shall determine whether, or to what extent, the claim may be
allowed or denied under the terms of the Plan.  If the claim is wholly or
partially denied, the claimant shall be so informed by written notice within 90
days after the day the claim is submitted unless special circumstances require
an extension of time for processing the claim.  If such an extension of time
for processing is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished
to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period.  Such
extension may not exceed an additional 90 days from the end of the initial
90-day period.  The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances
requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render
the final decision.  If notice of denial of a claim (in whole or in part) is
not furnished within the initial 90-day period after the claim is submitted
(or, if applicable, the extended 90-day period), the claimant shall consider
that his or her claim has been denied just as if he or she had received actual
notice of denial.  

  13.4            Notice of Determination   . 
The notice informing the claimant that his or her claim has been wholly or
partially denied shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by
the claimant and shall include:  

  (a)           The specific reason(s) for the
denial.  

  (b)           Specific reference to pertinent
Plan provisions on which the denial is based.  

  (c)           A description of any additional
material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an
explanation of why such material or information is necessary.  

  (d)           Appropriate information as to
the steps to be taken if the Participant or Beneficiary wishes to submit his or
her claim for review.  

  13.5            Appeal   .  If the claim is
wholly or partially denied, the claimant (or his or her authorized
representative) may file an appeal of the denied claim with the Committee
requesting that the claim be reviewed.  The Committee shall conduct a full and
fair review of each appealed claim and its denial.  Unless the Committee
notifies the claimant that due to the nature of the benefit and other attendant
circumstances he or she is entitled to a greater period of time within which to
submit his or her request for review of a denied claim, the claimant shall have
60 days after he or she (or his or her authorized representative) receives
written notice of denial of his or her claim within which such request must be
submitted to the Committee.  

  13.6            Request for Review   .  The
request for review of a denied claim must be made in writing in connection with
making such request, the claimant or his or her authorized representative may:  

  (a)           Review pertinent documents.  

  (b)           Submit issues and comments in
writing.  

  13.7            Determination of Appeal   . 
The decision of the Committee regarding the appeal shall be promptly given to
the claimant in writing and shall normally be given no later than 60 days
following the receipt of the request for review.  However, if special
circumstances (for example, if the Committee decides to hold a hearing on the
appeal) require a further extension of time for processing, the decision shall
be rendered as soon as possible, but no later than 120 days after receipt of
the request for review.  However, if the Committee holds regularly scheduled
meetings at least quarterly, a decision on review shall be made by no later
than the date of the meeting which immediately follows the Plan s receipt of a
request for review, unless the request is filed within 30 days preceding the
date of such meeting.  In such case, a decision may be made by no later than
the date of the second meeting following the Plan s receipt of the request for
review.  If special circumstances (for example, if the Committee decides to
hold a hearing on the appeal) require a further extension of time for
processing, the decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but no later than
the third meeting following the Plan s receipt of the request for review.  If
special circumstances require that the decision shall be made beyond the
initial time for furnishing the decision, written notice of the extension shall
be furnished to the claimant (or his or her authorized representative) prior to
the commencement of the extension.  The decision on review shall be in writing
and shall be furnished to the claimant or to his or her authorized
representative within the appropriate time for the decision.  If a decision on
review is not furnished within the appropriate time, the claim shall be deemed
to have been denied on appeal.  

13.8            Hearing   . 
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, decide to hold a hearing if it
determines that a hearing is necessary or appropriate in order to make a full
and fair review of the appealed claim.   

  13.9            Decision   .  The decision
on review shall include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant, as well as specific references to
the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.  

  13.10          Exhaustion of Appeals   .  A
Participant must exhaust his or her rights to file a claim and to request a
review of the denial of his or her claim before bringing any civil action to
recover benefits due to him or her under the terms of the Plan, to enforce his
or her rights under the terms of the Plan, or to clarify his or her rights to
future benefits under the terms of the Plan.  No action at law or in equity to
recover under this Plan shall be commenced later than one year from the date of
the decision on review (or deemed denial if no decision is issued).  

  13.11          Committee s Authority   . 
The Committee shall exercise its responsibility and authority under this claims
procedure as a fiduciary and, in such capacity, shall have the discretionary
authority and responsibility (a) to interpret and construe the Plan and any
rules or regulations under the Plan, (b) to determine the eligibility of
Employees to participate in the Plan, and the rights of Participants to receive
benefits under the Plan, and (c) to make factual determinations in connection
with any of the foregoing.  

   ARTICLE XIV 
GENERAL PROVISIONS   

  14.1            No Right to Employment   . 
Nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to give any person the right to remain in
the employ of the Affiliated Group or its affiliates or affect the right of the
Affiliated group or its affiliates to terminate any Participant s employment
with or without cause.  

  14.2            Withholding   .  Any amount
required to be withheld under applicable Federal, state, local or other tax
laws (including any amounts required to be withheld under Section 3121(v) of
the Code) shall be withheld in such manner as the Committee shall determine and
any payment under the Plan shall be reduced by the amount so withheld, as well
as by any other lawful withholding.  

  14.3            Governing Law   .  This Plan
shall be construed and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of
North Carolina to the extent that such laws are not preempted by Federal law.  

  14.4            Transfer of Accounts   . 
The Account of each Spectra Energy Participant maintained under the Plan
immediately prior to the Distribution Date was transferred to the Spectra
Energy Corp Executive Savings Plan and assumed by Spectra Energy Corp as of the
Distribution Date (the  Assumed Amounts ). For purposes of this Plan, the term
 Assumed Amounts  shall include any amounts of Base Pay or Incentive Plan
awards of a Spectra Energy Participant that are earned but not yet paid as of
the Distribution Date or equity awards granted to a Spectra Energy Participant
under the Duke Energy Corporation 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, that were
properly deferred by the Spectra Energy Participant under the Plan but that had
not yet been credited to his or her Account under the Plan as of the
Distribution Date.  Each such Spectra Energy Participant shall have no further
rights under the Plan immediately after his or her Account is transferred to
the Spectra Energy Corp Executive Savings Plan and assumed by Spectra Energy
Corp in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employee Matters
Agreement by and between Duke Energy Corporation and Spectra Energy Corp (the
 Employee Matters Agreement ).  Capitalized terms used in this Section 14.5
that are not defined in this Plan shall have the meaning set forth in the
Employee Matters Agreement.  

  14.5            Compliance with Section 409A
of the Code   .  It is intended that the Plan comply with the provisions of
Section 409A of the Code, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any
amounts deferred hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the taxable year
or years in which such amounts would otherwise actually be paid or made
available to Participants or Beneficiaries. This Plan shall be construed,
administered, and governed in a manner that effects such intent, and the
Committee shall not take any action that would be inconsistent with such
intent.  Although the Committee shall use its best efforts to avoid the
imposition of taxation, interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code,
the tax treatment of deferrals under this Plan is not warranted or guaranteed. 
Neither the Company, the other members of the Affiliated Group, their
respective directors, officers, employees and advisors, the Board, nor the Committee
(nor its designee) shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or
other monetary amounts owed by any Participant, Beneficiary or other taxpayer
as a result of the Plan.  Any reference in this Plan to Section 409A of the
Code will also include any proposed, temporary or final regulations, or any
other guidance, promulgated with respect to such Section 409A of the Code by
the U.S. Department of Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service.  For purposes
of the Plan, the phrase  permitted by Section 409A of the Code,  or words or
phrases of similar import, shall mean that the event or circumstance shall only
be permitted to the extent it would not cause an amount deferred or payable
under the Plan to be includible in the gross income of a Participant or
Beneficiary under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.  

  14.6            Electronic or Other Media   . 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, including any
provision that requires the use of a written instrument, the Committee may
establish procedures for the use of electronic or other media in communications
and transactions between the Plan or the Committee and Participants and
Beneficiaries.  Electronic or other media may include, but are not limited to,
e-mail, the Internet, intranet systems and automated telephonic response
systems.  

  This amendment and restatement of the Plan
has been executed on behalf of the Company this ___ day of December, 2013.
