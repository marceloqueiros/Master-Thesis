    received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that
    (i) have equity-like characteristics that are the same as,
    or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the
    Preferred Stock, the Exchangeable Preferred Stock, the Capital
    Securities or Other Securities, as applicable, at the time of
    repayment, redemption or purchase, and (ii) the Company has
    obtained the prior approval of the

    Covenant to a holder of the relevant Covered Debt. For copies of

Exhibit 10.11(k) 

ELEVENTH AMENDMENT 
OF 
U.S. BANK NON-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLAN 

The U.S. Bank Non-Qualified Retirement Plan (the  Plan ) is amended as provided below.
This amendment is intended to clarify the Plan. The amendment below is not intended to make any
changes that would cause a violation of section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code or its
accompanying regulations. If a change in this amendment is determined to be a violation of section
409A, the amendment shall not be effective and shall be disregarded with respect to the rules
governing benefits under the Plan.

1. QUALIFIED PLAN. Effective January 1, 2010, Section 2.29 is amended to change
 Bancorp  to  Bank . 

2. ACCELERATED DISTRIBUTIONS. Effective January 1, 2005, Section 4.6
(formerly Section 4.5) of the Plan was amended to add the following introductory sentence:  The
provisions in Sections 4.5(a) and 4.5(b) below shall apply only with respect to Grandfathered
Amounts of Grandfathered Participants.  The references to Sections 4.5(a) and 4.5(b) are clarified
to read Sections 4.6(a) and 4.6(b). In addition, the Section references in Section 4.6 shall be
revised as appropriate. 

3. CHOICE OF VENUE AND RULES OF INTERPRETATION. Effective for claims filed on and after January 1,
2008, a new Section 13.9 was added ( Choice of Venue ) and the existing Section 13.9 ( Rules of
Interpretation ) was re-numbered as Section 13.10 with subsequent numbering and cross-references
revised as appropriate 

4. APPLICABLE LAWS. Effective January 1, 2009, a new Section 13.11 of the Plan
shall be added that reads as follows: 

13.11.  Applicable Laws .

13.11.1.  ERISA Status . The Plan is maintained with the understanding that the Plan is an
unfunded plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select
group of management or highly compensated employees as provided in sections 201(2), 301(3) and
401(a)(1) of ERISA, and section 2520.104-23 of the regulations under ERISA. Each provision shall be
interpreted and administered accordingly.

13.11.2.  Internal Revenue Code Status . The Plan is maintained as a nonqualified excess and
supplemental plan under section 409A of the Code. Each provision shall be interpreted and
administered in accordance with section 409A of the Code and guidance provided thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Employer nor any of its officers, directors, agents or
affiliates, nor the Committee shall be obligated, directly or indirectly, to any Participant or any
other person for any taxes, penalties, interest or like amounts that may be imposed on the
Participant or other person on account of any amounts under this Plan or on account of any failure
to comply with the Code.

5. APPENDICES B-10 and B-16. Effective December 31, 2009, the Formula  
Part A Benefit under Appendix B-10 of the Plan is frozen. In addition, effective December 31,
2009, the time and form of payment of the Formula   Part B Benefit under Appendix B-10 shall be
changed to be paid at the same time and form as the Participant s benefit under the Excess Benefit
(the benefits under Article IV of the Plan). Thus, the Formula   Part B Benefit under Appendix
B-10 shall be paid as of the later of attainment of age 62 or Separation from Service. The Formula
  Part A Benefit under Appendix B-10 is being frozen and the time and form of payment of the
Formula   Part B Benefit under Appendix B-10 is being changed to avoid the potential of the
shifting of benefits paid under Appendix B-10 and the benefits that could become payable under
Appendix B-16 if the substantial risk of forfeiture for Appendix B-16 lapses. 

6. APPENDIX B-15. Effective December 31, 2009, the Excess Benefit (the benefits under Article IV of
the Plan) of the Participant under Appendix B-15 shall be frozen. The Participant s Excess Benefit
is being frozen to avoid the potential of the shifting of benefits paid under Excess Benefit
portion of this Plan and the benefits the could become payable under Appendix B-15 if the
substantial risk of forfeiture for Appendix B-15 lapses. 

7. SAVINGS CLAUSE. Save and except as expressly amended above, the Plan shall continue in full
force and effect.

Management s
    Discussion and Analysis

For the fiscal year ended December
    31, 2009 

Overview  

The financial performance of U.S. Bancorp and its
    subsidiaries (the  Company ) in 2009 demonstrated the
    strength and quality of its businesses, as the Company achieved
    record total net revenue, maintained a strong capital position
    and grew both its balance sheet and fee-based businesses. While
    not immune to current economic conditions, the Company s
    well diversified business has provided substantial resiliency to
    the credit challenges faced by many financial institutions. The
    significant weakness in the domestic and global economy
    continued to affect the Company s loan portfolios, however
    the rate of deterioration moderated throughout 2009. Though
    business and consumer customers continue to be affected by the
    domestic recession and increased unemployment in the United
    States, the Company s comparative financial strength and
    enhanced product offerings attracted a significant amount of new
    customer relationships in 2009. Additionally, the Company
    continued to invest opportunistically in businesses and products
    that strengthen its presence and ability to serve customers,
    including Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
    ( FDIC ) assisted transactions.

Despite the economic environment adversely impacting the banking
    industry, the Company earned $2.2 billion in 2009. The
    difficult credit environment and related rise in credit costs
    resulted in a $2.5 billion (79.5 percent) increase in
    provision for credit losses over 2008. The increase in provision
    for credit losses was partially offset by higher net interest
    income, a result of growth in earning assets, core deposit
    growth and improving net interest margin, lower net securities
    losses, and strength in the Company s fee-based businesses,
    particularly mortgage banking. Additionally the Company
    continued its focus on effectively managing its cost structure,
    with an efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to
    taxable-equivalent net revenue, excluding net securities gains
    and losses) in 2009 of 48.4 percent, one of the lowest in
    the industry.

The Company maintained strong capital and liquidity during 2009.
    In May 2009, the Federal Reserve assessed the capital adequacy
    of the largest domestic banks, and concluded that the
    Company s capital would be sufficient under the Federal
    Reserve s projected scenarios. In June, the Company
    redeemed all of the $6.6 billion of preferred stock
    previously issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury
    under the Capital Purchase Program of the Emergency Economic
    Stabilization Act of 2008, or TARP program, and subsequently
    repurchased the related common stock warrant. The Company raised
    $2.7 billion through the sale of common stock in May, and
    at December 31, 2009, the Company s Tier 1
    capital ratio was 9.6 percent, its total risk-based capital
    ratio was 12.9 percent, and its tangible common equity to
    risk-weighted assets was 6.1 percent. Credit rating
    organizations rate the Company s debt one of the highest of
    its large domestic banking peers. This comparative financial
    strength generated growth in loans and deposits as a result of
     flight to quality,  as well as favorable funding
    costs and net interest margin expansion.

In 2009, the Company grew its loan portfolio and increased
    deposits significantly, both organically and through
    acquisition, including an FDIC assisted transaction in the
    fourth quarter. Average loans and deposits increased
    $20.3 billion (12.2 percent) and $31.6 billion
    (23.2 percent), respectively, over 2008. Excluding
    acquisitions, average loans and deposits increased
    $7.7 billion (4.7 percent) and $19.0 billion
    (14.2 percent), respectively, over 2008. The Company
    originated approximately $129 billion of loans and
    commitments for new and existing customers and had over
    $55 billion of new mortgage production during 2009. Despite
    this activity, the Company has experienced a decrease in average
    commercial loan balances as customers continued to pay down
    their credit lines and strengthen their own balance sheets.

The Company s increase in provision for credit losses
    reflected continuing weak economic conditions and the
    corresponding impact on commercial, commercial real estate and
    consumer loan portfolios, as well as stress in the residential
    real estate markets. As a result of these economic factors and
    an FDIC assisted acquisition, the Company s nonperforming
    assets as a percent of total loans and other real estate
    increased to 3.02 percent at December 31, 2009, from
    1.42 percent at December 31, 2008. In addition, net
    charge-offs as a percent of average loans outstanding increased
    to 2.08 percent in 2009 from 1.10 percent in 2008.
    These ratios increased throughout 2009, but at a decreasing rate
    in each linked quarter.

The Company s financial strength, business model, credit
    culture and focus on efficiency have enabled it to deliver
    consistently profitable financial performance while operating in
    a very turbulent environment. Given the current economic
    environment, the Company will continue to focus on managing
    credit losses and operating costs, while also utilizing its
    financial strength to grow market share and profitability.
    Despite the likelihood of significant changes in regulation of
    the industry, the Company believes it is well positioned for
    long-term growth in earnings per common share and an
    industry-leading return on common equity. The

Company intends to achieve these financial objectives by
    providing high-quality customer service, continuing to carefully
    manage costs and, where appropriate, strategically investing in
    businesses that diversify and generate fee-based revenues,
    enhance the Company s distribution network or expand its
    product offerings.

Earnings
    Summary     The Company
    reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of
    $2.2 billion in 2009, or $.97 per diluted common share,
    compared with $2.9 billion, or $1.61 per diluted common
    share, in 2008. Return on average assets and return on average
    common equity were .82 percent and 8.2 percent,
    respectively, in 2009, compared with 1.21 percent and
    13.9 percent, respectively, in 2008. The results for 2009
    reflected higher provision for credit losses, as the Company
    experienced a $2.1 billion increase in net
     charge-offs 
    and increased its allowance for credit losses by
    $1.7 billion due to economic conditions and credit
    deterioration. Net securities losses of $451 million in
    2009 were $527 million (53.9 percent) lower than 2008.

Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis, for 2009 was
    $2.0 billion (13.6 percent) higher than 2008,
    reflecting a 10.8 percent increase in net interest income
    and a 16.8 percent increase in noninterest income. Net
    interest income increased in 2009 as a result of growth in
    average earning assets, core deposit growth and improving net
    interest margin. Noninterest income increased principally due to
    strong growth in mortgage banking revenue, a decrease in net
    securities losses and higher commercial products revenue, ATM
    processing services and treasury management fees.

Total noninterest expense in 2009 increased $933 million
    (12.7 percent), compared with 2008, primarily due to the
    impact of acquisitions, higher FDIC deposit insurance expense,
    costs related to affordable housing and other tax-advantaged
    investments, and marketing and business development expense,
    principally related to credit card initiatives.

Acquisitions
        On October 30,
    2009, the Company acquired the banking operations of First Bank
    of Oak Park Corporation ( FBOP ) in an FDIC assisted
    transaction. The Company acquired approximately
    $18.0 billion of assets and assumed approximately
    $17.4 billion of liabilities, including $15.4 billion
    of deposits. The Company entered into loss sharing agreements
    with the FDIC providing for specified credit loss protection for
    substantially all acquired loans, foreclosed real estate and
    selected investment securities. Under the terms of the loss
    sharing agreements, the FDIC will reimburse the Company for
    80 percent of the first $3.5 billion of losses on
    those assets and 95 percent of losses beyond that amount.
    At the acquisition date, the Company estimated the FBOP assets
    would incur approximately $2.8 billion of losses, of which
    $1.9 billion would be reimbursable under the loss sharing
    agreements as losses are realized in future periods. The Company
    recorded the acquired assets and liabilities at their estimated
    fair values at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value
    for loans reflected expected credit losses at the acquisition
    date and related reimbursement under the loss sharing
    agreements. As a result, the Company will only recognize a
    provision for credit losses and charge-offs on the acquired
    loans for any further credit deterioration, net of any expected
    reimbursement under the loss sharing agreements.

On November 21, 2008, the Company acquired the banking
    operations of Downey Savings   Loan Association, F.A.
    ( Downey ), and PFF Bank   Trust
    ( PFF ) from the FDIC. The Company acquired
    approximately $17.4 billion of assets and assumed
    approximately $15.8 billion of liabilities. The Company
    entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC providing for
    specified credit loss and asset yield protection for all single
    family residential mortgages and credit loss protection for a
    significant portion of commercial and commercial real estate
    loans and foreclosed real estate. Under the terms of the loss
    sharing agreements, the Company will incur the first
    $1.6 billion of losses on those assets. The FDIC will
    reimburse the Company for 80 percent of the next
    $3.1 billion of losses and 95 percent of losses beyond
    that amount. At the acquisition date, the Company estimated the
    Downey and PFF assets would incur approximately
    $4.7 billion of losses, of which $2.4 billion would be
    reimbursable under the loss sharing agreements. At the
    acquisition date, the Company identified the acquired
    non-revolving loans experiencing credit deterioration,
    representing the majority of assets acquired, and recorded those
    assets at their estimated fair value, reflecting expected credit
    losses and the related reimbursement under the loss sharing
    agreements. As a result, the Company only records provision for
    credit losses and charge-offs on these loans for any further
    credit deterioration after the date of acquisition. Based on the
    accounting guidance applicable in 2008, the Company recorded all
    other loans at the predecessors  carrying amount, net of
    fair value adjustments for any interest rate related discount or
    premium, and an allowance for credit losses.

At December 31, 2009, $22.5 billion of the
    Company s assets were covered by loss sharing agreements
    with the FDIC ( covered assets ), compared with
    $11.5 billion at

Statement of
    Income Analysis  

Net Interest
    Income     Net interest
    income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was $8.7 billion in
    2009, compared with $7.9 billion in 2008 and
    $6.8 billion in 2007. The $.8 billion
    (10.8 percent) increase in net interest income in 2009,
    compared with 2008, was attributable to growth in average
    earning assets and lower cost core deposit funding. Average
    earning assets were $237.3 billion for 2009, compared with
    $215.1 billion and $194.7 billion for 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The $22.2 billion (10.3 percent)
    increase in average earning assets in 2009 over 2008 was
    principally a result of growth in total average loans, including
    originated and acquired loans, and loans
     held-for-sale. 
    The net interest margin in 2009 was 3.67 percent, compared
    with 3.66 percent in 2008 and 3.47 percent in 2007.
    The net interest margin in 2008 benefited late in the year from
    significant turbulence in market rates as a result of financial
    market disruption. The net interest margin decreased in early
    2009 as market rates returned to more historically normal
    levels. However, as a result of the Company s ability to
    attract low cost deposits, net interest margin increased
    throughout the remainder of the year, resulting in a net
    interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2009 of
    3.83 percent. Given the current interest rate environment,
    the Company expects the net interest margin will remain
    relatively stable with a positive bias. Refer to the
     Interest Rate Risk Management  section for further
    information on the sensitivity of the Company s net
    interest income to changes in interest rates.

Average total loans were $185.8 billion in 2009, compared
    with $165.6 billion in 2008. Average loans increased
    $20.3 billion (12.2 percent) in 2009, driven by new
    loan originations, acquisitions and portfolio purchases. Average
    retail loans increased $6.5 billion (11.6 percent)
     year-over-year, 
    driven by increases in credit card, home equity and student
    loans. Average credit card balances were $3.0 billion
    (25.0 percent) higher, reflecting both growth in existing
    portfolios and portfolio purchases of approximately
    $1.6 billion during 2009. Average home equity and student
    loans, included in retail loans, increased 10.2 percent and
    57.4 percent, respectively. Average commercial real estate
    balances increased $2.6 billion (8.5 percent), and
    reflected new business and higher utilization of existing credit
    facilities, driven by market conditions. Residential mortgages
    increased $1.2 billion (5.3 percent), reflecting an
    increase in activity as a result of market interest rate
    declines, including an increase in government agency-guaranteed
    mortgages. Average commercial loans decreased $1.5 billion

This
    table shows the components of the change in net interest income
    by volume and rate on a taxable-equivalent basis utilizing a tax
    rate of 35 percent. This table does not take into account
    the level of noninterest-bearing funding, nor does it fully
    reflect changes in the mix of assets and liabilities. The change
    in interest not solely due to changes in volume or rates has
    been allocated on a pro-rata basis to volume and
    yield/rate.   

(2.7 percent)
     year-over-year 
    principally due to lower utilization of existing commitments and
    a reduction in the demand for new loans. Average covered assets
    increased $11.4 billion, due to the timing of the Downey,
    PFF and FBOP acquisitions.

Average investment securities in 2009 were essentially unchanged
    from 2008, as security purchases offset maturities and sales. In
    2009, the composition of the Company s investment portfolio
    shifted to a larger proportion in U.S. Treasury, agency and
    agency mortgage-backed securities, compared with a year ago.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits in 2009 were
    $9.1 billion (31.7 percent) higher than 2008. The
    increase reflected higher business demand deposit balances,
    partially offset by lower trust demand deposits.

Average total savings products increased $18.4 billion
    (29.0 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008, principally as
    a result of a $7.2 billion increase in savings accounts due
    to strong participation in a new savings product introduced
    across the franchise by Consumer Banking late in the third
    quarter of 2008, a $5.7 billion (18.4 percent)
    increase in interest checking balances from higher government
    and consumer banking customer balances and acquisitions, and a
    $5.5 billion (20.9 percent) increase in money market
    savings balances from higher broker-dealer, corporate trust and
    institutional trust customer balances and acquisitions.

Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000
    increased $4.3 billion (31.6 percent) primarily due to
    acquisitions. Average time deposits greater than $100,000
    decreased $.2 billion (.7 percent) in 2009, compared
    with 2008. Time deposits greater than $100,000 are managed as an
    alternative to other funding sources, such as wholesale
    borrowing, based largely on relative pricing.

The $1.1 billion (16.3 percent) increase in net
    interest income in 2008, compared with 2007, was attributable to
    strong growth in average earning assets, as well as an

22     U.S. BANCORP

improved net interest margin. The $20.3 billion
    (10.5 percent) increase in average earning assets in 2008
    over 2007 was principally a result of growth in total average
    loans, including originated and acquired loans, and average
    investment securities. The increase in the net interest margin
    reflected growth in higher-spread loans, asset/liability
    re-pricing in a declining interest rate environment and
    wholesale funding mix during a period of significant volatility
    in short-term funding markets.

Average loans in 2008 were higher by $18.2 billion
    (12.4 percent), compared with 2007, driven by growth in
    most loan categories. Average investment securities were
    $1.5 billion (3.7 percent) higher in 2008, compared
    with 2007, principally reflecting the full year impact of
    holding structured investment securities the Company purchased
    in the fourth quarter of 2007 from certain money market funds
    managed by an affiliate and higher government agency securities,
    partially offset by maturities and sales of mortgage-backed
    securities, and realized and unrealized losses on certain
    investment securities recorded in 2008.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits in 2008 were
    $1.4 billion (5.0 percent) higher than 2007. The
    increase reflected higher business and other demand deposit
    balances, impacted by customer flight to quality and
    acquisitions. Average total savings products increased
    $6.6 billion (11.6 percent) in 2008, compared with
    2007, principally as a result of a $5.0 billion
    (19.2 percent) increase in interest checking balances from
    broker-dealer, institutional trust, government and consumer
    banking customers, and a $1.0 billion (3.8 percent)
    increase in money market savings balances driven primarily by
    higher broker-dealer and consumer banking balances. Average time
    certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were lower in 2008 by
    $1.1 billion (7.3 percent), compared with 2007, due to
    the Company s funding and pricing decisions and competition
    for these deposits. Average time deposits greater than $100,000
    increased by $8.2 billion (36.7 percent) in 2008,
    compared with 2007, as a result of the Company s wholesale
    funding decisions and the ability to attract larger customer
    deposits as a result of the Company s relative strength.

Provision for
    Credit Losses     The
    provision for credit losses reflects changes in the credit
    quality of the entire portfolio of loans, inclusive of credit
    loss protection from loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, and
    is maintained at a level considered appropriate by management
    for probable and estimable incurred losses, based on factors
    discussed in the  Analysis and Determination of Allowance
    for Credit Losses  section.

In 2009, the provision for credit losses was $5.6 billion,
    compared with $3.1 billion and $792 million in 2008
    and 2007, respectively. The increases in the provision for
    credit losses of $2.5 billion from a year ago and allowance
    for credit losses from December 31, 2008 reflected
    deterioration in economic conditions during most of the year and
    the corresponding impact on the commercial, commercial real
    estate and consumer loan portfolios. It also reflected
    continuing stress in the residential real estate markets.
    Nonperforming assets increased $1.9 billion (excluding
    covered assets) over December 31, 2008. The increase was
    driven primarily by stress in residential home construction and
    related industries, deterioration in the residential mortgage
    portfolio, as well as an increase in foreclosed properties and
    the impact of the economic slowdown on commercial and consumer
    customers. Net charge-offs increased $2.1 billion from
    2008, primarily due to economic factors affecting the
    residential housing markets, including homebuilding and related
    industries, commercial real estate properties and credit costs
    associated with credit card and other consumer and commercial
    loans as the economy weakened and unemployment increased.

Accruing loans ninety days or more past due increased
    $558 million (excluding covered assets), primarily due to
    stress in residential mortgages, commercial loans, construction
    loans, credit cards and home equity loans. Restructured loans
    that continue to accrue interest increased $769 million,
    primarily reflecting the impact of loan modifications for
    certain residential mortgage and consumer credit card customers
    in light of current economic conditions.

The $2.3 billion increase in the provision for credit
    losses in 2008, compared with 2007, and the increase in the
    allowance for credit losses from December 31, 2007 to
    December 31, 2008 reflected stress in the residential real
    estate markets, including homebuilding and related supplier
    industries, driven by declining home prices in most geographic
    regions. The increases also reflected deteriorating economic
    conditions and the corresponding impact on the commercial and
    consumer loan portfolios. Nonperforming loans increased
    $1.2 billion (excluding covered assets) over
    December 31, 2007. The increase was driven primarily by
    weakening real estate values and the impact of the economic
    slowdown on other commercial customers, and included increases
    in commercial real estate loans, commercial loans and
    residential mortgages. Net charge-offs increased
    $1.0 billion in 2008, compared with 2007, primarily due to
    the factors affecting the residential housing markets, including
    the impact on homebuilding and related industries,

Refer to  Corporate Risk Profile  for further
    information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs,
    nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company
    in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and
    establishing the allowance for credit losses.

Noninterest
    Income     Noninterest
    income in 2009 was $8.0 billion, compared with
    $6.8 billion in 2008 and $7.3 billion in 2007. The
    $1.2 billion (16.8 percent) increase in 2009 over
    2008, was principally due to a $765 million increase in
    mortgage banking revenue, the result of strong mortgage loan
    production in the current low interest rate environment and an
    increase in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights
    ( MSRs ) net of related economic hedging instruments.
    Other increases in noninterest income included higher ATM
    processing services of 12.0 percent related to growth in
    transaction volumes and business expansion, higher treasury
    management fees of 6.8 percent resulting from increased new
    business activity and pricing, and 25.0 percent higher
    commercial products revenue due to higher letters of credit,
    capital markets and other commercial loan fees. Net securities
    losses in 2009 were 53.9 percent lower than the prior year.
    Other income decreased 9.3 percent, due to
    $551 million in gains in 2008 related to the Company s
    ownership position in Visa Inc., partially offset by a reduction
    in residual lease valuation losses in the current year, a
    $92 million gain from a corporate real estate transaction
    in 2009, and other payments-related gains in 2009. Deposit
    service charges decreased 10.3 percent primarily due to a
    decrease in the number of transaction-related fees, which more
    than offset account growth. Trust and investment management fees
    declined 11.1 percent, reflecting lower assets under
    management account volume and the impact of low interest rates
    on money market investment fees. Investment product fees and
    commissions declined 25.9 percent due to lower sales levels
    from a year ago.

The $485 million (6.6 percent) decrease in 2008 in
    noninterest income from 2007, was driven by higher impairment
    charges on investment securities and higher retail lease
    residual losses, partially offset by the 2008 gains related to
    the Company s ownership position in Visa Inc. and growth in
    fee income. In addition, noninterest income for 2008 was reduced
    by the adoption of accounting guidance related to fair value
    measurements in the financial statements. Upon adoption of this
    guidance, trading revenue decreased $62 million, as a
    result of the consideration of nonperformance risk for certain
    customer-related financial instruments. The growth in credit and
    debit card revenue in 2008 over 2007 was primarily driven by an
    increase in customer accounts and higher customer transaction
    volumes. The corporate payment products revenue growth reflected
    growth in sales volumes and business expansion. ATM processing
    services revenue increased due primarily to growth in
    transaction volumes, including the impact of additional ATMs
    during 2008. Merchant processing services revenue was higher in
    2008 than 2007, reflecting higher transaction volume and
    business expansion. Treasury management fees increased due
    primarily to the favorable impact of declining rates on customer
    compensating balances. Commercial products revenue increased due
    to higher foreign exchange revenue, syndication fees, letters of
    credit fees, fees on customer derivatives, and other commercial
    loan fees. Mortgage banking revenue increased

    income and production revenue, partially offset by a decrease in
    the valuation of MSRs net of related economic hedging
    instruments. Other income was higher due to the 2008 gains
    related to the Company s ownership position in Visa Inc.,
    partially offset by higher retail lease valuation losses, lower
    equity investment revenue, market valuation losses and the
    $62 million unfavorable impact to trading income from the
    adoption of new accounting guidance.

Noninterest
    Expense     Noninterest
    expense in 2009 was $8.3 billion, compared with
    $7.3 billion in 2008 and $6.9 billion in 2007. The
    Company s efficiency ratio was 48.4 percent in 2009,
    compared with 46.9 percent in 2008. The $933 million
    (12.7 percent) increase in noninterest expense in 2009,
    compared with 2008, was principally due to the impact of
    acquisitions, higher ongoing FDIC deposit insurance expense, and
    a $123 million special assessment, costs related to
    affordable housing and other tax-advantaged investments, and
    marketing and business development expense. Compensation expense
    increased 3.2 percent primarily due to acquisitions,
    partially offset by reductions from cost containment efforts.
    Employee benefits expense increased 11.5 percent primarily
    due to increased pension costs associated with previous declines
    in the value of pension assets. Net occupancy and equipment
    expense, and professional services expense increased
    7.0 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively, primarily
    due to acquisitions, as well as branch-based and other business
    expansion initiatives. Marketing and business development
    expense increased 21.9 percent principally due to costs
    related to the introduction of new credit card products and
    advertising the Company s national branding strategy, while
    technology and business communications expense increased
    12.5 percent primarily related to business expansion
    initiatives. Other intangibles expense increased
    9.0 percent due to acquisitions. Other expense increased
    44.3 percent due to higher FDIC deposit insurance expense,
    including a $123 million special assessment in the second
    quarter of 2009. Other expense also reflected increased costs
    related to investments in affordable housing and other
    tax-advantaged projects, higher merchant processing expenses,
    growth in mortgage servicing expenses and costs associated with
    other real estate owned.

The $441 million (6.4 percent) increase in noninterest
    expense in 2008, compared with 2007, was principally due to
    investments in business initiatives, including acquisitions,
    higher credit collection costs, and incremental expenses
    associated with investments in tax-advantaged projects,
    partially offset by $330 million of charges recognized in
    2007 for the Company s proportionate share of a contingent
    obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. for certain litigation matters
    ( 2007 Visa Charge ). Compensation expense was higher
    in 2008 than 2007 due to growth in ongoing bank operations,
    acquired businesses and other bank initiatives to increase the
    Company s banking presence and enhance customer
    relationship management. Employee benefits expense increased as
    higher payroll taxes and medical costs were partially offset by
    lower pension costs. Net occupancy and equipment expense
    increased primarily due to acquisitions and branch-based and
    other business expansion initiatives. Marketing and business
    development expense increased due to costs incurred in 2008 for
    a national advertising campaign, as well as a $25 million
    charitable contribution made to the Company s foundation in
    2008. Technology and communications expense increased due to
    higher processing volumes and business expansion. Other
    intangibles expense decreased reflecting the timing and

U.S. BANCORP   25 

relative size of acquisitions. Other expense decreased,
    primarily due to the 2007 Visa Charge, partially offset by
    increases in 2008 in credit-related costs for other real estate
    owned and loan collection activities and investments in
    tax-advantaged projects.

Pension Plans
        Because of the
    long-term nature of pension plans, the related accounting is
    complex and can be impacted by several factors, including
    investment funding policies, accounting methods, and actuarial
    assumptions.

The Company s pension accounting reflects the long-term
    nature of the benefit obligations and the investment horizon of
    plan assets. Amounts recorded in the financial statements
    reflect actuarial assumptions about participant benefits and
    plan asset returns. Changes in actuarial assumptions, and
    differences in actual plan experience compared with actuarial
    assumptions, are deferred and recognized in expense in future
    periods. Differences related to participant benefits are
    recognized over the future service period of the employees.
    Differences related to the expected return on plan assets are
    included in expense over a twelve-year period.

The Company expects pension expense to increase $25 million
    in 2010, driven by a $27 million increase related to asset
    return differences, an $8 million increase related to other
    actuarial gains and losses, and a $10 million decrease
    related to the January 1, 2010 establishment of a cash
    balance pension plan for certain current and all future eligible
    employees. If performance of plan assets equals the
    actuarially-assumed long-term rate of return
    ( LTROR ), the cumulative difference of
    $613 million at December 31, 2009 will incrementally
    increase pension expense $35 million in 2011,
    $38 million in 2012 and $49 million in 2013, and
    decrease pension expense $12 million in 2014. Because of
    the complexity of forecasting pension plan activities, the
    accounting methods utilized for pension plans, the
    Company s ability to respond to factors affecting the plans
    and the hypothetical nature of actuarial assumptions, actual
    pension expense will differ from these amounts.

Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further information on the Company s pension
    plan funding practices, investment policies and asset allocation
    strategies, and accounting policies for pension plans.

The following table shows an analysis of hypothetical changes in
    the LTROR and discount rate:

Income Tax
    Expense     The
    provision for income taxes was $395 million (an effective
    rate of 15.0 percent) in 2009, compared with
    $1.1 billion (an effective rate of 26.5 percent) in
    2008 and $1.9 billion (an effective rate of
    30.0 percent) in 2007. The decrease in the effective tax
    rate from 2008 reflected the impact of the relative level of
    tax-exempt income and investments in affordable housing and
    other tax-advantaged projects, combined with lower pre-tax
    earnings
     year-over-year. 

For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 19
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Balance Sheet
    Analysis  

Average earning assets were $237.3 billion in 2009,
    compared with $215.0 billion in 2008. The increase in
    average earning assets of $22.2 billion (10.3 percent)
    was due to growth in total average loans of $20.3 billion
    (12.2 percent) and loans
     held-for-sale 
    of $1.9 billion (48.7 percent).

For average balance information, refer to Consolidated Daily
    Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates on
    pages 126 and 127.

Loans
        The Company s
    loan portfolio was $195.4 billion at December 31,
    2009, an increase of $10.2 billion (5.5 percent) from
    December 31, 2008. The increase was driven by growth in
    retail loans of $3.6 billion (5.9 percent),
    residential mortgages of $2.5 billion (10.5 percent),
    commercial real estate loans of $.9 billion
    (2.6 percent) and covered assets of $11.1 billion,
    partially offset by a decrease in commercial loans of
    $7.8 billion (13.8 percent). Table 6 provides a
    summary of the loan distribution by product type, while Table 10
    provides a summary of selected loan maturity distribution by
    loan category. Average total loans increased $20.3 billion
    (12.2 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008. The increase
    was due to growth in most major loan categories in 2009.

Commercial
        Commercial loans,
    including lease financing, decreased $7.8 billion
    (13.8 percent) as of December 31,

26     U.S. BANCORP

Table
    6        Loan
    Portfolio Distribution 

2009, compared with December 31, 2008. The decrease in
    commercial loans was primarily driven by lower capital spending
    and economic conditions impacting loan demand by business
    customers, along with the access to bond markets by those
    customers to refinance their bank debt. Average commercial loans
    decreased $1.5 billion (2.7 percent) in 2009, compared
    with 2008, primarily due to lower utilization of existing
    commitments and a reduction in demand for new loans.
    Table 7 provides a summary of commercial loans by industry
    and geographical locations.

Commercial
    Real Estate     The
    Company s portfolio of commercial real estate loans, which
    includes commercial mortgages and construction loans, increased
    $.9 billion (2.6 percent) at December 31, 2009,
    compared with December 31, 2008. Average commercial real
    estate loans increased $2.6 billion (8.5 percent) in
    2009, compared with 2008. The growth in commercial real estate
    loans reflected new business growth and the extension of
    existing credit facilities, as current market conditions have
    limited borrower access to real estate capital markets. Table 8
    provides a summary of commercial real estate by property type
    and geographic location. The collateral for $4.7 billion of
    commercial real estate loans included in covered assets at
    December 31, 2009 was in California, compared with
    $.8 billion at December 31, 2008.

The Company classifies loans as construction until the
    completion of the construction phase. Following construction, if
    a loan is retained, the loan is reclassified to the commercial
    mortgage category. In 2009, approximately $947 million of
    construction loans were reclassified to the commercial mortgage
    loan category for permanent financing after completion of the
    construction phase. At December 31, 2009, $214 million
    of tax-exempt industrial development loans were secured by real
    estate. The Company s commercial real estate mortgages and
    construction loans had unfunded commitments of $6.1 billion
    and $8.0 billion at

U.S. BANCORP   27 

Table
    7        Commercial
    Loans by Industry Group and Geography, Excluding Covered
    Assets 

December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company also
    finances the operations of real estate developers and other
    entities with operations related to real estate. These loans are
    not secured directly by real estate and are subject to terms and
    conditions similar to commercial loans. These loans were
    included in the commercial loan category and totaled
    $1.8 billion at December 31, 2009.

Residential
    Mortgages
        Residential
    mortgages held in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2009,
    increased $2.5 billion (10.5 percent) from
    December 31, 2008. Average residential mortgages increased
    $1.2 billion (5.3 percent) in 2009, compared with
    2008. The growth principally reflected an increase in production
    as a result of market interest rate declines, including an
    increase in government agency-guaranteed mortgages. Most loans
    retained in the portfolio are to customers with prime or
    near-prime credit characteristics at the date of origination.

Retail
        Total retail loans
    outstanding, which include credit card, retail leasing, home
    equity and second mortgages and other retail loans, increased
    $3.6 billion (5.9 percent) at December 31, 2009,
    compared with December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily
    driven by growth in credit card balances and home equity and
    second mortgages, partially offset by lower retail leasing
    balances. Average retail loans increased $6.5 billion
    (11.6 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008, as a result of
    current year growth and a student loan portfolio purchase in
    2008.

    approximately 78.2 percent were to customers located in the
    Company s primary banking region. Table 9 provides a
    geographic summary of residential mortgages and retail loans
    outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. The
    collateral for $6.6 billion of residential mortgages and
    retail loans included in covered assets at December 31,
    2009 was in California, compared with $7.1 billion at
    December 31, 2008.

Loans Held for
    Sale     Loans held for
    sale, consisting primarily of residential mortgages and student
    loans to be sold in the secondary market, were $4.8 billion
    at December 31, 2009, compared with $3.2 billion at
    December 31, 2008. The increase in loans held for sale was
    principally due to an increase in mortgage loan origination
    activity as a result of a decline in market interest rates.

Investment
    Securities     The
    Company uses its investment securities portfolio for several
    purposes. It serves as a vehicle to manage enterprise interest
    rate risk, generates interest and dividend income from the
    investment of excess funds depending on loan demand, provides
    liquidity and is used as collateral for public deposits and
    wholesale funding sources. While the Company intends to hold its
    investment securities indefinitely, it may sell securities in
    response to structural changes in the balance sheet and related
    interest rate risk and to meet liquidity requirements, among
    other factors.

At December 31, 2009, investment securities totaled
    $44.8 billion, compared with $39.5 billion at
    December 31, 2008. The $5.3 billion
    (13.3 percent) increase reflected $3.1 billion of net
    investment purchases and a $2.2 billion decrease in net
    unrealized losses. At December 31, 2009, adjustable-rate
    financial instruments comprised 46 percent of the
    investment securities portfolio, compared with 40 percent
    at December 31, 2008.

Average investment securities were $42.8 billion in 2009,
    essentially unchanged from 2008. The weighted-average yield of
    the
     available-for-sale 
    portfolio was 4.00 percent at December 31, 2009,
    compared with 4.56 percent at December 31, 2008. The
    average maturity of the
     available-for-sale 
    portfolio decreased to 7.1 years at December 31, 2009,
    from 7.7 years at December 31, 2008. Investment
    securities by type are shown in Table 11.

The Company conducts a regular assessment of its investment
    portfolios to determine whether any securities are
     other-than-temporarily 
    impaired. During 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued new accounting guidance, which the Company adopted
    effective January 1, 2009, for the measurement and
    recognition of
     other-than-temporary 
    impairment for debt securities. This guidance requires the
    portion of
     other-than-temporary 
    impairment related to factors other than anticipated credit
    losses be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss),
    rather than earnings.

At December 31, 2009, the Company s net unrealized
    loss on
     available-for-sale 
    securities was $.6 billion, compared with a net unrealized
    loss of $2.8 billion at December 31, 2008. The
    decrease in unrealized losses was primarily due to increases in
    the fair value of agency mortgage-backed securities and
    obligations of state and political subdivisions, and to amounts
    recognized as
     other-than-temporary 
    impairments in earnings. When assessing impairment, the Company
    considers the nature of the investment, the financial condition
    of the issuer, the extent and duration of unrealized loss,
    expected cash flows of underlying collateral or assets and
    market conditions. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no
    plans to sell securities with unrealized losses and believes it
    is more likely than not it would not be required to sell such
    securities before recovery of their amortized cost.

During 2009, the Company recognized impairment charges in
    earnings related to perpetual preferred securities, primarily
    issued by financial institutions, of $223 million. The net
    unrealized loss for the Company s remaining investments in
    perpetual preferred securities was $60 million at
    December 31, 2009.

There is limited market activity for the structured investment
    and non-agency mortgage-backed securities held by the Company.
    As a result, the Company estimates the fair value of these
    securities using estimates of expected cash flows, discount
    rates and management s assessment of various market
    factors, which are judgmental in nature. The Company recorded
    $363 million of impairment charges in earnings on
    non-agency mortgage-backed and structured investment related
    securities during 2009. These impairment charges were due to
    changes in expected cash flows resulting from the continuing
    decline in housing prices and an increase in foreclosure
    activity. Further adverse changes in market conditions may
    result in additional impairment charges in future periods.

In 2008, the Company recorded $788 million of impairment
    charges on structured investment and related securities, and
    $232 million of impairment charges on other investment
    securities, including government-sponsored enterprises,
    preferred stock and
     non-agency 
    mortgage-backed securities.

Deposits
        Total deposits were

    $159.4 billion at December 31, 2008. The
    $23.9 billion (15.0 percent) increase in total
    deposits reflected organic growth in core deposits and
    $15.4 billion of deposits assumed in the FBOP acquisition.

The maturity of time deposits was as follows:

U.S. BANCORP   33 

deposits increased $31.6 billion (23.2 percent) over
    2008, reflecting an increase in all major deposit categories.

Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2009,
    increased $.7 billion (1.8 percent) from
    December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable
    to higher business demand balances as well as the FBOP
    acquisition. The increase was partially offset by lower
    broker-dealer balances. Average noninterest-bearing deposits
    increased $9.1 billion (31.7 percent) in 2009,
    compared with 2008, due primarily to higher business demand
    deposits, partially offset by lower trust demand deposits.

Interest-bearing savings deposits increased $28.7 billion
    (42.6 percent) at December 31, 2009, compared with
    December 31, 2008. The increase in these deposit balances
    was primarily related to higher savings, interest checking and
    money market savings balances. The $7.8 billion
    (86.2 percent) increase in savings account balances
    reflected strong participation in a new savings product
    introduced in late 2008 by Consumer Banking, higher
    broker-dealer balances, and the impact of the FBOP acquisition.
    The $6.2 billion (19.2 percent) increase in interest
    checking account balances was due to higher branch-based and
    broker-dealer balances, as well as the impact of the FBOP
    acquisition. The $14.7 billion (56.3 percent) increase
    in money market savings account balances reflected higher
    corporate trust, institutional trust and custody, and
    broker-dealer balances, as well as the impact of the FBOP
    acquisition. Average interest-bearing savings deposits in 2009
    increased $18.4 billion (29.0 percent), compared with
    2008, primarily driven by higher savings account balances of
    $7.2 billion, interest checking account balances of
    $5.7 billion (18.4 percent) and money market savings
    account balances of $5.5 billion (20.9 percent).

Interest-bearing time deposits at December 31, 2009,
    decreased $5.5 billion (10.1 percent), compared with
    December 31, 2008, driven primarily by a decrease in time
    deposits greater than $100,000, as a result of the
    Company s funding and pricing decisions. Time certificates
    of deposit less than $100,000 increased $541 million
    (2.9 percent) at December 31, 2009, compared with
    December 31, 2008. Average time certificates of deposit
    less than $100,000 in 2009 increased $4.3 billion
    (31.6 percent), compared with 2008, due primarily to
    acquisitions. Time deposits greater than $100,000 decreased
    $6.0 billion (16.8 percent) at December 31, 2009,
    compared with December 31, 2008. Average time deposits
    greater than $100,000 in 2009 decreased $200 million
    (.7 percent), compared with 2008. Time deposits greater
    than $100,000 are managed as an alternative to other funding
    sources, such as wholesale borrowing, based largely on relative
    pricing.

Borrowings
        The Company utilizes
    both short-term and long-term borrowings to fund growth of
    assets in excess of deposit growth. Short-term borrowings, which
    include federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase
    agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other
    short-term borrowings, were $31.3 billion at
    December 31, 2009, compared with $34.0 billion at
    December 31, 2008. Short-term funding is managed within
    approved liquidity policies. The decrease of $2.7 billion
    (7.9 percent) in short-term borrowings reflected reduced
    borrowing needs as a result of increases in deposits.

Long-term debt was $32.6 billion at December 31, 2009,
    compared with $38.4 billion at December 31, 2008,
    primarily reflecting $4.5 billion of medium-term note
    maturities and repayments, $500 million of subordinated
    debt maturities and a $5.7 billion net decrease in Federal
    Home Loan Bank advances, partially offset by issuances of
    $4.5 billion of medium-term notes and $501 million of
    junior subordinated debentures during 2009. Refer to
    Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information regarding long-term debt and the
     Liquidity Risk Management  section for discussion of
    liquidity management of the Company.

Corporate Risk
    Profile  

Overview
        Managing risks is an
    essential part of successfully operating a financial services
    company. The most prominent risk exposures are credit, residual
    value, operational, interest rate, market and liquidity risk.
    Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest
     and/or  the
    principal balance of a loan, investment or derivative contract
    when it is due. Residual value risk is the potential reduction
    in the
     end-of-term 
    value of leased assets. Operational risk includes risks related
    to fraud, legal and compliance risk, processing errors,
    technology, breaches of internal controls and business
    continuation and disaster recovery risk. Interest rate risk is
    the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of
    changes in interest rates, which can affect the re-pricing of
    assets and liabilities differently. Market risk arises from
    fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
    security prices that may result in changes in the values of
    financial instruments, such as trading and
     available-for-sale 
    securities that are accounted for on a
     mark-to-market 
    basis. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund
    obligations to depositors, investors or borrowers. In addition,
    corporate strategic decisions, as well as the risks described
    above,

34     U.S. BANCORP

could give rise to reputation risk. Reputation risk is the risk
    that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could
    result in costly litigation or cause a decline in the
    Company s stock value, customer base, funding sources or
    revenue.

Credit Risk
    Management     The
    Company s strategy for credit risk management includes
    well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting
    criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for
    all commercial and consumer credit exposures. The strategy also
    emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and
    customer level, regular credit examinations and management
    reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. The
    credit risk management strategy also includes a credit risk
    assessment process, independent of business line managers, that
    performs assessments of compliance with commercial and consumer
    credit policies, risk ratings, and other critical credit
    information. The Company strives to identify potential problem
    loans early, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and
    maintain appropriate reserve levels for probable incurred loan
    losses. Commercial banking operations rely on prudent credit
    policies and procedures and individual lender and business line
    manager accountability. Lenders are assigned lending authority
    based on their level of experience and customer service
    requirements. Credit officers reporting to an independent credit
    administration function have higher levels of lending authority
    and support the business units in their credit decision process.
    Loan decisions are documented with respect to the
    borrower s business, purpose of the loan, evaluation of the
    repayment source and the associated risks, evaluation of
    collateral, covenants and monitoring requirements, and risk
    rating rationale. The Company utilizes a credit risk rating
    system to measure the credit quality of individual commercial
    loans, including the probability of default of an obligor and
    the loss given default of credit facilities. The Company uses
    the risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the
    frequency of review of the credit exposures, and evaluation and
    determination of the specific allowance for commercial credit
    losses. The Company regularly forecasts potential changes in
    risk ratings, nonperforming status and potential for loss and
    the estimated impact on the allowance for credit losses. In the
    Company s retail banking operations, standard credit
    scoring systems are used to assess credit risks of consumer,
    small business and small-ticket leasing customers and to price
    products accordingly. The Company conducts the underwriting and
    collections of its retail products in loan underwriting and
    servicing centers specializing in certain retail products.
    Forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses in
    conjunction with projection of estimated losses by delinquency
    categories and vintage information are regularly prepared and
    are used to evaluate underwriting and collection and determine
    the specific allowance for credit losses for these products.
    Because business processes and credit risks associated with
    unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for
    loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its
    liability for unfunded credit commitments. The Company also
    engages in non-lending activities that may give rise to credit
    risk, including interest rate swap and option contracts for
    balance sheet hedging purposes, foreign exchange transactions,
    deposit overdrafts and interest rate swap contracts for
    customers, and settlement risk, including Automated Clearing
    House transactions, and the processing of credit card
    transactions for merchants. These activities are also subject to
    credit review, analysis and approval processes.

Economic and
    Other Factors     In
    evaluating its credit risk, the Company considers changes, if
    any, in underwriting activities, the loan portfolio composition
    (including product mix and geographic, industry or
    customer-specific concentrations), trends in loan performance,
    the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking
    institutions and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in
    unemployment rates, gross domestic product and consumer
    bankruptcy filings.

For several years prior to mid-2007, economic conditions were
    strong, with relatively low unemployment, expanding retail
    sales, and favorable trends related to corporate profits and
    consumer spending for retail goods and services. Since mid-2007,
    corporate profit levels have weakened, unemployment rates have
    risen, vehicle and retail sales have declined and credit quality
    indicators have deteriorated substantially. In addition, the
    mortgage lending and homebuilding industries have experienced
    significant stress. Residential home inventory levels
    approximated a 8.1 month supply at the end of 2009. Median
    home prices, which peaked in mid-2006, have declined across most
    domestic markets with severe price reductions in California and
    some parts of the Southwest, Northeast and Southeast regions.

The decline in residential home values has had a significant
    adverse impact on residential mortgage loans. Residential
    mortgage delinquencies, which increased dramatically in 2007 for
     sub-prime 
    borrowers, have also increased throughout 2008 and 2009 for
    other classes of

U.S. BANCORP   35 

borrowers. Rising unemployment levels have further increased
    losses in prime-based residential portfolios and credit cards.

The unfavorable conditions that have affected the economy since
    mid-2007, intensified in 2008 and 2009. This led to an overall
    decrease in confidence in the financial markets. In response to
    liquidity pressures on short-term funding markets and stress in
    the global banking system, the U.S. Department of the
    Treasury, the FDIC and U.S. Federal Reserve System, foreign
    governments and other central banks, took a variety of measures
    to restore confidence in the financial markets and strengthen
    financial institutions, including capital injections and
    guarantees of bank liabilities. Domestically, the United States
    Congress passed a bill authorizing an increase in federal
    spending in an attempt to provide economic stimulus. In late
    2009, the domestic recession moderated by some economic
    measures, though unemployment and under-employment continue to
    be historically high, consumer confidence and spending remain
    lower, and many borrowers continue to have difficulty meeting
    their commitments. As a result, the Company expects
    nonperforming assets and charge-offs to continue to increase
    during early 2010, however at a decreasing rate as compared with
    prior quarters. The Company recorded provision for credit losses
    in excess of charge-offs during 2009 and 2008 of
    $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, as the
    result of these economic and environment factors.

Credit
    Diversification     The
    Company manages its credit risk, in part, through
    diversification of its loan portfolio and limit setting by
    product type criteria and concentrations. As part of its normal
    business activities, the Company offers a broad array of
    traditional commercial lending products and specialized products
    such as asset-based lending, commercial lease financing,
    agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage lending, commercial real
    estate, health care and correspondent banking. The Company also
    offers an array of retail lending products including credit
    cards, retail leases, home equity, revolving credit, lending to
    students and other consumer loans. These retail credit products
    are primarily offered through the branch office network, home
    mortgage and loan production offices, indirect distribution
    channels, such as automobile dealers, and a consumer finance
    division. The Company monitors and manages the portfolio
    diversification by industry, customer and geography. Table 6
    provides information with respect to the overall product
    diversification and changes in the mix during 2009.

The commercial portfolio reflects the Company s focus on
    serving small business customers, middle market and larger
    corporate businesses throughout its 24-state banking region, as
    well as large national customers. The commercial loan portfolio
    is diversified among various industries with somewhat higher
    concentrations in consumer products and services, financial
    services, commercial services and supplies, capital goods
    (including manufacturing and commercial construction-related
    businesses), property management and development and
    agricultural industries. Additionally, the commercial portfolio
    is diversified across the Company s geographical markets
    with 69.2 percent of total commercial loans, excluding
    covered assets, within the 24-state banking region. Credit
    relationships outside of the Company s banking region are
    reflected within the corporate banking, mortgage banking, auto
    dealer and leasing businesses focusing on large national
    customers and specifically targeted industries. Loans to
    mortgage banking customers are primarily warehouse lines which
    are collateralized with the underlying mortgages. The Company
    regularly monitors its mortgage collateral position to manage
    its risk exposure. Table 7 provides a summary of significant
    industry groups and geographic locations of commercial loans
    outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The commercial real estate portfolio reflects the Company s
    focus on serving business owners within its geographic footprint
    as well as regional and national investment-based real estate
    owners and builders. At December 31, 2009, the Company had
    commercial real estate loans of $34.1 billion, or
    17.5 percent of total loans, compared with
    $33.2 billion at December 31, 2008. Within commercial
    real estate loans, different property types have varying degrees
    of credit risk. Table 8 provides a summary of the significant
    property types and geographical locations of commercial real
    estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008. At
    December 31, 2009, approximately 32.1 percent of the
    commercial real estate loan portfolio represented business
    owner-occupied properties that tend to exhibit credit risk
    characteristics similar to the middle market commercial loan
    portfolio. Generally, the investment-based real estate mortgages
    are diversified among various property types with somewhat
    higher concentrations in office and retail properties. During
    2009, the Company continued to reduce its level of exposure to
    homebuilders, given the stress in the homebuilding industry
    sector. From a geographical perspective, the Company s
    commercial real estate portfolio is generally well diversified.
    However, at December 31, 2009, 21.8 percent of the
    Company s commercial real estate portfolio, excluding
    covered assets, was secured by collateral in California, which
    has experienced higher delinquency levels and credit quality

36     U.S. BANCORP

deterioration due to excess home inventory levels and declining
    valuations. During 2009, the Company recorded $614 million
    of net charge-offs in the total commercial real estate
    portfolio. Included in commercial real estate at year-end 2009
    was approximately $975 million in loans related to land
    held for development and $1.9 billion of loans related to
    residential and commercial acquisition and development
    properties. These loans are subject to quarterly monitoring for
    changes in local market conditions due to a higher credit risk
    profile. The commercial real estate portfolio is diversified
    across the Company s geographical markets with
    86.9 percent of total commercial real estate loans
    outstanding at December 31, 2009, within the 24-state
    banking region.

The assets acquired from the FDIC assisted acquisitions of
    Downey, PFF and FBOP included nonperforming loans and other
    loans with characteristics indicative of a high credit risk
    profile, including a substantial concentration in California,
    loans with
     negative-amortization 
    payment options, and homebuilder and other construction finance
    loans. Because most of these loans are covered under loss
    sharing agreements with the FDIC, the Company s financial
    exposure to losses from these assets is substantially reduced.
    To the extent actual losses exceed the Company s estimates
    at acquisition, the Company s financial risk would only be
    its share of those losses under the loss sharing agreements.

The Company s retail lending business utilizes several
    distinct business processes and channels to originate retail
    credit, including traditional branch lending, indirect lending,
    portfolio acquisitions and a consumer finance division. Each
    distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique
    credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production
    commensurate with the differing risk profiles. Within Consumer
    Banking, the consumer finance division specializes in serving
    channel-specific and alternative lending markets in residential
    mortgages, home equity and installment loan financing. The
    consumer finance division manages loans originated through a
    broker network, correspondent relationships and U.S. Bank
    branch offices. Generally, loans managed by the Company s
    consumer finance division exhibit higher credit risk
    characteristics, but are priced commensurate with the differing
    risk profile.

Residential mortgages represent an important financial product
    for consumer customers of the Company and are originated through
    the Company s branches, loan production offices, a
    wholesale network of originators and the consumer finance
    division. With respect to residential mortgages originated
    through these channels, the Company may either retain the loans
    on its balance sheet or sell its interest in the balances into
    the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and
    customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables
    the Company to effectively reduce its credit and other
    asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are
    retained in the Company s portfolio and for home equity and
    second mortgages, credit risk is also diversified by geography
    and managed by adherence to
     loan-to-value 
    and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process.

The following tables provide summary information of the
     loan-to-values 
    of residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages by
    distribution channel and type at December 31, 2009
    (excluding covered assets):

    branches.

Within the consumer finance division, at December 31, 2009
    approximately $2.5 billion of residential mortgages were to
    customers that may be defined as
     sub-prime 
    borrowers based on credit scores from independent credit rating
    agencies at the time of loan origination, compared with
    $2.9 billion at December 31, 2008.

The following table provides further information on residential
    mortgages for the consumer finance division:

In addition to residential mortgages, at December 31, 2009,
    the consumer finance division had $.6 billion of home
    equity and second mortgage loans to customers that may be
    defined as
     sub-prime 
    borrowers, compared with $.7 billion at December 31,
    2008.

The following table provides further information on home equity
    and second mortgages for the consumer finance division:

The total amount of residential mortgage, home equity and second
    mortgage loans, other than covered assets, to customers that may
    be defined as
     sub-prime 
    borrowers represented only 1.1 percent of total assets at
    December 31, 2009, compared with 1.4 percent at
    December 31, 2008. Covered assets include $2.2 billion
    in loans with
     negative-amortization 
    payment options at December 31, 2009, compared with
    $3.3 billion at December 31, 2008. Other than covered
    assets, the Company does not have any residential mortgages with
    payment schedules that would cause balances to increase over
    time.

The retail loan portfolio principally reflects the
    Company s focus on consumers within its footprint of
    branches and certain niche lending activities that are
    nationally focused. Within the Company s retail loan
    portfolio, approximately 73.4 percent of the credit card
    balances relate to cards originated through the bank branches or
    co-branded and affinity programs that generally experience
    better credit quality performance than portfolios generated
    through other channels.

Table 9 provides a geographical summary of the residential
    mortgage and retail loan portfolios.

Loan
    Delinquencies     Trends
    in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other
    considerations, of credit risk within the Company s loan
    portfolios. The entire balance of an account is considered
    delinquent if the minimum payment contractually required to be
    made is not received by the specified date on the billing
    statement. The Company measures delinquencies, both including
    and excluding nonperforming loans, to enable comparability with
    other companies. Delinquent loans purchased from Government
    National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ) mortgage pools,

    guaranteed by the federal government. Including the guaranteed
    amounts, the ratio of retail loans 90 days or more past due
    including nonperforming loans was 1.57 percent at
    December 31, 2009, and 1.10 percent at
    December 31, 2008.   

for which repayments of principal and interest are insured by
    the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the
    Department of Veterans Affairs, are excluded from delinquency
    statistics. In addition, in certain situations, a retail
    customer s account may be re-aged to remove it from
    delinquent status. Generally, the purpose of re-aging accounts
    is to assist customers who have recently overcome temporary
    financial difficulties, and have demonstrated both the ability
    and willingness to resume regular payments. To qualify for
    re-aging, the account must have been open for at least one year
    and cannot have been re-aged during the preceding 365 days.
    An account may not be re-aged more than two times in a five-year
    period. To qualify for re-aging, the customer must also have
    made three regular minimum monthly payments within the last
    90 days. In addition, the Company may re-age the retail
    account of a customer who has experienced longer-term financial
    difficulties and apply modified, concessionary terms and
    conditions to the account. Such additional re-ages are limited
    to one in a five-year period and must meet the qualifications
    for re-aging described above. All re-aging strategies must be
    independently approved by the Company s credit
    administration function. Commercial loans are not subject to
    re-aging policies.

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled
    $2.3 billion ($1.5 billion excluding covered assets)
    at December 31, 2009, compared with $1.6 billion
    ($967 million excluding covered assets) at
    December 31, 2008, and $584 million at
    December 31, 2007. The $558 million increase,
    excluding covered assets, reflected stress in residential
    mortgages, commercial loans, construction loans, credit cards
    and home equity loans. These loans are not included in
    nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because
    they are adequately secured by collateral, are in the process of
    collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or
    restoration to current status, or are managed in homogeneous
    portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to
    regulatory guidelines. The ratio of
     90-day 
    delinquent loans to total loans was 1.18 percent
    (.88 percent excluding covered assets) at December 31,
    2009, compared with .84 percent (.56 percent excluding
    covered assets) at December 31,

2008. The Company expects delinquencies to continue to increase
    during early 2010, as difficult economic conditions will likely
    affect more borrowers within both the consumer and commercial
    loan portfolios.

Restructured
    Loans Accruing Interest
        In certain
    circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to
    maximize the collection of amounts due. In most cases, the
    modification is either a reduction in interest rate, extension
    of the maturity date or a reduction in the principal balance.
    Generally, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties
    or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term so
    concessionary modification is granted to the borrower that would
    otherwise not be considered. Restructured loans accrue interest
    as long as the borrower complies with the revised terms and
    conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level
    commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles.

Many of the Company s loan restructurings occur on a
     case-by-case 
    basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes,
    however, the Company has also implemented certain restructuring
    programs. In late 2007, the consumer finance division began
    implementing a mortgage loan restructuring program for certain
    qualifying borrowers. In general, certain borrowers facing an
    interest rate reset that are current in their repayment status,
    are allowed to retain the lower of their existing interest rate
    or the market interest rate as of their interest reset date. In
    addition, the Company began participating in the
    U.S. Department of the Treasury Home Affordable
    Modification Program ( HAMP ) during the third quarter
    of 2009. HAMP gives qualifying homeowners an opportunity to
    refinance into more affordable monthly payments, with the
    U.S. Department of the Treasury compensating the Company
    for a portion of the reduction in monthly amounts due from
    borrowers participating in this program.

The Company also modified certain mortgage loans according to
    provisions in the Downey, PFF and FBOP loss sharing agreements.
    Losses associated with modifications on these loans, including
    the economic impact of interest rate reductions, are generally
    eligible for reimbursement under the loss sharing agreements.

Acquired loans restructured after acquisition are not considered
    restructured loans for purposes of the Company s accounting
    and disclosure if the loans evidenced credit deterioration as of
    the acquisition date.

The following table provides a summary of restructured loans,
    excluding covered assets, that are performing in accordance with
    the modified terms, and therefore continue to accrue interest:

(a)

Excludes
    loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are
    insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by
    the Department of Veterans Affairs.   

Restructured loans, excluding covered assets, were
    $769 million higher at December 31, 2009, than at
    December 31, 2008, primarily reflecting the impact of loan
    modifications for certain residential mortgage and consumer
    credit card customers in light of current economic conditions.
    The Company expects this trend to continue as the Company
    actively works with customers to modify loans for borrowers who
    are having financial difficulties.

Nonperforming
    Assets     The level of
    nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the
    potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include
    nonaccrual loans, restructured loans not performing in
    accordance with modified terms, other real estate and other
    nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest payments
    collected from assets on nonaccrual status are typically applied
    against the principal balance and not recorded as income.

At December 31, 2009, total nonperforming assets were
    $5.9 billion, compared with $2.6 billion at year-end
    2008 and $690 million at year-end 2007. Nonperforming
    assets at December 31, 2009, included $2.0 billion of
    covered assets, compared with $643 million at
    December 31, 2008. The majority of these nonperforming
    covered assets were considered credit-impaired at acquisition
    and recorded at their estimated fair value at acquisition. In
    addition, these assets are covered by loss sharing agreements
    with the FDIC that substantially reduce the risk of credit
    losses. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans
    and other real estate was 3.02 percent (2.25 percent
    excluding covered

U.S. BANCORP   41 

assets) at December 31, 2009, compared with
    1.42 percent (1.14 percent excluding covered assets)
    at December 31, 2008, and .45 percent at
    December 31, 2007. Excluding covered assets, the
    $1.9 billion increase in nonperforming assets was driven by
    stress in residential home construction and related industries,
    deterioration in the residential mortgage portfolio, as well as
    an increase in foreclosed properties and the impact of the
    economic slowdown on commercial and consumer customers.

Included in nonperforming loans were restructured loans that are
    not accruing interest of $492 million at December 31,
    2009, compared with $151 million at December 31, 2008.

Other real estate, excluding covered assets, was
    $437 million at December 31, 2009, compared with
    $190 million at December 31, 2008, and was primarily
    related to foreclosed properties that previously secured loan
    balances. The increase in other real estate assets reflected
    continuing stress in residential construction and related
    supplier industries.

The following table provides an analysis of other real estate
    owned ( OREO ), excluding covered assets, as a percent
    of their related loan balances, including geographical location

Net
    charge-offs as a percent of average loans outstanding, excluding
    portfolio purchases where the acquired loans were recorded at
    fair value at the purchase date, were 7.14 percent for the
    year ended December 31, 2009.   

The Company expects nonperforming assets, including OREO, to
    continue to increase in early 2010, however at a decreasing rate
    as compared with prior quarters, as difficult economic
    conditions affect more borrowers in both the commercial and
    consumer loan portfolios.

The $1.9 billion increase in total nonperforming assets at
    December 31, 2008, as compared with December 31, 2007,
    was driven primarily by stress in the residential construction
    portfolio and related industries, as well as the residential
    mortgage portfolio, an increase in foreclosed properties and the
    impact of the economic slowdown on other commercial customers.

Analysis of
    Loan Net Charge-Offs
        Total loan net
    charge-offs were $3.9 billion in 2009, compared with
    $1.8 billion in 2008 and $792 million in 2007. The
    ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans was
    2.08 percent in 2009, compared with 1.10 percent in
    2008 and .54 percent in 2007. The increase in net
    charge-offs in 2009, compared with 2008, was driven by economic
    factors affecting the residential housing markets, including
    homebuilding and related industries, commercial real estate
    properties and credit costs associated with credit card and
    other consumer and commercial loans as the economy weakened and
    unemployment increased. Given current economic conditions and
    the weakness in home prices and the economy in general, the
    Company expects net charge-offs will increase in early 2010, but
    expects the rate of increase will decline.

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs for
    2009 were $1.5 billion (1.78 percent of average loans
    outstanding), compared with $514 million (.60 percent
    of average loans outstanding) in 2008 and $159 million
    (.21 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2007. The
    increase in net charge-offs in 2009, compared with 2008 and the
    increase in 2008, compared with 2007, reflected continuing
    stress within the portfolios, especially residential
    homebuilding and commercial real estate, along with the impact
    of weak economic conditions on the commercial loan portfolios.

Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs for 2009 were
    $489 million (2.00 percent of average loans
    outstanding), compared with $234 million (1.01 percent
    of average loans outstanding) in 2008 and $61 million
    (.28 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2007. Retail
    loan net charge-offs for 2009 were $1.8 billion
    (2.95 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with
    $1.1 billion (1.92 percent of average loans
    outstanding) in 2008 and $572 million (1.17 percent of
    average loans outstanding) in 2007. The increases in residential
    mortgage and retail loan net charge-offs in 2009, compared with
    2008, reflected the adverse impact of current economic
    conditions on consumers, as rising unemployment levels increased
    losses in prime-based residential portfolios and credit cards.
    The increases in 2008, compared with 2007, reflected decreasing
    residential real estate values in some markets and growth in
    credit card and

other consumer loan balances, as well as the adverse impact of
    weak economic conditions on consumers.

Analysis and
    Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses
        The allowance for
    loan losses reserves for probable and estimable losses incurred
    in the Company s loan and lease portfolio, and considers
    credit loss protection from loss sharing agreements with the
    FDIC. Management evaluates the allowance each quarter to ensure
    it appropriately reserves for incurred losses. The evaluation of
    each element and the overall allowance is based on a continuing
    assessment of problem loans, recent loss experience and other
    factors, including regulatory guidance and economic conditions.
    Because business processes and credit risks associated with
    unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for
    loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its
    liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in
    other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the
    allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit
    commitments are included in the Company s analysis of
    credit losses and reported reserve ratios.

At December 31, 2009, the allowance for credit losses was
    $5.3 billion (2.69 percent of total loans and
    3.04 percent of loans excluding covered assets), compared
    with an allowance of $3.6 billion (1.96 percent of
    total loans and 2.09 percent of loans excluding covered
    assets) at December 31, 2008, and $2.3 billion
    (1.47 percent of total loans) at December 31, 2007.
    The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming
    loans was 97 percent (153 percent excluding covered
    assets) at December 31, 2009, compared with
    151 percent (206 percent excluding covered assets) and
    406 percent at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to
    loan net charge-offs at December 31, 2009, was
    136 percent (both including and excluding covered assets),
    compared with 200 percent (201 percent excluding
    covered assets) and 285 percent at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Management determined the allowance for
    credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2009.

Several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the
    allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2009, including
    the risk profile of the portfolios, loan net charge-offs during
    the period, the level of nonperforming assets, accruing loans
    90 days or more past due, delinquency ratios and changes in
    restructured loan balances. Management also considered the
    uncertainty related to certain industry sectors, and the extent
    of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio.
    In addition, concentration risks associated with commercial real
    estate and the mix of loans, including credit cards, loans
    originated through the consumer finance division and residential
    mortgages balances, and their relative credit risks, were
    evaluated. Finally, the Company considered current economic
    conditions that might impact the portfolio. Management
    determines the allowance that is required for specific loan
    categories based on relative risk characteristics of the loan
    portfolio. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its methods
    for determining the allowance for each element of the portfolio
    and makes enhancements considered appropriate. Table 17 shows
    the amount of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio
    category.

Table
    17        Elements
    of the Allowance for Credit Losses 

Regardless of the extent of the Company s analysis of
    customer performance, portfolio trends or risk management
    processes, certain incurred but undetected losses are probable
    within the loan portfolios. This is due to several factors,
    including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a
    customer s financial condition or changes in its unique
    business conditions, the judgmental nature of individual loan
    evaluations, collateral assessments and the interpretation of
    economic trends. Volatility of economic or customer-specific
    conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses
    from larger non-homogeneous credits and the sensitivity of
    assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogeneous
    groups of loans, loan portfolio concentrations, and additional
    subjective considerations are among other factors. Because of
    these subjective factors, the process utilized to determine each
    element of the allowance for credit losses by specific loan
    category has some imprecision. As such, the Company estimates a
    range of incurred losses in the portfolio based on statistical
    analyses and management judgment. A statistical analysis
    attempts to measure the extent of imprecision and other
    uncertainty by determining the volatility of losses over time,
    across loan categories. Also, management judgmentally considers
    loan concentrations, risks associated with specific industries,
    the stage of the business cycle, economic conditions and other
    qualitative factors. Beginning in 2007, the Company assigned
    this element of the allowance to each portfolio type to better
    reflect the Company s risk in the specific portfolios. In
    years prior to 2007, this element of the allowance was
    separately categorized as  available for other
    factors .

The allowance recorded for commercial and commercial real estate
    loans is based, in part, on a regular review of individual
    credit relationships. The Company s risk rating process is
    an integral component of the methodology utilized to determine
    these elements of the allowance for credit losses. An allowance
    for credit losses is established for pools of commercial and
    commercial real estate loans and unfunded commitments based on
    the risk ratings assigned. An analysis of the migration of
    commercial and commercial real estate loans and actual loss
    experience is conducted quarterly to assess the exposure for
    credits with similar risk characteristics. In addition to its
    risk rating process, the Company separately analyzes the
    carrying value of impaired loans to determine whether the
    carrying value is less than or equal to the appraised collateral
    value or the present value of expected cash flows. Based on this
    analysis, an allowance for credit losses may be specifically
    established for impaired loans. The allowance established for
    commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios, including
    impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans, was
    $2.2 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with
    $1.4 billion at December 31, 2008, and
    $1.3 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in the
    allowance for commercial and commercial real estate loans of

U.S. BANCORP   47 

$770 million at December 31, 2009, compared with
    December 31, 2008, reflected continuing stress in
    commercial real estate and residential housing, especially
    residential homebuilding and related industry sectors, along
    with the impact of the current economic conditions on the
    commercial loan portfolios.

The allowance recorded for the residential mortgages and retail
    loan portfolios is based on an analysis of product mix, credit
    scoring and risk composition of the portfolio, loss and
    bankruptcy experiences, economic conditions and historical and
    expected delinquency and charge-off statistics for each
    homogenous group of loans. Based on this information and
    analysis, an allowance was established approximating a
    twelve-month estimate of net charge-offs. For homogenous loans
    modified under a troubled debt restructuring, an allowance was
    established for any impairment to the recorded investment in the
    loan. The allowance established for residential mortgages was
    $672 million at December 31, 2009, compared with
    $524 million and $131 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The allowance established for
    retail loans was $2.4 billion at December 31, 2009,
    compared with $1.6 billion and $865 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in
    the allowance for the residential mortgage and retail portfolios
    in 2009 reflected the adverse impact of current economic
    conditions on customers, as rising unemployment levels have
    increased losses in prime-based residential portfolios and
    credit cards.

The evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit
    losses for purchased non-impaired loans acquired on or after
    January 1, 2009 considers credit discounts recorded as a
    part of the initial determination of the fair value of the
    loans. For these loans, no allowance for credit losses is
    recorded at the purchase date. Credit discounts representing the
    principal losses expected over the life of the loans are a
    component of the initial fair value. Subsequent to the purchase
    date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance
    for credit losses for these loans is similar to originated
    loans, however, the Company records a provision for loan losses
    only when the required allowance, net of any expected
    reimbursement under any loss sharing agreements with the FDIC,
    exceeds any remaining credit discounts.

The evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit
    losses for purchased impaired loans considers the expected cash
    flows to be collected from the borrower. These loans are
    initially recorded at fair value and therefore no allowance for
    loan losses is recorded at the purchase date. Subsequent to the
    purchase date, the expected cash flows of the impaired loans are
    subject to evaluation. Decreases in the present value of
    expected cash flows are recognized by recording an allowance for
    credit losses, net of any expected reimbursement under loss
    sharing agreements with the FDIC.

Although the Company determines the amount of each element of
    the allowance separately and considers this process to be an
    important credit management tool, the entire allowance for
    credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The
    actual amount of losses incurred can vary significantly from the
    estimated amounts.

Residual Value
    Risk Management     The
    Company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of
    leased assets through disciplined residual valuation setting at
    the inception of a lease, diversification of its leased assets,
    regular residual asset valuation reviews and monitoring of
    residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets.
    Commercial lease originations are subject to the same
    well-defined underwriting standards referred to in the
     Credit Risk Management  section which includes an
    evaluation of the residual value risk. Retail lease residual
    value risk is mitigated further by originating longer-term
    vehicle leases and effective
     end-of-term 
    marketing of off-lease vehicles.

Included in the retail leasing portfolio was approximately
    $2.9 billion of retail leasing residuals at
    December 31, 2009, compared with $3.2 billion at
    December 31, 2008. The Company monitors concentrations of
    leases by manufacturer and vehicle  make and model. 
    As of December 31, 2009, vehicle lease residuals related to
    sport utility vehicles were 41.0 percent of the portfolio
    while upscale and mid-range vehicle classes represented
    approximately 26.4 percent and 14.8 percent,
    respectively. At year-end 2009, the largest vehicle-type
    concentration represented approximately 6 percent of the
    aggregate residual value of the vehicles in the portfolio.

Because retail residual valuations tend to be less volatile for
    longer-term leases, relative to the estimated residual at
    inception of the lease, the Company actively manages lease
    origination production to achieve a longer-term portfolio. At
    December 31, 2009, the weighted-average origination term of
    the portfolio was 45 months, compared with 47 months
    at December 31, 2008. During the several years prior to
    2008, vehicle sales volumes experienced strong growth driven by
    manufacturer incentives, consumer spending levels and strong
    economic conditions. In 2008, sales of used vehicles softened
    due to the overall weakening of the economy. As a result, the
    Company s portfolio experienced deterioration in residual
    values in 2008 in all categories, most notably sport utility
    vehicles and luxury models, as a

48     U.S. BANCORP

result of higher fuel prices and weak economic conditions. In
    2009, sales of vehicles were affected by the financial condition
    of the automobile manufacturers and various government programs
    and involvement with the manufacturers. Used vehicle pricing
    improved substantially throughout 2009. As a result, residual
    value losses for the retail leasing portfolio decreased in 2009,
    compared with 2008. Currently, management expects used vehicle
    values in 2010 to remain at levels similar to those experienced
    in 2009.

At December 31, 2009, the commercial leasing portfolio had
    $701 million of residuals, compared with $690 million
    at December 31, 2008. At year-end 2009, lease residuals
    related to trucks and other transportation equipment were
    30.1 percent of the total residual portfolio. Business and
    office equipment represented 18.3 percent of the aggregate
    portfolio, while railcars and aircraft were 16.3 percent
    and 10.1 percent, respectively. No other significant
    concentrations of more than 10 percent existed at
    December 31, 2009.

Operational
    Risk Management
        Operational risk
    represents the risk of loss resulting from the Company s
    operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by
    employees or persons outside the Company, the execution of
    unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to
    transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal
    control system and compliance requirements, and business
    continuation and disaster recovery. This risk of loss also
    includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a
    result of an operational deficiency or as a result of
    noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse
    business decisions or their implementation, and customer
    attrition due to potential negative publicity.

The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse
    markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems
    to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is
    inherent in all business activities, and the management of this
    risk is important to the achievement of the Company s
    objectives. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control
    system, improper operation of systems or improper
    employees  actions, the Company could suffer financial
    loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.

The Company manages operational risk through a risk management
    framework and its internal control processes. Within this
    framework, the Risk Management Committee of the Company s
    Board of Directors provides oversight and assesses the most
    significant operational risks facing the Company within its
    business lines. Under the guidance of the Risk Management
    Committee, enterprise risk management personnel establish
    policies and interact with business lines to monitor significant
    operating risks on a regular basis. Business lines have direct
    and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying,
    controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their
    business activities. Business managers maintain a system of
    controls with the objective of providing proper transaction
    authorization and execution, proper system operations,
    safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the
    reliability of financial and other data. Business managers
    ensure that the controls are appropriate and are implemented as
    designed.

Each business line within the Company has designated risk
    managers. These risk managers are responsible for, among other
    things, coordinating the completion of ongoing risk assessments
    and ensuring that operational risk management is integrated into
    business decision-making activities. The Company s internal
    audit function validates the system of internal controls through
    regular and ongoing risk-based audit procedures and reports on
    the effectiveness of internal controls to executive management
    and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Management
    also provides various operational risk related reporting to the
    Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.

Customer-related business conditions may also increase
    operational risk, or the level of operational losses in certain
    transaction processing business units, including merchant
    processing activities. Ongoing risk monitoring of customer
    activities and their financial condition and operational
    processes serve to mitigate customer-related operational risk.
    Refer to Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion on merchant processing.
    Business continuation and disaster recovery planning is also
    critical to effectively managing operational risks. Each
    business unit of the Company is required to develop, maintain
    and test these plans at least annually to ensure that recovery
    activities, if needed, can support mission critical functions,
    including technology, networks and data centers supporting
    customer applications and business operations.

While the Company believes that it has designed effective
    methods to minimize operational risks, there is no absolute
    assurance that business disruption or operational losses would
    not occur in the event of a disaster. On an ongoing basis,
    management makes process changes and investments to enhance its
    systems of internal controls and business continuity and
    disaster recovery plans.

Interest Rate
    Risk Management     In
    the banking industry, changes in interest rates are a
    significant risk that can impact earnings, market valuations and
    safety and soundness of an entity. To minimize the volatility of
    net interest income and the market value of assets and
    liabilities, the Company manages its exposure to changes in
    interest rates through asset and liability management activities
    within guidelines established by its Asset Liability Committee
    ( ALCO ) and approved by the Board of Directors. The
    ALCO has the responsibility for approving and ensuring
    compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest
    rate risk exposure. The Company uses net interest income
    simulation analysis and market value of equity modeling for
    measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk.

Net Interest
    Income Simulation Analysis
        One of the primary
    tools used to measure interest rate risk and the effect of
    interest rate changes on net interest income is simulation
    analysis. The monthly analysis incorporates substantially all of
    the Company s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet
    instruments, together with forecasted changes in the balance
    sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate
    environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the
    impact on net interest income of a 200 basis point
    ( bps ) upward or downward gradual change of market
    interest rates over a one-year period. The simulation also
    estimates the effect of immediate and sustained parallel shifts
    in the yield curve of 50 bps as well as the effect of
    immediate and sustained flattening or steepening of the yield
    curve. This simulation includes assumptions about how the
    balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and
    deposit growth. Assumptions are made to project interest rates
    for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis,
    management s outlook and re-pricing strategies. These
    assumptions are validated on a periodic basis. A sensitivity
    analysis is provided for key variables of the simulation. The
    results are reviewed by the ALCO monthly and are used to guide
    asset/liability management strategies.

The table below summarizes the projected impact to net interest
    income over the next 12 months of various potential
    interest rate changes. The Company manages its interest rate
    risk position by holding assets on the balance sheet with
    desired interest rate risk characteristics, implementing certain
    pricing strategies for loans and deposits and through the
    selection of derivatives and various funding and investment
    portfolio strategies. The Company manages the overall interest
    rate risk profile within policy limits. The ALCO policy limits
    the estimated change in net interest income in a gradual
    200 bps rate change scenario to a 4.0 percent decline
    of forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months.
    At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company was within this
    policy.

Market Value
    of Equity Modeling
        The Company also
    manages interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value of
    equity modeling, which measures the degree to which the market
    values of the Company s assets and liabilities and
    off-balance sheet instruments will change given a change in
    interest rates. The ALCO policy limits the change in market
    value of equity in a 200 bps parallel rate shock to a
    15.0 percent decline. A 200 bps increase would have
    resulted in a 4.3 percent decrease in the market value of
    equity at December 31, 2009, compared with a
    7.6 percent decrease at December 31, 2008. A
    200 bps decrease would have resulted in a 2.8 percent
    decrease in the market value of equity at December 31,
    2009, compared with a 2.8 percent decrease at
    December 31, 2008.

The valuation analysis is dependent upon certain key assumptions
    about the nature of assets and liabilities with non-contractual
    maturities. Management estimates the average life and rate
    characteristics of asset and liability accounts based upon
    historical analysis and management s expectation of rate
    behavior. These assumptions are validated on a periodic basis. A
    sensitivity analysis of key variables of the valuation analysis
    is provided to the ALCO monthly and is used to guide
    asset/liability management strategies.

Use of
    Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks
        To reduce the
    sensitivity of earnings to interest rate, prepayment, credit,
    price and foreign currency fluctuations ( asset and
    liability management positions ), the Company enters into
    derivative transactions. The Company uses

    the current level of interest rates, a downward rate scenario
    can not be computed.

derivatives for asset and liability management purposes
    primarily in the following ways:

To convert fixed-rate debt, issued to finance the Company, from
    fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments;

To convert the cash flows associated with floating-rate debt,
    issued to finance the Company, from floating-rate payments to
    fixed-rate payments; and

To mitigate changes in value of the Company s mortgage
    origination pipeline, mortgage loans held for sale and MSRs.

To manage these risks, the Company may enter into
    exchange-traded and
     over-the-counter 
    derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, swaptions,
    futures, forwards and options. In addition, the Company enters
    into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to
    accommodate the business requirements of its customers
    ( customer-related positions ). The Company minimizes
    the market and liquidity risks of customer-related positions by
    entering into similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers.
    The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative
    purposes.

The Company does not designate all of the derivatives it enters
    into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because
    of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements. In
    particular, the Company enters into U.S. Treasury futures,
    options on U.S. Treasury futures contracts and forward
    commitments to buy residential mortgage loans to mitigate
    fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not designate
    those derivatives as accounting hedges.

Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell
    residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically
    hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan
    production activities. At December 31, 2009, the Company
    had $8.3 billion of forward commitments to sell mortgage
    loans hedging $4.3 billion of mortgage loans held for sale
    and $5.7 billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments. The
    forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan
    commitments are considered derivatives under the accounting
    guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and
    hedge activities, and the Company has elected the fair value
    option for the mortgage loans held for sale.

Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with
    counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with
    derivatives is measured by the Company based on the probability
    of counterparty default. The Company manages the credit risk of
    its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among
    various counterparties, entering into master netting agreements
    with its counterparties, requiring collateral agreements with
    credit-rating thresholds and, in certain cases, though
    insignificant, transferring the counterparty credit risk related
    to interest rate swaps to third-parties through the use of risk
    participation agreements.

For additional information on derivatives and hedging
    activities, refer to Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Market Risk
    Management     In
    addition to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to other
    forms of market risk as a consequence of conducting normal
    trading activities. These trading activities principally support
    the risk management processes of the Company s customers,
    including their management of foreign currency, interest rate
    risks and funding activities. The Company also manages market
    risk of non-trading business activities, including its MSRs and
    loans
     held-for-sale. 
    The Company uses a Value at Risk ( VaR ) approach to
    measure general market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the
    amount the Company has at risk of loss to adverse market
    movements over a specified time horizon. The Company measures
    VaR at the ninety-ninth percentile using distributions derived
    from past market data. On average, the Company expects the one
    day VaR to be exceeded two to three times per year. The Company
    monitors the effectiveness of its risk program by back-testing
    the performance of its VaR models, regularly updating the
    historical data used by the VaR models and stress testing. As
    part of its market risk management approach, the Company sets
    and monitors VaR limits for each trading portfolio. The
    Company s trading VaR did not exceed $4 million during
    2009 and $1 million during 2008.

Liquidity Risk
    Management     The ALCO
    establishes policies and guidelines, as well as analyzes and
    manages liquidity, to ensure that adequate funds are available
    to meet normal operating requirements in addition to unexpected
    customer demands for funds, such as high levels of deposit
    withdrawals or loan demand, in a timely and cost-effective
    manner. The most important factor in the preservation of
    liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the
    retention and growth of a large, stable supply of core deposits
    and wholesale funds.

During 2008 and 2009, the financial markets were challenging for
    many financial institutions. As a result of these financial
    market conditions, many banks experienced liquidity constraints,
    substantially increased pricing to retain deposits or utilized
    the Federal Reserve System discount

window to secure adequate funding. In an effort to restore
    confidence in the financial system and strengthen financial
    institutions, the United States Congress temporarily increased
    the standard FDIC coverage limit on deposits from $100,000 per
    depositor to $250,000 per depositor. This increase is effective
    through the end of 2013. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of
    2008, the FDIC instituted the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
    Program ( TLGP ). The TLGP consists of two components.
    First, the FDIC guaranteed, for a fee, certain new senior
    unsecured debt issued by a bank, thrift or bank holding company
    in 2009. The Company issued $2.7 billion of debt under this
    program, but did not participate after issuing non-guaranteed
    debt in May 2009. Second, for a fee, the program provides
    unlimited FDIC coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction
    deposit accounts. The Company participated in the transaction
    account guarantee program through 2009, but has elected not to
    participate beyond 2009.

Ultimately, public confidence is generated through profitable
    operations, sound credit quality and a strong capital position.
    The Company s performance in these areas has enabled it to
    develop a large and reliable base of core deposit funding within
    its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets.
    This has allowed the Company to maintain a strong liquidity
    position, as depositors and investors in the wholesale funding
    markets seek stable financial institutions. Liquidity management
    is viewed from long-term and short-term perspectives, as well as
    from an asset and liability perspective. Management monitors
    liquidity through a regular review of maturity profiles, funding
    sources, and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk.

The ALCO reviews the Company s ability to meet funding
    requirements due to adverse business or market events. The
    Company stresses its liquidity position regularly and maintains
    contingency plans that reflect its access to diversified funding
    sources. Also, the Company s liquidity policies require
    diversification of wholesale funding sources to avoid maturity,
    name and market concentrations. Certain subsidiary companies are
    members of various Federal Home Loan Banks ( FHLB )
    that provide a source of funding through FHLB advances. The
    Company maintains a Grand Cayman branch for issuing eurodollar
    time deposits. In addition, the Company establishes
    relationships with dealers to issue national market retail and
    institutional savings certificates and short-term and
    medium-term bank notes. The Company s subsidiary banks also
    have significant correspondent banking networks and
    relationships. Accordingly, the Company has access to national
    fed funds, funding through repurchase agreements and sources of
    stable, regionally-based certificates of deposit and commercial
    paper.

The Company s ability to raise negotiated funding at
    competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies  views
    of the Company s credit quality, liquidity, capital and
    earnings. Table 18 details the rating agencies  most recent
    assessments.

The parent company s routine funding requirements consist
    primarily of operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders,
    debt service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for
    acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its
    obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and
    the issuance of debt securities.

Under United States Securities and Exchange Commission rules,
    the parent company is classified as a  well-known seasoned
    issuer,  which allows it to file a registration statement
    that does not have a limit on issuance

capacity.  Well-known seasoned issuers  generally
    include those companies with outstanding common securities with
    a market value of at least $700 million held by
    non-affiliated parties or those companies that have issued at
    least $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of
    non-convertible securities, other than common equity, in the
    last three years. However, the parent company s ability to
    issue debt and other securities under a registration statement
    filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
    under these rules is limited by the debt issuance authority
    granted by the Company s Board of Directors
     and/or  the
    ALCO policy.

At December 31, 2009, parent company long-term debt
    outstanding was $14.5 billion, compared with
    $10.8 billion at December 31, 2008. Long-term debt
    activity in 2009 included issuances of $2.7 billion of
    medium-term notes guaranteed under the TLGP and
    $1.8 billion of notes not guaranteed under this program,
    and $.5 billion of junior subordinated debentures. These
    issuances were partially offset by $1.0 billion of
    medium-term note maturities. Total parent company debt scheduled
    to mature in 2010 is $4.8 billion. These debt obligations
    may be met through medium-term note and capital security
    issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as from
    parent company cash and cash equivalents. During 2009, the
    Company raised $2.7 billion through the sale of its common
    stock.

Federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may
    be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval. The
    amount of dividends available to the parent company from its
    banking subsidiaries after meeting the regulatory capital
    requirements for well-capitalized banks was approximately
    $2.8 billion at December 31, 2009. For further
    information, see Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements
        Off-balance sheet
    arrangements include any contractual arrangement to which an
    unconsolidated entity is a party, under which the Company has an
    obligation to provide credit or liquidity enhancements or market
    risk support. Off-balance sheet arrangements include certain
    defined guarantees, asset securitization trusts and conduits.
    Off-balance sheet arrangements also include any obligation under
    a variable interest held by an unconsolidated entity that
    provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk
    support.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into an
    array of commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and
    various forms of guarantees that may be considered off-balance
    sheet arrangements. The nature and extent of these arrangements
    are provided in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

The Company has not significantly utilized asset securitizations
    or conduits as a source of funding. The Company sponsors an
    off-balance sheet conduit to which it transferred high-grade
    investment securities in previous years, initially funded by the
    conduit s issuance of commercial paper. The conduit held
    assets of $.6 billion at December 31, 2009, compared
    with $.8 billion at December 31, 2008. During 2008,
    the conduit ceased issuing commercial paper and began to draw
    upon a Company-provided liquidity facility to replace
    outstanding commercial paper as it matured. At December 31,
    2009, the amount advanced to the conduit under the liquidity
    facility was $.7 billion, compared with $.9 billion at
    December 31, 2008, and was recorded on the Company s
    balance sheet in commercial loans.

Under accounting rules applicable through 2009, the Company
    considered the conduit to be a variable interest

U.S. BANCORP   53 

Table
    20        Regulatory
    Capital Ratios 

entity. The Company was not the primary beneficiary of the
    conduit as it did not absorb the majority of the variability of
    the conduit s cash flows or fair value. The Company will
    consolidate the conduit beginning in 2010 as a result of a
    change in the accounting rules related to variable interest
    entities.

Capital
    Management     The
    Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong
    protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum
    shareholder benefit. The Company continually assesses its
    business risks and capital position. The Company also manages
    its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for
    well-capitalized bank holding companies. To achieve these
    capital goals, the Company employs a variety of capital
    management tools, including dividends, common share repurchases,
    and the issuance of subordinated debt, common stock and other
    capital instruments.

On May 7, 2009, the Federal Reserve completed an assessment
    of the capital adequacy of the nineteen largest domestic bank
    holding companies. Based on the results of their capital
    adequacy assessment, the Federal Reserve projected the
    Company s capital would be sufficient under the Federal
    Reserve s projected scenarios. Following a
    $2.7 billion sale of common stock and issuance of
    $1.0 billion of non-guaranteed medium-term notes, the
    Company received approval to redeem the $6.6 billion of
    preferred stock previously issued to the U.S. Department of
    the Treasury on November 14, 2008, under the Capital
    Purchase Program of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of
    2008. The Company completed the redemption of the preferred
    stock on June 17, 2009, and on July 15, 2009,
    repurchased the common stock warrant issued in conjunction with
    the preferred stock from the U.S. Department of the
    Treasury for $139 million. Refer to Note 15 in the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    information.

The Company repurchased an immaterial number of shares of its
    common stock in 2009, compared with 2 million shares in
    2008, under various authorizations approved by its Board of
    Directors. The average price paid for the shares repurchased in
    2009 was $14.02 per share, compared with $33.59 per share in
    2008. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had
    approximately 20 million shares that may yet be purchased
    under the current Board of Director approved authorization. For
    a complete analysis of activities impacting shareholders 
    equity and capital management programs, refer to Note 15 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders  equity was
    $26.0 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with
    $26.3 billion at December 31, 2008. The decrease was
    principally the result of the preferred stock redemption and
    repurchase of the common stock warrant, partially offset by
    corporate earnings, the proceeds from the public offering of the
    Company s common stock and changes in unrealized

Banking regulators define minimum capital requirements for banks
    and financial services holding companies. These requirements are
    expressed in the form of a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio,
    total risk-based capital ratio, and Tier 1 leverage ratio.
    The minimum required level for these ratios is 4.0 percent,
    8.0 percent, and 4.0 percent, respectively. The
    Company targets its regulatory capital levels, at both the bank
    and bank holding company level, to exceed the
     well-capitalized  threshold for these ratios of
    6.0 percent, 10.0 percent, and 5.0 percent,
    respectively. The most recent notification from the Office of
    the Comptroller of the Currency categorized each of the
    Company s banks as  well-capitalized , under the
    FDIC Improvement Act prompt corrective action provisions
    applicable to all banks. There are no conditions or events since
    that notification that management believes have changed the
    risk-based category of any covered subsidiary banks.

As an approved mortgage seller and servicer, U.S. Bank
    National Association, through its mortgage banking division, is
    required to maintain various levels of shareholders 
    equity, as specified by various agencies, including the United
    States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Government
    National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage
    Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association. At
    December 31, 2009, U.S. Bank National Association met
    these requirements.

Table 20 provides a summary of capital ratios as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, including Tier 1 and total
    risk-based capital ratios, as defined by the regulatory agencies.

The Company believes certain capital ratios in addition to
    regulatory capital ratios are useful in evaluating its capital
    adequacy. The Company s Tier 1 common and tangible
    common equity, as a percent of risk-weighted assets, was
    6.8 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively, at
    December 31, 2009, compared with 5.1 percent and
    3.7 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The
    Company s tangible common equity divided by tangible assets
    was 5.3 percent at December 31, 2009, compared with
    3.3 percent at December 31, 2008. Refer to
     Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios  for further
    information regarding the calculation of these measures.

    U.S. Bancorp of $602 million for the fourth quarter of
    2009, or $.30 per diluted common share, compared with
    $330 million, or $.15 per diluted common share, for the
    fourth quarter of 2008. Return on average assets and return on
    average common equity were .86 percent and
    9.6 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2009,
    compared with returns of .51 percent and 5.3 percent,
    respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2008. In light of the
    credit deterioration arising from the current economic
    environment, the Company strengthened its allowance for credit
    losses in the fourth quarter of 2009 by recording
    $278 million of provision for credit losses in excess of
    net charge-offs. The Company also recorded $158 million of
    net securities losses in the fourth quarter, including
    $179 million of impairments, partially offset by
    $21 million of net gains on the sale of securities. The
    $179 million of impairments was principally due to the
    anticipated exchange of a structured investment vehicle for its
    underlying securities. This structured investment vehicle was
    purchased from an affiliate in the fourth quarter of 2007 and
    represents the last such investment expected to be restructured
    through an exchange of securities. Significant items reflected
    in the fourth quarter of 2008 results included $635 million
    of provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs,
    $253 million of net securities losses and a Visa Gain of
    $59 million.

Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis for the fourth
    quarter of 2009, was $752 million (20.8 percent)
    higher than the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting a
    9.2 percent increase in net interest income and a
    37.8 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase
    in net interest income from 2008 was largely the result of
    growth in average earning assets and an increase in lower cost
    core deposit funding, both of which reflected acquisitions.
    Noninterest income increased principally due to growth in
    mortgage banking revenue, a decrease in net securities losses,
    and lower retail lease residual valuation losses, partially
    offset by the fourth quarter 2008 Visa Gain.

Fourth quarter net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent
    basis was $2.4 billion, compared with $2.2 billion in
    the fourth quarter of 2008. Average earning assets for the
    period increased over the fourth quarter of 2008 by
    $19.4 billion (8.6 percent), driven by an increase of
    $14.4 billion (8.2 percent) in average loans and
    $2.2 billion (5.2 percent) in average investment
    securities. The net interest margin in the fourth quarter of
    2009 was 3.83 percent, compared with 3.81 percent in
    the fourth quarter of 2008.

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2009 was
    $2.0 billion, compared with $1.5 billion in the same
    period of 2008, an increase of $553 million
    (37.8 percent).

U.S. BANCORP   55 

Mortgage banking revenue increased $195 million as the
    lower interest rate environment drove strong mortgage loan
    production and related gains, the net change in the valuation of
    MSRs and related economic hedging activities was favorable and
    servicing income increased. Other income increased
    $184 million due to lower retail lease residual valuation
    losses, improving equity investment revenue and a
    payments-related contract termination gain, partially offset by
    the 2008 Visa Gain. In addition, net securities losses decreased
    $95 million. The increase in noninterest income was also
    due to higher fee-based payments-related income of
    $70 million (10.3 percent) and an increase in
    commercial products revenue of $54 million
    (41.2 percent) due to stronger capital markets, standby
    letters of credit and other commercial loan fees. Trust and
    investment management fees declined $23 million
    (7.7 percent) due to lower account-level fees and the
    impact of interest rates on money market investment fees.
    Investment product fees and commissions decreased
    $10 million (27.0 percent) due to lower sales levels from a
    year ago. Deposit service charges decreased $22 million
    (8.5 percent) primarily due to a decrease in the number of
    overdraft incidences, which more than offset deposit account
    growth.

Noninterest expense was $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter
    of 2009, an increase of $290 million (15.0 percent)
    from the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in noninterest
    expense was principally due to the impact of acquisitions, and
    higher FDIC deposit insurance expense, marketing and business
    development expense and costs related to investments in
    affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects.
    Compensation expense increased $46 million
    (6.0 percent) and employee benefits increased
    $21 million (16.9 percent), reflecting acquisitions
    and higher pension costs. Net occupancy and equipment expense
    increased $12 million (5.9 percent) and professional
    services expense increased $8 million (11.0 percent)
    due principally to acquisitions and other business initiatives.
    Marketing and business development expense increased
    $15 million (16.7 percent) due to costs related to the
    introduction of new credit card products, while technology and

communications expense increased $30 million
    (19.2 percent), primarily due to payments-related
    initiatives. Other intangibles expense increased
    $14 million (15.1 percent) due to acquisitions. Other
    expense increased $151 million (42.8 percent) due to
    higher FDIC deposit insurance expense, costs related to
    investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged
    projects, higher merchant processing expenses, growth in
    mortgage servicing expenses and costs associated with OREO.

The provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2009
    was $1.4 billion, an increase of $121 million
    (9.6 percent) over the same period of 2008. The provision
    for credit losses exceeded net charge-offs by $278 million
    in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $635 million
    in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in the provision for
    credit losses from 2008 reflected deterioration in economic
    conditions during most of the year and the corresponding impact
    on the commercial, commercial real estate and consumer loan
    portfolios. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2009 were
    $1.1 billion, compared with net charge-offs of
    $632 million during the fourth quarter of 2008.

The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2009
    resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.2 percent compared
    with an effective tax rate of 7.1 percent in the fourth
    quarter of 2008. The increase in the effective rate for the
    fourth quarter of 2009, compared with the same period of the
    prior year, principally reflected the marginal impact of higher
    pre-tax earnings
     year-over-year. 

Line of Business
    Financial Review  

The Company s major lines of business are Wholesale
    Banking, Consumer Banking, Wealth Management  
    Securities Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and
    Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of
    the Company about which financial information is prepared and is
    evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate
    resources and assess performance.

Basis for
    Financial Presentation
        Business line
    results are derived from the Company s business unit
    profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing
    managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and
    their related income or expense. Goodwill and other intangible
    assets are assigned to the lines of business based on the mix of
    business of the acquired entity. Within the Company, capital
    levels are evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is
    allocated to the operating segments to support evaluation of
    business performance. Business lines are allocated capital on a
    risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital
    requirements. Generally, the determination of the amount of
    capital allocated to each business line includes credit and
    operational capital allocations following a Basel II
    regulatory framework. Interest income and expense is determined
    based on the assets and liabilities managed by the business
    line. Because funding and asset liability management is a
    central function, funds transfer-pricing methodologies are
    utilized to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds
    provided to all business line assets and liabilities,
    respectively, using a matched funding concept. Also, each
    business unit is allocated the taxable-equivalent benefit of
    tax-exempt products. The residual effect on net interest income
    of asset/liability management activities is included in Treasury
    and Corporate Support. Noninterest income and expenses directly
    managed by each business line, including fees, service charges,
    salaries and benefits, and other direct revenues and costs are
    accounted for within each segment s financial results in a
    manner similar to the consolidated financial statements.
    Occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities
    by the lines of business. Generally, operating losses are
    charged to the line of business when the loss event is realized
    in a manner similar to a loan charge-off. Noninterest expenses
    incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that
    directly support another business line s operations are
    charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization
    of those services primarily measured by the volume of customer
    activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These
    allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense
    within noninterest expense. Certain activities that do not
    directly support the operations of the lines of business or for
    which the lines of business are not considered financially
    accountable in evaluating their performance are not charged to
    the lines of business. The income or expenses associated with
    these corporate activities is reported within the Treasury and
    Corporate Support line of business. Income taxes are assessed to
    each line of business at a standard tax rate with the residual
    tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective
    tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.

Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to
    time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating
    performance or product lines change or business segments are
    realigned to better respond to the Company s diverse
    customer base. During 2009, certain organization and methodology
    changes were made,

U.S. BANCORP   57 

including those to more closely align capital allocation with
    Basel II requirements and to allocate the provision for
    credit losses based on net charge-offs and changes in the risks
    of specific loan portfolios. Previously, the provision in excess
    of net charge-offs remained in Treasury and Corporate Support,
    and the other lines of business  results included only the
    portion of the provision for credit losses equal to net
    charge-offs. Accordingly, 2008 results were restated and
    presented on a comparable basis. Due to organizational and
    methodology changes, the Company s basis of financial
    presentation differed in 2007. The presentation of comparative
    business line results for 2007 is not practical and has not been
    provided.

    Banking     Wholesale
    Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket
    leasing, depository, treasury management, capital markets,
    foreign exchange, international trade services and other
    financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial
    real estate, financial institution and public sector clients.
    Wholesale Banking contributed $240 million of the
    Company s net income in 2009, or a decrease of
    $662 million (73.4 percent) compared with 2008. The
    decrease was primarily driven by higher provision for credit
    losses and noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net
    revenue.

Total net revenue increased $171 million (5.8 percent)
    in 2009, compared with 2008. Net interest income, on a

taxable-equivalent basis, increased $53 million
    (2.5 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008, driven by strong
    growth in deposits and improved spreads on loans, partially
    offset by the decline in the margin benefit of deposits in a
    declining interest rate environment. Noninterest income
    increased $118 million (13.7 percent) in 2009,
    compared with 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher
    treasury management, letters of credit, commercial loan, and
    capital markets fees, partially offset by declining valuations
    on equity investments.

Total noninterest expense increased $56 million
    (5.3 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008, primarily due to
    higher FDIC deposit insurance expense. The provision for credit
    losses increased $1.2 billion in 2009, compared with 2008.
    The unfavorable change was primarily due to an increase in net
    charge-offs and deterioration in the credit quality of
    commercial and commercial real estate loans. Nonperforming
    assets were $2.6 billion at December 31, 2009,
    compared with $1.3 billion at December 31, 2008.
    Nonperforming assets as a percentage of period-end loans were
    4.42 percent at December 31, 2009, compared with
    1.95 percent at December 31, 2008. Refer to the
     Corporate Risk Profile  section for further
    information on factors impacting the credit quality of the loan
    portfolios.

Consumer
    Banking     Consumer
    Banking delivers products and services through banking offices,
    telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail and
    ATM processing. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan
    banking, in-store banking, small business banking, consumer
    lending, mortgage banking, consumer finance, workplace banking,
    student banking and
     24-hour 
    banking. Consumer Banking contributed $917 million of the
    Company s net income in 2009, or an increase of
    $74 million (8.8 percent), compared with 2008. Within
    Consumer Banking, the retail banking division contributed
    $359 million of the total net income in 2009, or a decrease
    of $392 million (52.2 percent) from the prior year.
    Mortgage banking contributed $558 million of the business
    line s net income in 2009, or an increase of
    $466 million over the prior year, reflecting strong
    mortgage loan production and improved loan sale profitability.

Total net revenue increased $1.0 billion
    (16.9 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008. Net interest
    income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased
    $151 million (3.9 percent) in 2009, compared with
    2008. The
     year-over-year 
    increase in net interest income was due to increases in average
    loan and deposit balances, partially offset by the decline in
    the margin benefit of deposits in a declining interest rate
    environment. The increase in average loan balances reflected
    core growth in most loan categories, with the largest increases
    in retail loans and residential mortgages. In addition, average
    loan balances increased due to the Downey and PFF acquisitions
    in the fourth quarter of 2008, reflected primarily in covered
    assets. The favorable change in retail loans was principally
    driven by increases in home equity and federally guaranteed
    student loan balances. The
     year-over-year 
    increase in average deposits reflected core increases, primarily
    within savings and time deposits. In addition, average deposit
    balances increased due to the Downey and PFF acquisitions in the
    fourth quarter of 2008. Fee-based noninterest income increased
    $860 million (41.3 percent) in 2009, compared with
    2008. The
     year-over-year 
    increase in fee-based revenue was driven by higher mortgage
    banking revenue due to strong mortgage loan production and
    improved loan sale profitability, an improvement in retail lease
    residual losses, and higher ATM processing services fees,
    partially offset by lower deposit service charges.

Total noninterest expense increased $440 million
    (13.6 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008. The increase
    reflected higher FDIC deposit insurance expense, mortgage and
    ATM volume-related expenses, and higher credit related costs
    associated with OREO and foreclosures.

The provision for credit losses increased $456 million
    (31.9 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008. The increase
    was due to growth in net charge-offs and stress in residential
    mortgages, home equity and other installment and consumer loan
    portfolios from a year ago. As a percentage of average loans
    outstanding, net charge-offs increased to 1.50 percent in
    2009, compared with .95 percent in 2008. Commercial and
    commercial real estate loan net charge-offs increased
    $125 million and retail loan and residential mortgage net
    charge-offs increased $519 million in 2009, compared with
    2008. Nonperforming assets were $1.3 billion at
    December 31, 2009, compared with $1.2 billion at
    December 31, 2008. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of
    period-end loans were 1.36 percent at December 31,
    2009, compared with 1.24 percent at December 31, 2008.

    Services contributed $373 million of the Company s net
    income in 2009, a decrease of $111 million
    (22.9 percent), compared with 2008.

Total net revenue decreased $198 million
    (11.2 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008. Net interest
    income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased
    $83 million (18.7 percent) in 2009, compared with
    2008. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to
    the reduction in the margin benefit from deposits, partially
    offset by higher deposit volumes. Noninterest income decreased
    $115 million (8.7 percent) in 2009, compared with
    2008, reflecting lower assets under management account volume
    and the impact of low interest rates on money market investment
    fees.

Total noninterest expense decreased $51 million
    (5.1 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008. The decrease in
    noninterest expense was primarily due to lower compensation and
    employee benefits expense, litigation-related costs and other
    intangibles expense, partially offset by higher FDIC deposit
    insurance expense.

are highly inter-related with banking products and services of
    the other lines of business and rely on access to the bank
    subsidiary s settlement network, lower cost funding
    available to the Company, cross-selling opportunities and
    operating efficiencies. Payment Services contributed
    $291 million of the Company s net income in 2009, or a
    decrease of $457 million (61.1 percent) compared with
    2008. The decrease was primarily due to a higher provision for
    credit losses.

Total net revenue increased $222 million (5.6 percent)
    in 2009, compared with 2008. Net interest income, on a
    taxable-equivalent basis, increased $155 million
    (15.2 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008, primarily due
    to growth in credit card loan balances, partially offset by the
    cost of rebates on the government card program. Noninterest
    income increased $67 million (2.3 percent) in 2009,
    compared with 2008, driven by higher credit and debit card fees
    and a contract termination fee.

Total noninterest expense increased $139 million
    (8.9 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008, due to marketing
    and business development expense related to the introduction of
    new credit card products.

The provision for credit losses increased $800 million
    (67.7 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008, due to higher
    net charge-offs, retail credit card portfolio growth, higher
    delinquency rates and deteriorating economic conditions during
    most of the year. As a percentage of average loans outstanding,
    net charge-offs were 6.16 percent in 2009, compared with
    3.94 percent in 2008.

Treasury and
    Corporate Support
        Treasury and
    Corporate Support includes the Company s investment
    portfolios, funding, recently acquired assets and assumed
    liabilities prior to assignment to business lines, capital
    management, asset securitization, interest rate risk management,
    the net effect of transfer pricing related to average balances
    and the residual aggregate of expenses associated with corporate
    activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury
    and Corporate Support recorded net income of $384 million
    in 2009, compared with a net loss of $31 million in 2008.

Total net revenue increased $785 million in 2009, compared
    with 2008. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis,
    increased $574 million in 2009, compared with 2008,
    reflecting the impact of the declining interest rate
    environment, wholesale funding decisions and the Company s
    asset/liability position. Noninterest income increased
    $211 million (54.2 percent) in 2009, compared with
    2008. The increase was primarily due to lower impairment charges
    on structured investment related securities, a gain on a
    corporate real estate transaction and higher gains on the sale
    of investment securities in 2009, partially offset by the net
    impact of the 2008 gains related to the Company s ownership
    position in Visa Inc. and impairments on preferred securities
    and non-agency mortgage-backed securities in 2009.

Total noninterest expense increased $349 million
    (69.2 percent) in 2009, compared with 2008. The increase in
    noninterest expense was driven by a 2009 FDIC special
    assessment, increased litigation, higher costs related to
    affordable housing and other tax advantaged projects, the impact
    of the FBOP acquisition, and higher acquisition integration
    costs.

Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a
    managerial tax rate of 36.4 percent with the residual tax
    expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax
    rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support. The
    consolidated effective tax rate of the Company was
    15.0 percent in 2009, compared with 26.5 percent in
    2008. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2008 reflected
    the impact of the relative level of tax-exempt income, and
    investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged
    projects, combined with lower pre-tax earnings
     year-over-year. 

Non-Regulatory
    Capital Ratios  

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the
    Company considers other ratios when evaluating capital
    utilization and adequacy, including:

Tangible common equity to tangible assets,

Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets, and

Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets.

These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as
    useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital
    available to withstand unexpected market conditions.
    Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to
    compare the Company s capitalization to other financial
    services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios
    defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator
    excludes shareholders  equity associated with preferred
    securities, the nature and extent of which varies among
    different financial services companies. These ratios are not
    determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principals ( GAAP ) and are not defined in federal
    banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital
    ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP
    financial measures.

U.S. BANCORP   61 

Despite the importance of these non-regulatory capital ratios to
    the Company, there are no standardized definitions for them,
    and, as a result, the Company s calculation methods may
    differ from those used by other financial services companies.
    Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to
    investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to
    consider the consolidated financial statements and other
    financial information contained in this report in their
    entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.

The following table shows the Company s calculation of the
    non-regulatory capital ratios:

Accounting
    Changes  

Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    discusses accounting standards adopted in 2009, as well as
    accounting standards recently issued but not yet required to be
    adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting
    standards. To the extent the adoption of new accounting
    standards affects the Company s financial condition or
    results of operations, the impacts are discussed in the
    applicable section(s) of the Management s Discussion and
    Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies  

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    and conform to general practices within the banking industry.
    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions. The Company s financial
    position and results of operations can be affected by these
    estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding
    the Company s financial statements. Critical accounting
    policies are those policies management believes are the most
    important to the portrayal of the Company s financial
    condition and results, and require management to make estimates
    that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting
    policies are not considered by management to be critical
    accounting policies. Several factors are considered in
    determining whether or not a policy is critical in the
    preparation of financial statements. These factors include,
    among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the
    financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability
    to readily validate the estimates with other information
    including third-parties sources or available prices, and
    sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions
    and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under
    generally

62     U.S. BANCORP

accepted accounting principles. Management has discussed the
    development and the selection of critical accounting policies
    with the Company s Audit Committee.

Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those policies
    considered to be critical accounting policies are described
    below.

    allowance for credit losses is established to provide for
    probable losses incurred in the Company s credit portfolio.
    The methods utilized to estimate the allowance for credit
    losses, key assumptions and quantitative and qualitative
    information considered by management in determining the adequacy
    of the allowance for credit losses are discussed in the
     Credit Risk Management  section.

Management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance
    for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting
    estimates for a banking institution. It is an inherently
    subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed
    throughout the Management s Discussion and Analysis section
    of the Annual Report. Although risk management practices,
    methodologies and other tools are utilized to determine each
    element of the allowance, degrees of imprecision exist in these
    measurement tools due in part to subjective judgments involved
    and an inherent lagging of credit quality measurements relative
    to the stage of the business cycle. Even determining the stage
    of the business cycle is highly subjective. As discussed in the
     Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit
    Losses  section, management considers the effect of
    imprecision and many other factors in determining the allowance
    for credit losses. If not considered, incurred losses in the
    portfolio related to imprecision and other subjective factors
    could have a dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and
    financial viability of a bank.

Given the many subjective factors affecting the credit
    portfolio, changes in the allowance for credit losses may not
    directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the credit
    portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is in part
    due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation to
    changes in the business cycle, the exposure and mix of loans
    within risk rating categories, levels of nonperforming loans and
    the timing of charge-offs and recoveries. For example, the
    amount of loans within specific risk ratings may change,
    providing a leading indicator of improving credit quality, while
    nonperforming loans and net charge-offs continue at elevated
    levels. Also, inherent loss ratios, determined through migration
    analysis and historical loss performance over the estimated
    business cycle of a loan, may not change to the same degree as
    net charge-offs. Because risk ratings and inherent loss ratios
    primarily drive the allowance specifically allocated to
    commercial loans, the amount of the allowance for commercial and
    commercial real estate loans might decline; however, the degree
    of change differs somewhat from the level of changes in
    nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Also, management would
    maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses by increasing
    the allowance during periods of economic uncertainty or changes
    in the business cycle.

Some factors considered in determining the adequacy of the
    allowance for credit losses are quantifiable while other factors
    require qualitative judgment. Management conducts an analysis
    with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility
    of inherent losses, and utilizes this analysis along with
    qualitative factors, including uncertainty in the economy from
    changes in unemployment rates, the level of bankruptcies and
    concentration risks, including risks associated with the
    weakened housing market and highly leveraged enterprise-value
    credits, in determining the overall level of the allowance for
    credit losses. The Company s determination of the allowance
    for commercial and commercial real estate loans is sensitive to
    the assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates at
    December 31, 2009. In the event that 10 percent of
    loans within these portfolios experienced downgrades of two risk
    categories, the allowance for commercial and commercial real
    estate would increase by approximately $331 million at
    December 31, 2009. In the event that inherent loss or
    estimated loss rates for these portfolios increased by
    10 percent, the allowance determined for commercial and
    commercial real estate would increase by approximately
    $153 million at December 31, 2009. The Company s
    determination of the allowance for residential and retail loans
    is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates. In the event
    that estimated loss rates increased by 10 percent, the
    allowance for residential mortgages and retail loans would
    increase by approximately $250 million at December 31,
    2009. Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are
    considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, these
    sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and
    extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses.
    They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse
    changes in risk rating and inherent losses and do not imply any
    expectation of future deterioration in the risk rating or loss
    rates. Given current processes employed by the Company,
    management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates
    currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible

U.S. BANCORP   63 

that others, given the same information, may at any point in
    time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be
    significant to the Company s financial statements. Refer to
    the  Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit
    Losses  section for further information.

Fair Value
    Estimates     A portion
    of the Company s assets and liabilities are carried at fair
    value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in fair
    value recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive
    income (loss) in accordance with applicable accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. These
    include all of the Company s
     available-for-sale 
    securities, derivatives and other trading instruments, MSRs and
    certain mortgage loans
     held-for-sale. 
    The estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for
    sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. The
    determination of fair value is important for certain other
    assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair
    value estimates, including goodwill and other intangible assets,
    assets acquired in business combinations, impaired loans, OREO
    and other repossessed assets.

Fair value is generally defined as the exit price at which an
    asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction
    between willing, unrelated parties, other than in a forced or
    liquidation sale. Fair value is based on quoted market prices in
    an active market, or if market prices are not available, is
    estimated using models employing techniques such as matrix
    pricing or discounting expected cash flows. The significant
    assumptions used in the models, which include assumptions for
    interest rates, discount rates, prepayments and credit losses,
    are independently verified against observable market data where
    possible. Where observable market data is not available, the
    estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a
    high degree of judgment. In this circumstance, fair value is
    estimated based on management s judgment regarding the
    value that market participants would assign to the asset or
    liability. This valuation process takes into consideration
    factors such as market illiquidity. Imprecision in estimating
    these factors can impact the amount recorded on the balance
    sheet for a particular asset or liability with related impacts
    to earnings or other comprehensive income (loss).

When available, trading and
     available-for-sale 
    securities are valued based on quoted market prices. However,
    certain securities are traded less actively and therefore, may
    not be able to be valued based on quoted market prices. The
    determination of fair value may require benchmarking to similar
    instruments or performing a discounted cash flow analysis using
    estimates of future cash flows and prepayment, interest and
    default rates. An example is interests held in entities
    collateralized by mortgage
     and/or  debt
    obligations as part of a structured investment. For more
    information on investment securities, refer to Note 5 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As few derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, the
    majority of the Company s derivative positions are valued
    using valuation techniques that use readily observable market
    parameters. Certain derivatives, however, must be valued using
    techniques that include unobservable parameters. For these
    instruments, the significant assumptions must be estimated and
    therefore, are subject to judgment. These instruments are
    normally traded less actively. An example includes certain
    long-dated interest rate swaps. Note 20 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of the
    Company s derivative positions.

Refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information regarding estimations of
    fair value.

Purchased
    Loans and Related Indemnification Assets
        In accordance with
    applicable authoritative accounting guidance effective for the
    Company beginning January 1, 2009, all purchased loans and
    related indemnification assets are recorded at fair value at
    date of purchase. The initial valuation of these loans and the
    related indemnification assets requires management to make
    subjective judgments concerning estimates about how the acquired
    loans will perform in the future using valuation methods
    including discounted cash flow analysis and independent
    third-party appraisals. Factors that may significantly affect
    the initial valuation include, among others, market-based and
    industry data related to expected changes in interest rates,
    assumptions related to probability and severity of credit
    losses, estimated timing of credit losses including the
    foreclosure and liquidation of collateral, expected prepayment
    rates, required or anticipated loan modifications, unfunded loan
    commitments, the specific terms and provisions of any loss
    sharing agreements, and specific industry and market conditions
    that may impact discount rates and independent third-party
    appraisals.

On an ongoing basis, the accounting for purchased loans and
    related indemnification assets follows applicable authoritative
    accounting guidance for purchased non-impaired loans and
    purchased impaired loans. Refer to Note 1 and Note 6
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    information. In addition, refer to

64     U.S. BANCORP

the  Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit
    Losses  section for information on the determination of the
    required allowance for credit losses, if any, for these loans.

Mortgage
    Servicing Rights
        MSRs are capitalized
    as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained
    or may be purchased from others. MSRs are initially recorded at
    fair value and remeasured at each subsequent reporting date.
    Because MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily
    observable prices, the Company determines the fair value by
    estimating the present value of the asset s future cash
    flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates,
    and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade
    information, industry surveys and independent third party
    appraisals. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recorded in
    earnings during the period in which they occur. Risks inherent
    in the MSRs valuation include higher than expected prepayment
    rates  and/or 
    delayed receipt of cash flows. The Company may utilize
    derivatives, including futures and options contracts, to
    mitigate the valuation risk. The estimated sensitivity to
    changes in interest rates of the fair value of the MSRs
    portfolio and the related derivative instruments at
    December 31, 2009, to an immediate 25 and 50 bps
    downward movement in interest rates would be a decrease of
    approximately $5 million and $15 million,
    respectively. An upward movement in interest rates at
    December 31, 2009, of 25 and 50 bps would increase the
    value of the MSRs and related derivative instruments by
    approximately $2 million and $1 million, respectively.
    Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information regarding MSRs.

Goodwill and
    Other Intangibles
        The Company records
    all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions,
    including goodwill and other intangibles, at fair value.
    Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are
    subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. In
    certain situations, interim impairment tests may be required if
    events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than
    not reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its
    carrying amount. Other intangible assets are amortized over
    their estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated
    methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances
    indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.

The initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets
    and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make
    subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired
    assets will perform in the future using valuation methods
    including discounted cash flow analysis. Additionally, estimated
    cash flows may extend beyond ten years and, by their nature, are
    difficult to determine over an extended timeframe. Events and
    factors that may significantly affect the estimates include,
    among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and
    attrition, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures,
    technology, changes in discount rates and specific industry and
    market conditions. In determining the reasonableness of cash
    flow estimates, the Company reviews historical performance of
    the underlying assets or similar assets in an effort to assess
    and validate assumptions utilized in its estimates.

In assessing the fair value of reporting units, the Company may
    consider the stage of the current business cycle and potential
    changes in market conditions in estimating the timing and extent
    of future cash flows. Also, management often utilizes other
    information to validate the reasonableness of its valuations
    including public market comparables, and multiples of recent
    mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Valuation
    multiples may be based on revenue,
     price-to-earnings 
    and tangible capital ratios of comparable public companies and
    business segments. These multiples may be adjusted to consider
    competitive differences, including size, operating leverage and
    other factors. The carrying amount of a reporting unit is
    determined based on the capital required to support the
    reporting unit s activities, including its tangible and
    intangible assets. The determination of a reporting unit s
    capital allocation requires management judgment and considers
    many factors, including the regulatory capital regulations and
    capital characteristics of comparable public companies in
    relevant industry sectors. In certain circumstances, management
    will engage a third-party to independently validate its
    assessment of the fair value of its reporting units.

The Company s annual assessment of potential goodwill
    impairment was completed during the second quarter of 2009.
    Based on the results of this assessment, no goodwill impairment
    was recognized. Because of current economic conditions the
    Company continues to monitor goodwill and other intangible
    assets for impairment indicators throughout the year.

Income Taxes
        The Company
    estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be
    owed to various tax jurisdictions. Currently, the Company files
    tax returns in approximately 286 federal, state and local
    domestic jurisdictions and 13 foreign jurisdictions. The
    estimated

U.S. BANCORP   65 

income tax expense is reported in the Consolidated Statement of
    Income. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to
    or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or
    in the future and are reported in other assets or other
    liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In estimating
    accrued taxes, the Company assesses the relative merits and
    risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory,
    judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax
    position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations,
    interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment
    given specific facts and circumstances. It is possible that
    others, given the same information, may at any point in time
    reach different reasonable conclusions regarding the estimated
    amounts of accrued taxes.

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due
    to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status
    of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities,
    and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance
    that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions.
    These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be
    significant to the operating results of the Company. Refer to
    Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information regarding income taxes.

Controls and
    Procedures  

Under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company s management, including its principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer, the Company has
    evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
     Rules 13a-15(e) 
    and
     15d-15(e) 
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange
    Act )). Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as
    of the end of the period covered by this report, the
    Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there was no
    change made in the Company s internal controls over
    financial reporting (as defined in
     Rules 13a-15(f) 
    and
     15d-15(f) 
    under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
    internal control over financial reporting.

The annual report of the Company s management on internal
    control over financial reporting is provided on page 67.
    The attestation report of Ernst   Young LLP, the
    Company s independent accountants, regarding the
    Company s internal control over financial reporting is
    provided on page 69.

66     U.S. BANCORP

Report
    of Management

Responsibility for the financial statements and other
    information presented throughout this Annual Report rests with
    the management of U.S. Bancorp. The Company believes that
    the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States and present the substance of transactions based on
    the circumstances and management s best estimates and
    judgment.

In meeting its responsibilities for the reliability of the
    financial statements, management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over
    financial reporting as defined by
     Rules 13a-15(f) 
    and
     15d-15(f) 
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company s
    system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of publicly filed financial statements in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States.

To test compliance, the Company carries out an extensive audit
    program. This program includes a review for compliance with
    written policies and procedures and a comprehensive review of
    the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal
    control. Although control procedures are designed and tested, it
    must be recognized that there are limits inherent in all systems
    of internal control and, therefore, errors and irregularities
    may nevertheless occur. Also, estimates and judgments are
    required to assess and balance the relative cost and expected
    benefits of the controls. Projection of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

The Board of Directors of the Company has an Audit Committee
    composed of directors who are independent of U.S. Bancorp.
    The committee meets periodically with management, the internal
    auditors and the independent accountants to consider audit
    results and to discuss internal accounting control, auditing and
    financial reporting matters.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s
    system of internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those
    criteria, management believes that the Company designed and
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2009.

The Company s independent accountants, Ernst  
    Young LLP, have been engaged to render an independent
    professional opinion on the financial statements and issue an
    attestation report on the Company s internal control over
    financial reporting. Their opinion on the financial statements
    appearing on page 68 and their attestation on internal
    control over financial reporting appearing on page 69 are
    based on procedures conducted in accordance with auditing
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States).

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    on the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of U.S. Bancorp:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    U.S. Bancorp as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, shareholders 
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of U.S. Bancorp s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of U.S. Bancorp at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations
    and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    U.S. Bancorp s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of U.S. Bancorp:

We have audited U.S. Bancorp s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    U.S. Bancorp s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of
    Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
    U.S. Bancorp s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, U.S. Bancorp maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria . 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Bancorp as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, shareholders  equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009 and our report dated February 26, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Note 1        Significant
    Accounting Policies 

U.S. Bancorp is a multi-state financial services holding
    company headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. U.S. Bancorp
    and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) provide a full
    range of financial services including lending and depository
    services through banking offices principally in 24 states.
    The Company also engages in credit card, merchant, and ATM
    processing, mortgage banking, insurance, trust and investment
    management, brokerage, and leasing activities principally in
    domestic markets.

Basis of
    Presentation     The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
    Company and its subsidiaries and all variable interest entities
    ( VIEs ) for which the Company is the primary
    beneficiary. Consolidation eliminates all significant
    intercompany accounts and transactions. Certain items in prior
    periods have been reclassified to conform to the current
    presentation.

Uses of
    Estimates     The
    preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
    accepted accounting principles requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
    the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
    experience could differ from those estimates.

Business
    Segments  

Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major
    lines of business based on the products and services provided to
    customers through its distribution channels. The Company has
    five reportable operating segments:

Wholesale
    Banking     Wholesale
    Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket
    leasing, depository, treasury management, capital markets,
    foreign exchange, international trade services and other
    financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial
    real estate, financial institution and public sector clients.

Consumer
    Banking     Consumer
    Banking delivers products and services through banking offices,
    telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail and
    ATM processing. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan
    banking, in-store banking, small business banking, consumer

    policies for the lines of business are the same as those used in
    preparation of the consolidated financial statements with
    respect to activities specifically attributable to each business
    line. However, the preparation of business line results requires
    management to allocate funding costs and benefits, expenses and
    other financial elements to each line of business. For details
    of these methodologies and segment results, see  Basis for
    Financial Presentation  and Table 22   Line of

    Statements.

Securities  

Realized gains or losses on securities are determined on a trade
    date basis based on the specific amortized cost of the
    investments sold.

Trading
    Securities     Debt and
    equity securities held for resale are classified as trading
    securities and reported at fair value. Realized gains or losses
    are reported in noninterest income.

Available-for-sale 
    Securities     These
    securities are not trading securities but may be sold before
    maturity in response to changes in the Company s interest
    rate risk profile, funding needs, demand for collateralized
    deposits by public entities or other reasons.
     Available-for-sale 
    securities are carried at fair value with unrealized net gains
    or losses reported within other comprehensive income (loss) in
    shareholders  equity. Declines in fair value related to
     other-than-temporary 
    losses, if any, are reported in noninterest income.

74     U.S. BANCORP

Held-to-maturity 
    Securities     Debt
    securities for which the Company has the positive intent and
    ability to hold to maturity are reported at historical cost
    adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
    discounts. Declines in fair value related to
     other-than-temporary 
    losses, if any, are reported in noninterest income.

Securities
    Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under
    Agreements to Repurchase
        Securities purchased
    under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements
    to repurchase are generally accounted for as collateralized
    financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which
    the securities were acquired or sold, plus accrued interest. The
    fair value of collateral received is continually monitored and
    additional collateral is obtained or requested to be returned to
    the Company as deemed appropriate.

Equity
    Investments in Operating Entities  

Equity investments in public entities in which the
    Company s ownership is less than 20 percent are
    accounted for as
     available-for-sale 
    securities and are carried at fair value. Similar investments in
    private entities are accounted for using the cost method.
    Investments in entities where the Company has a significant
    influence (generally between 20 percent and 50 percent
    ownership) but does not control the entity are accounted for
    using the equity method. Limited partnerships and limited
    liability companies where the Company s ownership interest
    is greater than 5 percent are accounted for using the
    equity method. All equity investments are evaluated for
    impairment at least annually and more frequently if certain
    criteria are met.

Loans  

The Company s accounting methods for loans differ depending
    on whether the loans are originated or purchased, and for
    purchased loans, whether the loans were acquired at a discount
    related to evidence of credit deterioration since date of
    origination.

Originated
    Loans Held for Investment
        Loans the Company
    originates are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net
    of unearned income, net deferred loan fees or costs, and any
    direct principal charge-offs. Interest income is accrued on the
    unpaid principal balances as earned. Loan and commitment fees
    and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and
    recognized over the life of the loan
     and/or 
    commitment period as yield adjustments.

Purchased
    Loans     All purchased
    loans (non-impaired and impaired) acquired on or after
    January 1, 2009 are initially measured at fair value as of
    the acquisition date in accordance with applicable authoritative
    accounting guidance. Credit discounts are included in the
    determination of fair value. An allowance for credit losses is
    not recorded at the acquisition date for loans purchased on or
    after January 1, 2009. In accordance with applicable
    authoritative accounting guidance, purchased non-impaired loans
    acquired prior to January 1, 2009 were generally recorded
    at the predecessor s carrying value including an allowance
    for credit losses.

In determining the acquisition date fair value of purchased
    impaired loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Company
    generally aggregates purchased consumer loans and certain
    smaller balance commercial loans into pools of loans with common
    risk characteristics, while accounting for larger balance
    commercial loans individually. Expected cash flows at the
    purchase date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded
    as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and
    amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable.
    Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash flows over
    those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest
    income prospectively. The present value of any decreases in
    expected cash flows after the purchase date is recognized by
    recording an allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans,
    including lines of credit and credit cards loans, and leases are
    excluded from purchased impaired loans accounting.

For purchased loans acquired on or after January 1, 2009
    that are not deemed impaired at acquisition, credit discounts
    representing the principal losses expected over the life of the
    loan are a component of the initial fair value. Subsequent to
    the purchase date, the methods utilized to estimate the required
    allowance for credit losses for these loans is similar to
    originated loans, however, the Company records a provision for
    loan losses only when the required allowance, net of any
    expected reimbursement under any loss sharing agreements with
    the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ),
    exceeds any remaining credit discounts. The remaining
    differences between the purchase price and the unpaid principal
    balance at the date of acquisition are recorded in interest
    income over the life of the loans.

Covered Assets
        Loans and foreclosed
    real estate covered under loss sharing or similar credit
    protection agreements with the FDIC are reported in loans along
    with the related indemnification asset. In accordance with
    applicable authoritative accounting guidance effective for the

U.S. BANCORP   75 

Company beginning January 1, 2009, all purchased loans and
    related indemnification assets are recorded at fair value at
    date of purchase. Credit losses on these assets are determined
    net of the expected reimbursement from the FDIC.

Commitments to
    Extend Credit
        Unfunded residential
    mortgage loan commitments entered into in connection with
    mortgage banking activities are considered derivatives and
    recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair
    value recorded in income. All other unfunded loan commitments
    are generally related to providing credit facilities to
    customers of the Company and are not considered derivatives. For
    loans purchased on or after January 1, 2009, the fair value
    of the unfunded credit commitments is considered in the
    determination of the fair value of the loans recorded at the
    date of acquisition. Reserves for credit exposure on all other
    unfunded credit commitments are recorded in other liabilities.

Allowance for
    Credit Losses
        Management
    determines the adequacy of the allowance based on evaluations of
    credit relationships, the loan portfolio, recent loss
    experience, and other pertinent factors, including economic
    conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it
    requires estimates, including amounts of future cash collections
    expected on nonaccrual loans, which may be susceptible to
    significant change. The allowance for credit losses relating to
    originated loans that have become impaired is based on expected
    cash flows discounted using the original effective interest
    rate, the observable market price, or the fair value of the
    collateral for certain collateral-dependent loans. To the extent
    credit deterioration occurs on purchased loans after the date of
    acquisition, the Company records an allowance for credit losses,
    net of any expected reimbursement under any loss sharing
    agreements with the FDIC.

The Company determines the amount of the allowance required for
    certain sectors based on relative risk characteristics of the
    loan portfolio. The allowance recorded for commercial loans is
    based on quarterly reviews of individual credit relationships
    and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual
    loss experience. The allowance recorded for homogeneous consumer
    loans is based on an analysis of product mix, risk
    characteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy experiences, and
    historical losses, adjusted for current trends, for each
    homogenous category or group of loans. The allowance is
    increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and
    reduced by net charge-offs.

The Company also assesses the credit risk associated with
    off-balance sheet loan commitments, letters of credit, and
    derivatives. Credit risk associated with derivatives is
    reflected in the fair values recorded for those positions. The
    liability for off-balance sheet credit exposure related to loan
    commitments and other credit guarantees is included in other
    liabilities.

Nonaccrual
    Loans     Generally,
    commercial loans (including impaired loans) are placed on
    nonaccrual status when the collection of interest or principal
    has become 90 days past due or is otherwise considered
    doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid
    accrued interest is reversed. Future interest payments are
    generally applied against principal. Revolving consumer lines
    and credit cards are charged off when six months past due and
    closed-end consumer loans other than loans secured by 1-4 family
    properties are charged off at 120 days past due and are,
    therefore, generally not placed on nonaccrual status. Certain
    retail customers having financial difficulties may have the
    terms of their credit card and other loan agreements modified to
    require only principal payments and, as such, are reported as
    nonaccrual.

Generally, purchased impaired loans are considered accruing
    loans. However, the timing and amount of future cash flows for
    some loans is not reasonably estimable. Those loans are
    classified as nonaccrual loans and interest income is not
    recognized until the timing and amount of the future cash flows
    can be reasonably estimated.

Impaired Loans
        A loan is considered
    to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it
    is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts
    due (both interest and principal) according to the contractual
    terms of the loan agreement.

Impaired loans include certain nonaccrual commercial loans and
    loans for which a charge-off has been recorded based upon the
    fair value of the underlying collateral. Impaired loans also
    include loans that have been modified in troubled debt
    restructurings as a concession to borrowers experiencing
    financial difficulties. Purchased credit impaired loans are not
    reported as impaired loans as long as they continue to perform
    at least as well as expected at acquisition.

Restructured
    Loans     In cases where
    a borrower experiences financial difficulties and the Company
    makes certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms,
    the loan is classified as a restructured loan. Modifications may
    include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, forbearance and
    other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to
    avoid

76     U.S. BANCORP

foreclosure or repossession of collateral. For credit card loan
    agreements, such modifications may include canceling the
    customer s available line of credit on the credit card,
    reducing the interest rate on the card, and placing the customer
    on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. The
    allowance for credit losses on restructured loans is determined
    by discounting the restructured cash flows by the original
    effective rate. Loans restructured at a rate equal to or greater
    than that of a new loan with comparable risk at the time the
    loan agreement is modified may be excluded from restructured
    loan disclosures in years subsequent to the restructuring if
    they are in compliance with the modified terms.

Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is restructured remains on
    nonaccrual for a period of six months to demonstrate the
    borrower can meet the restructured terms. However, performance
    prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide
    with the restructuring, are considered in assessing whether the
    borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan being
    returned to accrual status at the time of restructuring or after
    a shorter performance period. If the borrower s ability to
    meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured, the
    loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan.

Leases
        The Company s
    lease portfolio consists of both direct financing and leveraged
    leases. The net investment in direct financing leases is the sum
    of all minimum lease payments and estimated residual values,
    less unearned income. Unearned income is recorded in interest
    income over the terms of the leases to produce a level yield.

The investment in leveraged leases is the sum of all lease
    payments (less nonrecourse debt payments) plus estimated
    residual values, less unearned income. Income from leveraged
    leases is recognized over the term of the leases based on the
    unrecovered equity investment.

Residual values on leased assets are reviewed regularly for
     other-than-temporary 
    impairment. Residual valuations for retail automobile leases are
    based on independent assessments of expected used car sale
    prices at the
     end-of-term. 
    Impairment tests are conducted based on these valuations
    considering the probability of the lessee returning the asset to
    the Company, re-marketing efforts, insurance coverage and
    ancillary fees and costs. Valuations for commercial leases are
    based upon external or internal management appraisals. When
    there is impairment of the Company s interest in the
    residual value of a leased asset, the carrying value is reduced
    to the estimated fair value with the writedown recognized in the
    current period.

Other Real
    Estate     Other real
    estate ( OREO ), which is included in other assets, is
    property acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings on
    defaulted loans. OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less
    estimated selling costs. OREO is evaluated regularly and any
    decreases in value are reported in noninterest expense.

Loans Held for
    Sale  

Loans held for sale ( LHFS ) represent mortgage loan
    originations intended to be sold in the secondary market and
    other loans that management has an active plan to sell. LHFS may
    be carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined on
    an aggregate basis by type of loan or carried at fair value
    where the Company has elected fair value accounting. The credit
    component of any writedowns upon transfer of loans to LHFS is
    reflected in charge-offs.

Where an election is made to subsequently carry the LHFS at fair
    value, any further decreases or subsequent increases in fair
    value are recognized in noninterest income. Where an election is
    made to subsequently carry LHFS at lower of cost or fair value,
    any further decreases are recognized in noninterest income and
    increases in fair value are not recognized until the loans are
    sold.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments  

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into
    derivative transactions to manage its interest rate, prepayment,
    credit, price and foreign currency risk and to accommodate the
    business requirements of its customers. Derivative instruments
    are reported in other assets or other liabilities at fair value.
    Changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized
    currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria
    are met.

All derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are
    recorded at fair value and classified either as a hedge of the
    fair value of a recognized asset or liability ( fair value
    hedge ) or as a hedge of the variability of cash flows to
    be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability
    or a forecasted transaction ( cash flow hedge ).
    Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly
    effective and designated as a fair value hedge, and the
    offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, are
    recorded in income. Effective changes in the fair value of a
    derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until cash flows
    of the hedged item are recognized in income. Any change in fair
    value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness is immediately
    recorded in noninterest income. The Company

U.S. BANCORP   77 

performs an assessment, both at the inception of a hedge and on
    a quarterly basis thereafter, to determine whether derivatives
    designated as hedging instruments are highly effective in
    offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items.

If a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or
    ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss in accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) is amortized to earnings over
    the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings.
    If a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, hedge
    accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is reported in
    earnings immediately.

Revenue
    Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue as it is earned based on
    contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are
    provided and collectibility is reasonably assured. In certain
    circumstances, noninterest income is reported net of associated
    expenses that are directly related to variable volume-based
    sales or revenue sharing arrangements or when the Company acts
    on an agency basis for others. Certain specific policies include
    the following:

Credit and
    Debit Card Revenue
        Credit and debit
    card revenue includes interchange income from credit and debit
    cards, annual fees, and other transaction and account management
    fees. Interchange income is a fee paid by a merchant bank to the
    card-issuing bank through the interchange network. Interchange
    fees are set by the credit card associations and are based on
    cardholder purchase volumes. The Company records interchange
    income as transactions occur. Transaction and account management
    fees are recognized as transactions occur or services are
    provided, except for annual fees, which are recognized over the
    applicable period. Volume-related payments to partners and
    credit card associations and expenses for rewards programs are
    also recorded within credit and debit card revenue. Payments to
    partners and expenses related to rewards programs are recorded
    when earned by the partner or customer.

Merchant
    Processing Services
        Merchant processing
    services revenue consists principally of transaction and account
    management fees charged to merchants for the electronic
    processing of transactions, net of interchange fees paid to the
    credit card issuing bank, card association assessments, and
    revenue sharing amounts, and is all recognized at the time the
    merchant s transactions are processed or other services are
    performed. The Company may enter into revenue sharing agreements
    with referral partners or in connection with purchases of
    merchant contracts from sellers. The revenue sharing amounts are
    determined primarily on sales volume processed or revenue
    generated for a particular group of merchants. Merchant
    processing revenue also includes revenues related to
     point-of-sale 
    equipment recorded as sales when the equipment is shipped or as
    earned for equipment rentals.

Trust and
    Investment Management Fees
        Trust and investment
    management fees are recognized over the period in which services
    are performed and are based on a percentage of the fair value of
    the assets under management or administration, fixed based on
    account type, or transaction-based fees.

Deposit
    Service Charges
        Service charges on
    deposit accounts are primarily monthly fees based on minimum
    balances or transaction-based fees. These fees are recognized as
    earned or as transactions occur and services are provided.

Other Significant
    Policies  

Intangible
    Assets    The price paid over the net fair value of
    acquired businesses ( goodwill ) is not amortized.
    Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated
    useful lives, using straight-line and accelerated methods. The
    recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets is
    evaluated annually, at a minimum, or on an interim basis if
    events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize
    the carrying amount. The evaluation includes assessing the
    estimated fair value of the intangible asset based on market
    prices for similar assets, where available, and the present
    value of the estimated future cash flows associated with the
    intangible asset.

Income Taxes
        Deferred taxes are
    recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of
    differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
    their financial reporting carrying amounts.

Mortgage
    Servicing Rights
        Mortgage servicing
    rights ( MSRs ) are capitalized as separate assets
    when loans are sold and servicing is retained or if they are
    purchased from others. MSRs are recorded at fair value. The
    Company determines the fair value by estimating the present
    value of the asset s future cash flows utilizing
    market-based prepayment rates, discount rates, and other
    assumptions validated through comparison to trade information,
    industry surveys and independent third party appraisals. Changes
    in the fair value of MSRs are recorded in earnings during the

78     U.S. BANCORP

period in which they occur. Risks inherent in the MSRs valuation
    include higher than expected prepayment rates
     and/or 
    delayed receipt of cash flows. The Company utilizes futures,
    forwards and options to mitigate MSR valuation risk. Fair value
    changes related to the MSRs and the futures, forwards and
    options, as well as servicing and other related fees, are
    recorded in mortgage banking revenue.

Pensions
        For purposes of its
    retirement plans, the Company utilizes its fiscal year-end as
    the measurement date. At the measurement date, plan assets are
    determined based on fair value, generally representing
    observable market prices. The actuarial cost method used to
    compute the pension liabilities and related expense is the
    projected unit credit method. The projected benefit obligation
    is principally determined based on the present value of
    projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate. The
    discount rate utilized is based on the investment yield of high
    quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace with
    maturities equal to projected cash flows of future benefit
    payments as of the measurement date. Periodic pension expense
    (or income) includes service costs, interest costs based on the
    assumed discount rate, the expected return on plan assets based
    on an actuarially derived market-related value and amortization
    of actuarial gains and losses. Pension accounting reflects the
    long-term nature of benefit obligations and the investment
    horizon of plan assets, and can have the effect of reducing
    earnings volatility related to short-term changes in interest
    rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include
    the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized gains and
    losses which are deferred and amortized over the future service
    periods of active employees. The market-related value utilized
    to determine the expected return on plan assets is based on fair
    value adjusted for the difference between expected returns and
    actual performance of plan assets. The unrealized difference
    between actual experience and expected returns is included in
    expense over a twelve-year period. The overfunded or underfunded
    status of the plans is recorded as an asset or liability on the
    balance sheet, with changes in that status recognized through
    other comprehensive income (loss).

Premises and
    Equipment     Premises
    and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
    and depreciated primarily on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated life of the assets. Estimated useful lives range up to
    40 years for newly constructed buildings and from 3 to
    20 years for furniture and equipment.

Capitalized leases, less accumulated amortization, are included
    in premises and equipment. Capitalized lease obligations are
    included in long-term debt. Capitalized leases are amortized on
    a straight-line basis over the lease term and the amortization
    is included in depreciation expense.

Stock-Based
    Compensation     The
    Company grants stock-based awards, including restricted stock,
    restricted stock units and options to purchase common stock of
    the Company. Stock option grants are for a fixed number of
    shares to employees and directors with an exercise price equal
    to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant.
    Stock-based compensation for awards is recognized in the
    Company s results of operations on a straight-line basis
    over the vesting period. The Company immediately recognizes
    compensation cost of awards to employees that meet retirement
    status, despite their continued active employment. The
    amortization of stock-based compensation reflects estimated
    forfeitures adjusted for actual forfeiture experience. As
    compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is
    recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction
    from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time
    stock-based awards are exercised, cancelled, expire, or
    restrictions are released, the Company may be required to
    recognize an adjustment to tax expense, depending on the market
    price of the Company s common stock at that time.

Per Share
    Calculations
        Earnings per common
    share is calculated by dividing net income applicable to
    U.S. Bancorp common shareholders by the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common
    share is calculated by adjusting income and outstanding shares,
    assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities.

Note 2        Accounting
    Changes 

Fair Value
    Measurements     On
    April 9, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    ( FASB ) issued new accounting guidance, which the
    Company adopted effective January 1, 2009, for determining
    fair value for an asset or liability if there has been a
    significant decrease in the volume and level of activity in
    relation to normal market activity. In that circumstance,
    transactions or quoted prices may not be determinative of fair
    value. Significant adjustments may be necessary to quoted prices
    or alternative valuation techniques may be required in order to
    determine the fair value of the asset or liability under current
    market conditions. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the
    use of valuation techniques other than quoted prices for the
    valuation of the Company s non-agency mortgage-backed

U.S. BANCORP   79 

securities, but the effect was not significant. For additional
    information on the fair value of certain financial assets and
    liabilities, refer to Note 21.

Other-Than-Temporary-Impairments 
        On April 9,
    2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance, which the Company
    adopted effective January 1, 2009, for the measurement and
    recognition of
     other-than-temporary 
    impairment for debt securities. If an entity does not intend to
    sell, and it is more likely than not that the entity will not be
    required to sell, a debt security before recovery of its cost
    basis,
     other-than-temporary 
    impairment should be separated into (a) the amount
    representing credit loss and (b) the amount related to all
    other factors. The amount of
     other-than-temporary 
    impairment related to credit loss is recognized in earnings and
     other-than-temporary 
    impairment related to other factors is recognized in other
    comprehensive income (loss). To determine the amount related to
    credit loss, the Company applies a methodology similar to that
    used for accounting by creditors for impairment of loans. The
    Company s adoption of this guidance resulted in the
    recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to increase
    January 1, 2009 retained earnings, with a corresponding
    adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), of
    $141 million. For additional information on investment
    securities, refer to Note 5.

Business
    Combinations
        Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted accounting guidance
    issued by the FASB which established principles and requirements
    for the acquirer in a business combination, including the
    recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets acquired,
    the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the
    acquired entity as of the acquisition date; the recognition and
    measurement of the goodwill acquired in the business combination
    or gain from a bargain purchase as of the acquisition date; and
    additional disclosures related to the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. Under this guidance, nearly
    all acquired assets and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair
    value at the acquisition date, including loans. The recognition
    at the acquisition date of an allowance for loan losses on
    acquired loans was eliminated, as credit-related factors are now
    incorporated directly into the fair value of the loans. Other
    significant changes include recognizing transaction costs and
    most restructuring costs as expenses when incurred. These
    accounting requirements are applied on a prospective basis for
    all transactions completed after the effective date.

Noncontrolling
    Interests     Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted accounting guidance
    issued by the FASB which changes the accounting and reporting
    for third-party ownership interests in the Company s
    consolidated subsidiaries. Under the new guidance, these
    interests are characterized as noncontrolling interests and
    classified as a component of equity, separate from
    U.S. Bancorp s own equity. In addition, the amount of
    net income attributable to the entity and to the noncontrolling
    interests is required to be shown separately on the consolidated
    statement of income. Upon adoption of this guidance, the Company
    reclassified $733 million in noncontrolling interests from
    other liabilities to equity and reclassified noncontrolling
    interests  share of net income from other noninterest
    expense to income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Accounting
    for Transfers of Financial Assets    In June 2009,
    the FASB issued accounting guidance, effective for the Company
    January 1, 2010, related to the transfer of financial
    assets. This guidance removes the exception for qualifying
    special-purpose entities from consolidation guidance and the
    exception for guaranteed mortgage securitizations when a
    transferor had not surrendered control over the transferred
    financial assets. In addition, the guidance provided
    clarification of the requirements for isolation and limitations
    on portions of financial assets that are eligible for sale
    accounting. The guidance also requires additional disclosure
    about transfers of financial assets and a transferor s
    continuing involvement with transferred assets. The Company
    expects the adoption of this guidance will not be significant to
    its financial statements.

Variable
    Interest Entities     In
    June 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance, effective for
    the Company on January 1, 2010, related to variable
    interest entities. This guidance replaces a quantitative-based
    risks and rewards calculation for determining which entity, if
    any, has both (a) a controlling financial interest in a
    variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying
    which entity has the power to direct the activities of a
    variable interest entity that most significantly impact the
    entity s economic performance and (b) the obligation
    to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits
    from the entity that could potentially be significant to the
    variable interest entity. This guidance requires reconsideration
    of whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any
    changes in facts or circumstances occur such that the holders of
    the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power to
    direct the activities of the entity that most significantly
    impact the entity s economic performance. It also requires
    ongoing assessments of whether a variable interest holder is the
    primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The

80     U.S. BANCORP

Company expects to consolidate approximately $1.6 billion
    of assets of previously unconsolidated entities, and to
    deconsolidate approximately $106 million of assets of
    previously consolidated entities upon adoption of this guidance.
    Additionally, the Company expects the adoption of this guidance
    will reduce shareholders  equity by $73 million.

Note 3        Business
    Combinations 

On October 30, 2009, the Company acquired the banking
    operations of First Bank of Oak Park Corporation
    ( FBOP ) in an FDIC assisted transaction. The Company
    acquired approximately $18.0 billion of assets and assumed
    approximately $17.4 billion of liabilities, including
    $15.4 billion of deposits. The Company entered into
    separate loss sharing agreements with the FDIC providing for
    specified credit loss protection for substantially all acquired
    loans, foreclosed real estate and selected investment
    securities. Under the terms of the loss sharing agreements, the
    FDIC will reimburse the Company for 80 percent of the first
    $3.5 billion of losses on those assets and 95 percent
    of losses beyond that amount. At the acquisition date, the
    Company estimated the FBOP assets would incur approximately
    $2.8 billion of losses, of which $1.9 billion would be
    reimbursable under the loss sharing agreements as losses are
    realized in future periods. The loss sharing agreements provide
    for coverage on losses for ten years on single family
    residential mortgages, and five years on commercial and other
    consumer assets. The Company recorded the acquired assets and
    liabilities at their estimated fair values at the acquisition
    date. The estimated fair value for loans reflected expected
    credit losses at the acquisition date and related reimbursement
    under the loss sharing agreements. As a result, the Company will
    only recognize a provision for credit losses and charge-offs on
    the acquired loans for any further credit deterioration, net of
    any expected reimbursement under the loss sharing agreements.

On November 21, 2008, the Company acquired the banking
    operations of Downey Savings   Loan Association, F.A.
    ( Downey ), and PFF Bank   Trust
    ( PFF ) from the FDIC. The Company acquired
    approximately $17.4 billion of assets and assumed
    approximately $15.8 billion of liabilities. In connection
    with these acquisitions, the Company entered into loss sharing
    agreements with the FDIC providing for specified credit loss and
    asset yield protection for all single family residential
    mortgages and credit loss protection for a significant portion
    of commercial and commercial real estate loans and foreclosed
    real estate. Under the terms of the loss sharing agreements, the
    Company will incur the first $1.6 billion of losses on
    those assets. The FDIC will reimburse the Company for
    80 percent of the next $3.1 billion of losses and
    95 percent of losses beyond that amount. At the acquisition
    date, the Company estimated the Downey and PFF assets would
    incur approximately $4.7 billion of losses, of which
    $2.4 billion would be reimbursable under the loss sharing
    agreements. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had
    received loss reimbursement of $144 million and estimated
    it will ultimately receive an additional $2.0 billion from
    the FDIC under the loss sharing agreements. At the acquisition
    date, the Company identified the acquired non-revolving loans
    experiencing credit deterioration, representing the majority of
    assets acquired, and recorded those assets at their estimated
    fair value, reflecting expected credit losses and the related
    reimbursement under loss sharing agreements. As a result, the
    Company only records provision for credit losses and charge-offs
    on these loans for any further credit deterioration after the
    date of acquisition. Based on the accounting guidance applicable
    in 2008, the Company recorded all other loans at the
    predecessors  carrying amount, net of fair value
    adjustments for any interest rate related discount or premium,
    and an allowance for credit losses.

Included in loans at December 31, 2009, were
    $22.5 billion of assets covered by loss sharing agreements
    with the FDIC ( covered assets ), compared with
    $11.5 billion at December 31, 2008.

Note 4        Restrictions
    on Cash and Due from Banks 

The Federal Reserve Bank requires bank subsidiaries to maintain
    minimum average reserve balances. The amount of those reserve
    balances were approximately $1.2 billion and
    $.9 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

In the fourth quarter of 2007 the Company purchased certain
    structured investment securities ( SIVs ) from certain
    money market funds managed by FAF Advisors, Inc., an affiliate
    of the Company. Subsequent to the initial purchase, the Company
    exchanged its interest in certain SIVs for a pro-rata portion of
    the underlying investment securities according to the applicable
    restructuring agreements. The SIVs and the investment securities
    received are collectively referred to as  SIV-related
    securities.  Some of these securities evidenced credit
    deterioration at the time of acquisition by the Company.

Changes in the amortized cost and accretable balance of the
    SIV-related securities and other investment securities that
    evidenced credit deterioration at the time of acquisition were
    as follows:

(a)

Represents
    the fair value of the securities at acquisition.   

(b)

Represents
    investment securities that did not evidence credit deterioration
    at acquisition date, received in exchange for SIVs or investment
    securities with changes in projected future cash
    flows.   

The Company conducts a regular assessment of its investment
    securities with unrealized losses to determine whether
    securities are
     other-than-temporarily 
    impaired considering, among other factors, the nature of the
    securities, credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer,
    the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, expected cash
    flows of underlying collateral, market conditions and whether
    the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not the
    Company will be required to sell the securities. To determine
    whether perpetual preferred securities are
     other-than-temporarily 
    impaired, the Company considers the issuers  credit
    ratings, historical financial performance and strength, the
    ability to sustain earnings, and other factors such as market
    presence and management experience.

    impairment by investment category:

(a)

Prime
    securities are those designated as such by the issuer or those

The Company determined the
     other-than-temporary 
    impairment recorded in earnings for securities other than
    perpetual preferred securities by estimating the future cash
    flows of each individual security, using market information
    where available, and discounting the cash flows at the original
    effective rate of the security.
     Other-than-temporary 
    impairment recorded in other comprehensive income was measured
    as the difference between that discounted amount and the fair
    value of each security. The following table includes the ranges

At December 31, 2009, certain investment securities had a
    fair value below amortized cost. The following table shows the
    gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company s
    investments with unrealized losses, aggregated by investment
    category and length of time the individual securities have been
    in continuous unrealized loss positions, at December 31,
    2009:

The Company does not consider these unrealized losses to be
    credit-related. These unrealized losses relate to changes in
    interest rates and market spreads subsequent to purchase. A
    substantial portion of securities that have unrealized losses
    are either corporate debt or non-agency mortgage-backed
    securities issued with high investment grade credit ratings. In
    general, the issuers of the investment securities are
    contractually prohibited from prepayment at less than par, and
    the Company did not pay significant purchase premiums for these
    securities. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no plans
    to sell securities with unrealized losses and believes it is
    more likely than not it would not be required to sell such
    securities before recovery of their amortized cost.

Note 6        Loans
    and Allowance for Credit Losses 

The composition of the loan portfolio at December 31 was as
    follows:

The Company had loans of $55.6 billion at December 31,
    2009, and $45.4 billion at December 31, 2008, pledged
    at the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ), and loans of
    $44.2 billion at December 31, 2009, and
    $47.2 billion at December 31, 2008, pledged at the
    Federal Reserve Bank.

The Company primarily lends to borrowers in the 24 states
    in which it has banking offices. Collateral for commercial loans
    may included marketable securities, accounts receivable,
    inventory and equipment. For details of the Company s
    commercial portfolio by industry group and geography as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, see Table 7 included in
    Management s Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated
    by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

For detail of the Company s commercial real estate
    portfolio by property type and geography as of December 31,
    2009, and 2008, see Table 8 included in Management s
    Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated by reference into
    these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Such loans are
    collateralized by the related property.

Originated loans are presented net of unearned interest and
    deferred fees and costs, which amounted to $1.3 billion and
    $1.5 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. In accordance with applicable authoritative
    accounting guidance effective for the Company January 1,
    2009, all purchased loans and related indemnification assets are
    recorded at fair value at the date of purchase. The Company
    evaluates purchased loans for impairment in accordance with
    applicable authoritative accounting guidance. Purchased loans
    with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for
    which it is probable that all contractually required payments
    will not be collected are considered impaired ( purchased
    impaired loans ). All other purchased loans are considered
    nonimpaired ( purchased nonimpaired loans ).

86     U.S. BANCORP

Covered assets represent assets acquired from the FDIC subject
    to loss sharing agreements and included expected reimbursements
    from the FDIC of approximately $3.9 billion at
    December 31, 2009, and $2.4 billion at
    December 31, 2008. The carrying amount of covered assets
    consisted of purchased impaired loans, purchased nonimpaired
    loans, and other assets as shown in the following table:

On the acquisition date, the preliminary estimate of the
    contractually required payments receivable for all purchased
    impaired loans acquired in the FBOP transaction, including those
    covered and not covered under loss sharing agreements with the
    FDIC, were $5.0 billion, the cash flows expected to be
    collected were $3.3 billion including interest, and the
    estimated fair values of the loans were $3.0 billion. These
    amounts were determined based upon the estimated remaining life
    of the underlying loans, which includes the effects of estimated
    prepayments. For the purchased nonimpaired loans acquired in the
    FBOP transaction, the preliminary estimate as of the acquisition
    date of the contractually required payments receivable were
    $12.7 billion, the contractual cash flows not expected to
    be collected were $2.8 billion, and the estimated fair
    value of the loans was $8.2 billion. Because of the short
    time period between the closing of the FBOP transaction and
    December 31, 2009, certain amounts related to purchased
    impaired and nonimpaired loans are preliminary estimates. The
    Company expects to finalize its analysis of these loans during
    the first six months of 2010 and, therefore, adjustments to the
    estimated amounts may occur.

At December 31, 2009, $1.1 billion of the purchased
    impaired loans acquired in the Downey, PFF and FBOP
    transactions, included in covered assets were classified as
    nonperforming assets, compared with $298 million at
    December 31, 2008, because the expected cash flows are
    primarily based on the liquidation of underlying collateral and
    the timing and amount of the cash flows could not be reasonably
    estimated. Interest income is recognized on other purchased
    impaired loans in covered assets through accretion of the
    difference between the carrying amount of those loans and their
    expected cash flows. The initial determination of the fair value
    of the purchased loans includes the impact of expected credit
    losses and therefore, no allowance for credit losses is recorded
    at the purchase date. To the extent credit deterioration occurs
    after the date of acquisition, the Company records an allowance
    for loan losses, net of expected reimbursement from the FDIC
    under the loss sharing agreements. There has not been any
    significant credit deterioration since the respective
    acquisition dates.

Changes in the accretable balance for purchased impaired loans
    for the Downey, PFF and FBOP transactions were as follows:

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, restructured
    loans not performing in accordance with modified terms, other
    real estate and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company.
    For details of the Company s

    credit discounts recorded as part of the initial determination
    of the fair value of purchased nonimpaired loans related to the
    FBOP transaction.   

A summary of impaired loans is as follows:

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company had net gains on the sale of loans of $710 million,
    $220 million and $163 million, respectively, which
    were included in noninterest income, primarily in mortgage
    banking revenue.

The Company has an equity interest in a joint venture that is
    accounted for utilizing the equity method. The principal
    activities of this entity are to develop land, and construct and
    sell residential homes.

The Company provides a warehousing line to this joint venture.
    Warehousing advances to the joint venture are repaid when the
    sale of loans is completed or the real estate is permanently
    refinanced by others. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company had $890 million and $894 million,
    respectively, of outstanding advances to this joint venture.

Note 8        Accounting
    for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Variable
    Interest Entities 

When the Company sells financial assets, it may retain servicing
    rights
     and/or  other
    beneficial interests in the transferred financial assets. The
    gain or loss on sale depends, in part, on the previous carrying
    amount of the transferred financial assets and the consideration
    other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets
    received in exchange. Upon transfer, any servicing assets are
    initially recognized at fair value. The remaining carrying
    amount of the transferred financial asset is allocated between
    the assets sold and any interests that continue to be held by
    the Company based on the relative fair values as of the date of
    transfer.

The Company is involved in various entities that are considered
    to be variable interest entities ( VIEs ) as defined
    by applicable authoritative accounting guidance. Generally, a
    VIE is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal
    structure that does not have equity investors with substantive
    voting rights or has equity investors that do not have
    sufficient equity at risk for the entity to independently
    finance its activities. The Company s investments in VIEs
    primarily represent private investment funds or partnerships
    that make equity investments, provide debt financing or support
    community-based investments in affordable housing, development
    entities that provide capital for communities located in
    low-income districts and for historic rehabilitation projects
    that may enable the Company to ensure regulatory compliance with
    the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the Company
    sponsors entities to which it transfers a pool of tax credit
    investments. These entities are consolidated by the Company as
    it continues to absorb the majority of the entities 
    expected losses. The Company expects to consolidate additional
    entities and deconsolidate other entities beginning in 2010 as a
    result of a change in accounting rules for VIEs.

U.S. BANCORP   89 

The Company sponsors an off-balance sheet conduit to which it
    transferred high-grade investment securities in prior years,
    initially funded by the conduit s issuance of commercial
    paper. The conduit held assets of $.6 billion at
    December 31, 2009, compared with $.8 billion at
    December 31, 2008. During 2008, the conduit ceased issuing
    commercial paper and began to draw upon a Company-provided
    liquidity facility to replace outstanding commercial paper as it
    matured. At December 31, 2009, the amount advanced to the
    conduit under the liquidity facility was $.7 billion,
    compared with $.9 billion at December 31, 2008, and
    was recorded on the Company s balance sheet in commercial
    loans. Under accounting rules applicable through 2009, the
    Company considered the conduit to be a VIE. The Company was not
    the primary beneficiary of the conduit as it did not absorb the
    majority of the variability of the conduit s cash flows or
    fair value. The Company will consolidate the conduit beginning
    in 2010 as a result of a change in the accounting rules related
    to VIEs.

The Company consolidates VIEs in which it is the primary
    beneficiary. At December 31, 2009, approximately
    $510 million of total assets related to various VIEs were
    consolidated by the Company in its financial statements,
    compared with $479 million at December 31, 2008.
    Creditors of these VIEs have no recourse to the general credit
    of the Company. The Company is not required to consolidate other
    VIEs as it is not the primary beneficiary. In such cases, the
    Company does not absorb the majority of the entities 
    expected losses nor does it receive a majority of the
    entities  expected residual returns. The Company s
    investments in unconsolidated VIEs, other than the off-balance
    sheet conduit, ranged from less than $1 million to
    $63 million, with an aggregate amount of approximately
    $2.4 billion at December 31, 2009, and from less than
    $1 million to $55 million, with an aggregate amount of
    $2.1 billion at December 31, 2008. While the Company
    believes potential losses from these investments is remote, the
    Company s maximum exposure to these unconsolidated VIEs,
    including any tax implications, was approximately
    $4.7 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with
    $3.9 billion at December 31, 2008, if all of the
    separate investments within the individual private funds were to
    become worthless and the community-based business and housing
    projects, and related tax credits completely failed and did not
    meet certain government compliance requirements.

Note 10        Mortgage
    Servicing Rights 

The Company serviced $150.8 billion of residential mortgage
    loans for others at December 31, 2009, and
    $120.3 billion at December 31, 2008. The net impact
    included in mortgage banking revenue of assumption changes on
    the fair value of MSRs and fair value changes of derivatives
    used to offset MSR value changes was a net gain of
    $147 million, for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared with net losses of $122 million and
    $35 million the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Loan servicing fees, not including valuation
    changes included in mortgage banking revenue, were
    $512 million, $404 million and $353 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Changes in fair value of capitalized MSRs are summarized as
    follows:

(a) Principally
    reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed
    assumptions, primarily arising from interest rate
    changes.  

(b) Primarily
    represents changes due to collection/realization of expected
    cash flows over time (decay).  

The estimated sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the
    fair value of the MSRs portfolio and the related derivative
    instruments at December 31, 2009, was as follows:

The fair value of MSRs and their sensitivity to changes in
    interest rates is influenced by the mix of the servicing
    portfolio and characteristics of each segment of the portfolio.
    The Company s servicing portfolio consists of the distinct
    portfolios of government-insured mortgages, conventional
    mortgages and Mortgage Revenue Bond Programs ( MRBP ).
    The servicing portfolios are predominantly comprised of
    fixed-rate agency loans with limited adjustable-rate or jumbo
    mortgage loans. The MRBP division specializes in servicing loans
    made under state and local housing authority programs. These
    programs provide mortgages to low-income and moderate-income
    borrowers and are generally government-insured programs with a
    favorable rate subsidy, down payment
     and/or 
    closing cost assistance. Mortgage loans originated as part of
    government agency and state loans programs tend to experience
    slower prepayment rates and better cash flows than conventional
    mortgage loans.

A summary of the Company s MSRs and related characteristics
    by portfolio as of December 31 was as follows:

(a) Value is
    calculated as fair market value divided by the servicing
    portfolio.

Note 13        Long-Term
    Debt 

Long-term debt (debt with original maturities of more than one
    year) at December 31 consisted of the following:

(a)

Weighted-average
    interest rates of medium-term notes, Federal Home Loan Bank
    advances and bank notes were 1.87 percent,
    1.84 percent and 2.94 percent, respectively.   

(b)

Other
    includes debt issuance fees and unrealized gains and losses and
    deferred amounts relating to derivative instruments.   

Convertible senior debentures issued by the Company pay interest
    on a quarterly basis until a specified period of time (five or
    nine years prior to the applicable maturity date). After this
    date, the Company will not pay interest on the debentures prior
    to maturity. On the maturity date or on any earlier redemption
    date, the holder will receive the original principal plus
    accrued interest. The debentures are convertible at any time on
    or prior to the maturity date. If the convertible senior
    debentures are converted, holders of the debentures will
    generally receive cash up to the accreted principal amount of
    the debentures plus, if the market price of the Company s
    common stock exceeds the conversion price in effect on the date
    of conversion, a number of shares of the Company s common
    stock, or an equivalent amount of cash at the Company s
    option, as determined in accordance with specified terms. The
    convertible senior debentures are callable by the Company and
    putable by the investors at a price equal to 100 percent of
    the accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
    During 2009, investors elected to put debentures with a
    principal amount of $54 million back to the Company. At
    December 31, 2009, the weighted average conversion price
    per share for all convertible issuances was $37.93.

During 2009, the Company issued $501 million of fixed-rate
    junior subordinated debentures to a separately formed
    wholly-owned trust for the purpose of issuing Company-obligated
    mandatorily redeemable preferred securities at an interest rate
    of 6.625 percent. Refer to Note 14,  Junior
    Subordinated Debentures  for further information on the
    nature and terms of these debentures. There were no such
    issuances in 2008. There were no redemptions of junior
    subordinated debentures in 2009 or 2008.

The Company has an arrangement with the Federal Home Loan Bank
    whereby the Company could have borrowed an additional
    $17.3 billion and $6.6 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, based on collateral available
    (residential and commercial mortgages).

Note 14        Junior
    Subordinated Debentures 

As of December 31, 2009, the Company sponsored, and wholly
    owned 100 percent of the common equity of, ten unconsolidated
    trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing
    Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities
    ( Trust Preferred Securities ) to third-party
    investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of the
    Trust Preferred Securities solely in junior subordinated
    debt securities of the Company (the  Debentures ). The
    Debentures held by the trusts, which totaled $4.6 billion,
    are the sole assets of each trust. The Company s
    obligations under the Debentures and related documents, taken
    together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the
    Company of the obligations of the trusts. The guarantee covers
    the distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of
    the Trust Preferred Securities, but only to the extent of
    funds held by the trusts. The Company has the right to redeem
    the Debentures in whole or in part, on or after specific dates,
    at a redemption price specified in the indentures plus any
    accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date. The Company
    used the proceeds from the sales of the Debentures for general
    corporate purposes.

In connection with the formation of USB Capital IX, the trust
    issued redeemable Income Trust Securities ( ITS )
    to third party investors, investing the proceeds in Debentures
    issued by the Company and entered into stock purchase contracts
    to purchase preferred stock to be issued by the Company in the
    future. Pursuant to the stock purchase contracts, the Company is
    required to make contract payments of .65 percent, also
    payable semi-annually, through a specified stock purchase date
    expected to be April 15, 2011. Prior to the specified stock
    purchase date, the trust is required to remarket and sell the
    Debentures to third party investors to generate cash proceeds to
    satisfy its obligation to purchase the Company s
    Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock
    ( Series A Preferred Stock ) pursuant to the
    stock purchase contracts. The Series A Preferred Stock,
    when issued pursuant to the stock purchase contracts, is
    expected to pay quarterly dividends equal to the greater of
    three-month LIBOR plus 1.02 percent or 3.50 percent.
    In connection with this transaction, the Company also entered
    into a replacement capital covenant which restricts the
    Company s rights to repurchase the ITS and to redeem or
    repurchase the Series A Preferred Stock.

The following table is a summary of the Debentures included in
    long-term debt as of December 31, 2009:

Note 15        Shareholders 
    Equity 

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had authority to
    issue 4 billion shares of common stock and 50 million
    shares of preferred stock. The Company had 1.9 billion and
    1.8 billion shares of common stock outstanding at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and had
    132 million shares reserved for future issuances, primarily
    under stock incentive plans and shares that may be issued in
    connection with the Company s convertible senior
    debentures, at December 31, 2009.

The number of shares issued and outstanding and the carrying
    amount of each outstanding series of the Company s
    preferred stock was as follows:

(a) The par
    value of all shares issued and outstanding at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, was $1.00 a share.  

On November 14, 2008, the Company issued 6.6 million
    shares of Series E Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual
    Preferred Stock (the  Series E Preferred Stock )
    and a warrant to purchase 33 million shares of the
    Company s common stock, at a price of $30.29 per common
    share, to the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the
    Capital Purchase Program of the Emergency Economic Stabilization
    Act of 2008 for proceeds of $6.6 billion. The Company
    allocated $172 million of the proceeds to the warrant, with
    the resulting discount on the Series E Preferred Stock
    being accreted over five years and reported as a reduction to
    income applicable to common equity over that period. On
    June 17, 2009, the Company redeemed the Series E
    Preferred Stock. The Company included in its computation of
    earnings per diluted common share for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 the impact of a deemed dividend of
    $154 million, representing the unaccreted preferred stock
    discount remaining on the redemption date. On July 15,
    2009, the Company repurchased the warrant from the
    U.S. Department of the Treasury for $139 million.

On March 27, 2006, the Company issued depositary shares
    representing an ownership interest in 40,000 shares of
    Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with a
    liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (the
     Series B Preferred Stock ), and on
    March 17, 2008, the Company issued depositary shares
    representing an ownership interest in 20,000 shares of
    Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with a
    liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (the
     Series D Preferred Stock ). The Series B
    Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock have no stated
    maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or other
    obligation of the Company. Dividends, if declared, will accrue
    and be payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate per annum equal
    to the greater of three-month LIBOR plus .60 percent, or
    3.50 percent on the Series B Preferred Stock, and
    7.875 percent per annum on the Series D Preferred
    Stock. Both series are redeemable at the Company s option,
    subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company repurchased shares of
    its common stock under various authorizations approved by its
    Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2009, the Company
    had approximately 20 million shares that may yet be
    purchased under the current Board of Directors approved
    authorization.

The following table summarizes the Company s common stock
    repurchased in each of the last three years:

Shareholders  equity is affected by transactions and
    valuations of asset and liability positions that require
    adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
    The reconciliation of the transactions affecting accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) included in shareholders 
    equity for the years ended December 31, was as follows:

Regulatory
    Capital    The measures used to assess capital by
    bank regulatory agencies include two principal risk-based
    ratios, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital. Tier 1
    capital is considered core capital and includes common
    shareholders  equity plus qualifying preferred stock, trust
    preferred securities and noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated subsidiaries (subject to certain limitations), and
    is adjusted for the aggregate impact of certain items included
    in other comprehensive income (loss). Total risk-based capital
    includes Tier 1 capital and other items such as
    subordinated debt and the allowance for credit losses. Both
    measures are stated as a percentage of risk-adjusted assets,
    which are measured based on their perceived credit risk and
    include certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as unfunded
    loan commitments, letters of credit, and derivative contracts.
    The Company is also subject to a leverage ratio requirement, a
    non risk-based asset ratio, which is defined as Tier 1
    capital as a percentage of average assets adjusted for goodwill
    and other non-qualifying intangibles and other assets.

For a summary of the regulatory capital requirements and the
    actual ratios as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, for the
    Company and its bank subsidiaries, see Table 20 included in
    Management s Discussion and Analysis, which is incorporated
    by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

U.S. BANCORP   97 

The following table provides the components of the
    Company s regulatory capital:

(a)    
     
      Includes the
    impact of items included in other comprehensive income (loss),
    such as unrealized gains (losses) on
     available-for-sale 
    securities, accumulated net gains on cash flow hedges, pension
    liability adjustments, etc.  

Noncontrolling interests principally represent preferred stock
    of consolidated subsidiaries. During 2006, the Company s
    primary banking subsidiary formed USB Realty Corp., a real
    estate investment trust, for the purpose of issuing
    5,000 shares of
     Fixed-to-Floating 
    Rate Exchangeable Non-cumulative Perpetual Series A
    Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per
    share ( Series A Preferred Securities ) to third
    party investors, and investing the proceeds in certain assets,
    consisting predominately of mortgage-backed securities from the
    Company. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Securities, if
    declared, will accrue and be payable quarterly, in arrears, at a
    rate per annum of 6.091 percent from December 22, 2006
    to, but excluding, January 15, 2012. On January 15,
    2012, the rate will be equal to three-month LIBOR for the
    related dividend period plus 1.147 percent. If USB Realty
    Corp. has not declared a dividend on the Series A Preferred
    Securities before the dividend payment date for any dividend
    period, such dividend shall not be cumulative and shall cease to
    accrue and be payable, and USB Realty Corp. will have no
    obligation to pay dividends accrued for such dividend period,
    whether or not dividends on the Series A Preferred
    Securities are declared for any future dividend period.

The Series A Preferred Securities will be redeemable, in
    whole or in part, at the option of USB Realty Corp. on the
    dividend payment date occurring in January 2012 and each fifth
    anniversary thereafter, or in whole but not in part, at the
    option of USB Realty Corp. on any dividend date before or after
    January 2012 that is not a five-year date. Any redemption will
    be subject to the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of
    the Currency.

Options and warrants outstanding at December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007, to purchase 70 million, 67 million and
    13 million common shares respectively, were not included in
    the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
    because they were antidilutive. Convertible senior debentures

98     U.S. BANCORP

that could potentially be converted into shares of the
    Company s common stock pursuant to specified formulas, were
    not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
    because they were antidilutive.

Note 17        Employee
    Benefits 

Employee
    Retirement Savings Plan
        The Company has a
    defined contribution retirement savings plan that covers
    substantially all its employees. Qualified employees are allowed
    to contribute up to 75 percent of their annual
    compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limits,
    through salary deductions under Section 401(k) of the
    Internal Revenue Code. Employee contributions are invested, at
    the employees  direction, among a variety of investment
    alternatives. Employee contributions are 100 percent
    matched by the Company, up to four percent of an employee s
    eligible annual compensation. The Company s matching
    contribution vests immediately. Although the matching
    contribution is initially invested in the Company s common
    stock, an employee can reinvest the matching contributions among
    various investment alternatives. Total expense was
    $78 million, $76 million and $62 million in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Pension Plans
        The Company has
    qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that
    provide benefits to substantially all its employees. Pension
    benefits are provided to eligible employees based on years of
    service, multiplied by a percentage of their final average pay.
    As a result of plan mergers, pension benefits may also be
    provided using two cash balance benefit formulas where only
    investment or interest credits continue to be credited to
    participants  accounts. Employees become vested upon
    completing five years of vesting service. Effective
    January 1, 2010, the Company established a new cash balance
    formula for certain current and all future eligible employees.
    Participants will receive annual pay credits based on eligible
    pay multiplied by a percentage determined by their age and years
    of service. Participants will also receive an annual interest
    credit. This new plan formula resulted in a $35 million
    reduction of the 2009 projected benefit obligation.

In general, the Company s qualified pension plans 
    objectives include maintaining a funded status sufficient to
    meet participant benefit obligations over time while reducing
    long-term funding requirements and pension costs. The Company
    has an established process for evaluating all the plans, their
    performance and significant plan assumptions, including the
    assumed discount rate and the long-term rate of return
    ( LTROR ). Annually, the Company s Compensation
    and Human Resources Committee (the  Committee ),
    assisted by outside consultants, evaluates plan objectives,
    funding policies and plan investment policies considering its
    long-term investment time horizon and asset allocation
    strategies. The process also evaluates significant plan
    assumptions. Although plan assumptions are established annually,
    the Company may update its analysis on an interim basis in order
    to be responsive to significant events that occur during the
    year, such as plan mergers and amendments.

The Company s funding policy is to contribute amounts to
    its plans sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements of
    the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
    by the Pension Protection Act, plus such additional amounts as
    the Company determines to be appropriate. The Company made no
    contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2009 or 2008,
    and anticipates no contributions in 2010. Any contributions made
    to the qualified plans are invested in accordance with
    established investment policies and asset allocation strategies.

In addition to the funded qualified pension plans, the Company
    maintains non-qualified plans that are unfunded and provide
    benefits to certain employees. The assumptions used in computing
    the present value of the accumulated benefit obligation, the
    projected benefit obligation and net pension expense are
    substantially consistent with those assumptions used for the
    funded qualified plans. In 2010, the Company expects to
    contribute $21 million to its non-qualified pension plans
    which equals the expected benefit payments.

Postretirement
    Welfare Plan     In
    addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides
    health care and death benefits to certain retired employees.
    Generally, all active employees may become eligible for retiree
    health care benefits by meeting defined age and service
    requirements. The Company may also subsidize the cost of
    coverage for employees meeting certain age and service
    requirements. The medical plan contains other cost-sharing
    features such as deductibles and coinsurance. The estimated cost
    of these retiree benefit payments is accrued during the
    employees  active service. In 2010, the Company expects to
    make no contributions to its postretirement welfare plan.

    duration for the qualified pension plans, non-qualified pension
    plans and postretirement welfare plan of 13.4, 10.5 and
    8.2 years, respectively. For 2008, the discount rates were
    developed using Towers Watson s cash flow matching bond
    model with a modified duration for the pension plans and
    postretirement welfare plan of 12.5 and 8.1 years,
    respectively.

Investment
    Policies and Asset Allocation
        In establishing its
    investment policies and asset allocation strategies, the Company
    considers expected returns and the volatility associated with
    different strategies. An independent consultant performs
    modeling that projects numerous outcomes using a broad range of
    possible scenarios, including a mix of possible rates of
    inflation and economic growth. Starting with current economic
    information, the model bases its projections on past
    relationships between inflation, fixed income rates and equity
    returns when these types of economic conditions have existed
    over the previous 30 years, both in the U.S. and in
    foreign countries.

Generally, based on historical performance of the various
    investment asset classes, investments in equities have
    outperformed other investment classes but are subject to higher
    volatility. While an asset allocation including debt securities
    and other assets generally has lower volatility and may provide
    protection in a declining interest rate environment, it limits
    the pension plans  long-term up-side potential. Given the
    pension plans  investment horizon and the financial
    viability of the Company to meet its funding objectives, the
    Committee has determined that an asset allocation strategy
    investing principally in equities diversified among various
    domestic equity categories and international equities is
    appropriate. The target asset allocation for the Company s
    qualified pension plans is 55 percent domestic large cap
    equities, 19 percent domestic mid cap equities,
    6 percent domestic small cap equities and 20 percent
    international equities.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, plan assets of the qualified
    pension plans included mutual funds that have asset management
    arrangements with related parties totaling $1.1 billion and
    $791 million, respectively.

Under a contractual agreement with FAF Advisors, Inc., an
    affiliate of the Company, certain plan assets are lent to
    qualified borrowers on a short-term basis in exchange for
    investment fee income. These borrowers collateralize the loaned
    securities with either cash or non-cash securities. Cash
    collateral held at December 31, 2009 and 2008 totaled
    $121 million and $151 million, respectively, with
    corresponding obligations to return the cash collateral of
    $131 million and $165 million, respectively.

Per authoritative accounting guidance, the Company groups plan
    assets into a three-level hierarchy for valuation techniques
    used to measure their fair value based on whether the valuation
    inputs are observable or unobservable. Refer to Note 21 for
    further discussion on these levels.

The assets of the qualified pension plans and postretirement
    welfare plan include investments in equity securities and mutual
    funds whose fair values are determined based on quoted market
    prices and such items are classified within Level 1 of the
    fair value hierarchy. The qualified pension plan also has
    investments in limited partnership interests whose fair value is
    determined by the Company by analyzing the limited
    partnerships  audited financial statements and other
    related investment activity. These securities are categorized as
    Level 3.

Note 18        Stock-Based
    Compensation 

As part of its employee and director compensation programs, the
    Company may grant certain stock awards under the provisions of
    the existing stock compensation plans, including plans assumed
    in acquisitions. The plans provide for grants of options to
    purchase shares of common stock at a fixed price equal to the
    fair value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Option
    grants are generally exercisable up to ten years from the date
    of grant. In addition, the plans provide for grants of shares of
    common stock or stock units that are subject to restriction on
    transfer prior to vesting. Most stock and unit awards vest over
    three to five years and are subject to forfeiture if certain
    vesting requirements are not met. Stock incentive plans of
    acquired companies are generally terminated at the merger
    closing dates. Option holders under such plans receive the
    Company s common stock, or options to buy the
    Company s stock, based on the conversion terms of the
    various merger agreements. The historical stock award
    information presented below has been restated to reflect the
    options originally granted under acquired companies  plans.
    At December 31, 2009, there were 27 million shares (subject
    to adjustment for forfeitures) available for grant under various
    plans.

Stock Option
    Awards  

The following is a summary of stock options outstanding and
    exercised under various stock options plans of the Company:

(a)

Options
    cancelled includes both non-vested (i.e., forfeitures) and
    vested options.   

(b)

Outstanding
    options include stock-based awards that may be forfeited in
    future periods. The impact of the estimated forfeitures is
    reflected in compensation expense.   

Stock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated fair
    value of the award at the date of grant or modification. The
    fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, requiring
    the use of subjective assumptions. Because employee stock
    options have characteristics that differ from those of traded
    options, including vesting provisions and trading limitations
    that impact their liquidity, the determined value used to
    measure compensation expense may vary from their actual fair
    value. The following table includes the weighted average
    estimated fair value and assumptions utilized by the Company for
    newly issued grants:

Expected stock volatility is based on several factors including
    the historical volatility of the Company s stock, implied
    volatility determined from traded options and other factors. The
    Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and
    employee terminations to estimate the expected life of options.
    The risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the options
    is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the
    date of grant. The expected dividend yield is based on the
    Company s expected dividend yield over the life of the
    options.

The following summarizes certain stock option activity of the
    Company:

To satisfy option exercises, the Company predominantly uses
    treasury stock.

Restricted Stock
    and Unit Awards  

A summary of the status of the Company s restricted shares
    of stock is presented below:

(a)

Includes
    maximum number of shares to be received by participants under
    awards that are based on the achievement of certain future
    performance criteria by the Company.   

The total fair value of shares vested was $12 million,
    $29 million, and $45 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Stock-based compensation expense was $89 million,
    $85 million and $77 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. On an after-tax basis, stock-based compensation
    was $55 million, $53 million and $48 million for
    2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. As of December 31,
    2009, there was $159 million of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to nonvested share-based arrangements
    granted under the plans. That cost is expected to be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years as compensation
    expense.

The components of income tax expense were:

U.S. BANCORP   105 

A reconciliation of expected income tax expense at the federal
    statutory rate of 35 percent to the Company s
    applicable income tax expense follows:

The tax effects of fair value adjustments on securities
     available-for-sale, 
    derivative instruments in cash flow hedges and certain tax
    benefits related to stock options are recorded directly to
    shareholders  equity as part of other comprehensive income
    (loss).

In preparing its tax returns, the Company is required to
    interpret complex tax laws and regulations and utilize income
    and cost allocation methods to determine its taxable income. On
    an ongoing basis, the Company is subject to examinations by
    federal, state and local government taxing authorities that may
    give rise to differing interpretations of these complex laws,
    regulations and methods. Due to the nature of the examination
    process, it generally takes years before these examinations are
    completed and matters are resolved. Included in earnings for
    2009, 2008 and 2007 were reductions in income tax expense and
    associated liabilities related to the resolution of various
    state income tax examinations which cover varying years from
    2001 through 2008 in different states. The resolution of these
    cycles was the result of negotiations held between the Company
    and representatives of various taxing authorities throughout the
    examinations. Federal tax examinations for all years ending
    through December 31, 2006, are completed and resolved.
    During 2009, the Internal Revenue Service began its examination
    of the Company s tax returns for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2008. The years open to examination
    by state and local government authorities vary by jurisdiction.

A reconciliation of the changes in the federal, state and
    foreign unrecognized tax positions balances are summarized as
    follows:

The total amount of unrecognized tax positions that, if
    recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, were $202 million and
    $187 million, respectively. The Company classifies interest
    and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions as a
    component of income tax expense. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized
    approximately $13 million and $19 million,
    respectively, in interest and had approximately $53 million
    accrued at December 31, 2009. Substantially all of the
    current year additions to uncertain tax positions relate to tax
    positions on the timing of the allowance of deductions for
    losses on various securities and debt obligations. The ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain, however the timing of
    deductibility is uncertain.

While certain examinations may be concluded, statutes may lapse
    or other developments may occur, the Company does not believe a
    significant increase or decrease in the uncertain tax positions
    will occur over the next twelve months.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax
    effect of estimated temporary differences between the carrying
    amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
    purposes and the amounts used for the same items for income tax
    reporting purposes.

106     U.S. BANCORP

The significant components of the Company s net deferred
    tax asset (liability) as of December 31 were:

The Company has established a valuation allowance to offset
    deferred tax assets related to federal, state and foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards which are subject to various
    limitations under the respective income tax laws and some of
    which may expire unused. The Company has approximately
    $604 million of federal, state and foreign net operating
    loss carryforwards which expire at various times through 2024.
    Management has determined a valuation reserve is not required
    for the remaining deferred tax assets because it is more likely
    than not these assets could be realized through carry back to
    taxable income in prior years, future reversals of existing
    taxable temporary differences and future taxable income.

Certain events covered by Internal Revenue Code
    section 593(e) will trigger a recapture of base year
    reserves of acquired thrift institutions. The base year reserves
    of acquired thrift institutions would be recaptured if an entity
    ceases to qualify as a bank for federal income tax purposes. The
    base year reserves of thrift institutions also remain subject to
    income tax penalty provisions that, in general, require
    recapture upon certain stock redemptions of, and excess
    distributions to, stockholders. At December 31, 2009,
    retained earnings included approximately $102 million of
    base year reserves for which no deferred federal income tax
    liability has been recognized.

Note
    20        Derivative
    Instruments 

The Company recognizes all derivatives in the consolidated
    balance sheet at fair value as other assets or liabilities. On
    the date the Company enters into a derivative contract, the
    derivative is designated as either a hedge of the fair value of
    a recognized asset or liability, including a hedge of foreign
    currency exposure ( fair value hedge  a hedge of a
    forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be
    paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow
    hedge  or a customer accommodation or an economic hedge
    for asset/liability risk management purposes
    ( free-standing derivative ).

Of the Company s $46.8 billion of total notional
    amount of asset and liability management positions at
    December 31, 2009, $15.4 billion was designated as a
    fair value or cash flow hedge. When a derivative is designated
    as either a fair value or cash flow hedge, the Company performs
    an assessment, at inception and quarterly thereafter to
    determine the effectiveness of the derivative in offsetting
    changes in the value of the hedged items.

Fair Value
    Hedges     These
    derivatives are primarily interest rate swaps that hedge the
    change in fair value related to interest rate changes of
    underlying fixed-rate debt and junior subordinated debentures.
    Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair
    value hedges, and changes in the fair value of the hedged items,
    are recorded in earnings.

U.S. BANCORP   107 

The change in fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness was
    not material.

The Company also uses forward commitments to sell specified
    amounts of certain foreign currencies and foreign denominated
    debt to hedge the volatility of its investment in foreign
    operations as driven by fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates. The net amount of gains or losses included in
    the cumulative translation adjustment for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was not material.

Cash Flow
    Hedges     These
    derivatives are interest rate swaps that are hedges of the
    forecasted cash flows from the underlying variable-rate debt.
    Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow
    hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until
    income from the cash flows of the hedged items is realized. If a
    derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or
    ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss in other
    comprehensive income (loss) is amortized to earnings over the
    period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If a
    hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, hedge
    accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in other
    comprehensive income (loss) is reported in earnings immediately.
    At December 31, 2009, the Company had $327 million of
    realized and unrealized losses on derivatives classified as cash
    flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income (loss),
    compared with $650 million at December 31, 2008. The
    estimated amount to be reclassified from other comprehensive
    income (loss) into earnings during the next 12 months is a
    loss of $126 million. This includes gains and losses
    related to hedges that were terminated early for which the
    forecasted transactions are still probable. All cash flow hedges
    were highly effective for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    and the change in fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness
    was not material.

Other
    Derivative Positions
        The Company enters
    into free standing derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk
    and for other risk management purposes. These derivatives
    include forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans
    which are used to economically hedge the interest rate risk
    related to residential mortgage loan production activities. The
    Company also enters into U.S. Treasury futures, options on
    U.S. Treasury futures contracts and forward commitments to
    buy residential mortgage loans to economically hedge the change
    in the fair value of the Company s residential MSRs. In
    addition, the Company acts as a seller and buyer of interest
    rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts to accommodate
    its customers. To mitigate the market and liquidity risk
    associated with these derivatives, the Company enters into
    similar offsetting positions.

    entering into derivative transactions and its overall risk
    management strategies, refer to  Management Discussion and
    Analysis   Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate

    the netting of derivative receivables and payables when a
    legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the
    Company and a derivative counterparty. A master netting
    agreement is an agreement between two counterparties who have
    multiple derivative contracts with each other that provide for
    the net settlement of contracts through a single payment, in a
    single currency, in the event of default on or termination of
    any one contract. At December 31, 2009, the amount of cash
    collateral posted by counterparties that was netted against
    derivative assets was $116 million and the amount of cash
    collateral posted by the Company that was netted against
    derivative liabilities was $691 million.

Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with
    counterparties to the derivative contracts. The Company measures
    that credit risk based on its assessment of the probability of
    counterparty default and includes that within the fair value of
    the derivative. The Company manages counterparty credit risk
    through diversification of its derivative positions among
    various counterparties, by entering into master netting
    agreements and by requiring collateral agreements which allow
    the Company to call for immediate, full collateral coverage when
    credit-rating thresholds are triggered by counterparties. The
    balances in the table on page 109 do not reflect the impact of
    these risk mitigation techniques.

The Company s collateral agreements are bilateral, and
    therefore contain provisions that require collateralization of
    the Company s net liability derivative positions. Required
    collateral coverage is based on certain net liability thresholds
    and contingent upon the Company s credit rating from two of
    the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. If
    the Company s credit rating were to fall below credit
    ratings thresholds established in the collateral agreements, the
    counterparties to the derivatives could request immediate full
    collateral coverage for derivatives in net liability positions.
    The aggregate fair value of all derivatives under collateral
    agreements that were in a net liability position at
    December 31, 2009, was $1.2 billion. At
    December 31,

110     U.S. BANCORP

2009, the Company had $691 million of cash posted as
    collateral against this net liability position.

Note 21         

Fair
    Values of Assets And Liabilities

The Company uses fair value measurements for the initial
    recording of certain assets and liabilities, periodic
    remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities, and
    disclosures. Derivatives, investment securities, certain
    mortgage loans held for sale ( MLHFS ) and MSRs are
    recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from
    time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair
    value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held
    for sale, loans held for investment and certain other assets.
    These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve
    application of
     lower-of-cost-or-fair 
    value accounting or impairment write-downs of individual assets.

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be
    received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit
    price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
    asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement
    reflects all of the assumptions that market participants would
    use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions
    about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the
    effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the
    risk of nonperformance.

The Company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair
    value into a three-level hierarchy for valuation techniques used
    to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. This hierarchy
    is based on whether the valuation inputs are observable or
    unobservable. These levels are:

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 includes
    U.S. Treasury and exchange-traded instruments.

Level 2   Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Level 2 includes debt securities
    that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments
    and which are valued using third party pricing services;
    derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing
    model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be
    derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
    data; and MLHFS whose values are determined using quoted prices
    for similar assets or pricing models with inputs that are
    observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable
    market data.

Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and
    liabilities include financial instruments whose values are
    determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
    methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for
    which the determination of fair value requires significant
    management judgment or estimation. This category includes
    residential MSRs, certain debt securities, including the
    Company s SIV-related investments and non-agency
    mortgaged-backed securities, and certain derivative contracts.

The following section describes the valuation methodologies used
    by the Company to measure financial assets and liabilities at
    fair value and for estimating fair value for financial
    instruments not recorded at fair value as required under
    disclosure guidance related to the fair value of financial
    instruments. In addition, for financial assets and liabilities
    measured at fair value, the following section includes an
    indication of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the
    assets or liabilities are classified. Where appropriate, the
    description includes information about the valuation models and
    key inputs to those models.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents     The
    carrying value of cash, amounts due from banks, federal funds
    sold and securities purchased under resale agreements was
    assumed to approximate fair value.

Investment
    Securities     When
    available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair
    value of investment securities and such items are classified
    within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

For other securities, the Company determines fair value based on
    various sources and may apply matrix pricing with observable
    prices for similar securities where a price for the identical
    security is not observable. Prices are verified, where possible,
    to prices of observable market trades as obtained from
    independent sources. Securities measured at fair value by such
    methods are classified as Level 2.

The fair value of securities for which there are no market
    trades, or where trading is inactive as compared to normal
    market activity, are categorized as Level 3. Securities
    classified as Level 3 include non-agency mortgage-backed
    securities, SIVs, commercial mortgage-backed and asset-

U.S. BANCORP   111 

backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and
    collateralized loan obligations, and certain corporate debt
    securities. In 2009, due to the limited number of trades of
    non-agency mortgage-backed securities and lack of reliable
    evidence about transaction prices, the Company determined the
    fair value of these securities using a cash flow methodology and
    incorporating observable market information, where available.
    The use of a cash flow methodology resulted in the Company
    transferring some non-agency mortgage-backed securities to
    Level 3. This transfer did not impact earnings and was not
    significant to shareholders  equity of the Company or the
    carrying amount of the securities.

Cash flow methodologies and other market valuation techniques
    involving management judgment use assumptions regarding housing
    prices, interest rates and borrower performance. Inputs are
    refined and updated to reflect market developments. The primary
    valuation drivers of these securities are the prepayment rates,
    default rates and default severities associated with the
    underlying collateral, as well as the discount rate used to
    calculate the present value of the projected cash flows.

The following table shows the valuation assumption ranges for
    Level 3 non-agency mortgage-backed securities at
    December 31, 2009:

(a)

Prime
    securities are those designated as such by the issuer or those
    with underlying asset characteristics and/or credit enhancements
    consistent with securities designated as prime.   

Certain
    mortgage loans held for sale
        MLHFS measured at
    fair value, for which an active secondary market and readily
    available market prices exist, are initially valued at the
    transaction price and are subsequently valued by comparison to
    instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. Included
    in mortgage banking revenue for the year ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008, was $206 million of net gains and
    $65 million of net losses, respectively, from the initial
    measurement and subsequent changes to fair value of these MLHFS
    under fair value option accounting guidance. Changes in fair
    value due to instrument specific credit risk were immaterial.
    The fair value of MLHFS was $4.3 billion as of
    December 31, 2009, which exceeded the unpaid principal
    balance by $63 million as of that date. MLHFS are
    Level 2. Related interest income for MLHFS is measured
    based on contractual interest rates and reported as interest
    income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Electing to
    measure MLHFS at fair value reduces certain timing differences
    and better matches changes in fair value of these assets with
    changes in the value of the derivative instruments used to
    economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the
    requirements for hedge accounting.

Loans
        The loan portfolio
    includes adjustable and fixed-rate loans, the fair value of
    which was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and
    other valuation techniques. To calculate discounted cash flows,
    the loans were aggregated into pools of similar types and
    expected repayment terms. The expected cash flows of loans
    considered historical prepayment experiences and estimated
    credit losses for nonperforming loans and were discounted using
    current rates offered to borrowers of similar credit
    characteristics. Generally, loan fair values reflect
    Level 3 information.

Mortgage
    servicing rights
        MSRs are valued
    using a cash flow methodology and third party prices, if
    available. Accordingly, MSRs are classified in Level 3. The
    Company determines fair value by estimating the present value of
    the asset s future cash flows using market-based prepayment
    rates, discount rates, and other assumptions validated through
    comparison to trade information, industry surveys, and
    independent third party appraisals. Risks inherent in MSRs
    valuation include higher than expected prepayment rates
     and/or 
    delayed receipt of cash flows.

Derivatives
        Exchange-traded
    derivatives are measured at fair value based on quoted market
    (i.e. exchange) prices. Because prices are available for the
    identical instrument in an active market, these fair values are
    classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The majority of derivatives held by the Company are executed
     over-the-counter 
    and are valued using standard cash flow, Black-Scholes and Monte
    Carlo valuation techniques. The models incorporate inputs,
    depending on the type of derivative, including interest rate
    curves, foreign exchange rates and volatility. In addition, all
    derivative values incorporate an assessment of the risk of
    counterparty

112     U.S. BANCORP

nonperformance, measured based on the Company s evaluation
    of credit risk as well as external assessments of credit risk,
    where available. In its assessment of nonperformance risk, the
    Company considers its ability to net derivative positions under
    master netting agreements, as well as collateral received or
    provided under collateral support agreements. The majority of
    these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair
    value hierarchy as the significant inputs to the models are
    observable. An exception to the Level 2 classification is
    certain derivative transactions for which the risk of
    nonperformance cannot be observed in the market. These
    derivatives are classified within Level 3 of the fair value
    hierarchy. In addition, commitments to sell, purchase and
    originate mortgage loans that meet the requirements of a
    derivative, are valued by pricing models that include market
    observable and unobservable inputs. Due to the significant
    unobservable inputs, these commitments are classified within
    Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Deposit
    Liabilities     The fair
    value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money
    market deposits is equal to the amount payable on demand. The
    fair value of fixed-rate certificates of deposit was estimated
    by discounting the contractual cash flow using current market
    rates.

Short-term
    Borrowings     Federal
    funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase,
    commercial paper and other short-term funds borrowed have
    floating rates or short-term maturities. The fair value of
    short-term borrowings was determined by discounting contractual
    cash flows using current market rates.

Long-term Debt
        The fair value for
    most long-term debt was determined by discounting contractual
    cash flows using current market rates. Junior subordinated debt
    instruments were valued using market quotes.

Loan
    Commitments, Letters of Credit and Guarantees
        The fair value of
    commitments, letters of credit and guarantees represents the
    estimated costs to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations
    with a third-party. The fair value of residential mortgage
    commitments is estimated based on observable inputs. Other loan
    commitments, letters of credit and guarantees are not actively
    traded, and the Company estimates their fair value based on the
    related amount of unamortized deferred commitment fees adjusted
    for the probable losses for these arrangements.

Note 22        Guarantees
    and Contingent Liabilities 

Commitments to
    Extend Credit  

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding and generally
    have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. The
    contractual amount represents the Company s exposure to
    credit loss, in the event of default by the borrower. The
    Company manages this credit risk by using the same credit
    policies it applies to loans. Collateral is obtained to secure
    commitments based on management s credit assessment of the
    borrower. The collateral may include marketable securities,
    receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate. Since the
    Company expects many of the commitments to expire without being
    drawn, total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent the
    Company s future liquidity requirements. In addition, the
    commitments include consumer credit lines that are cancelable
    upon notification to the consumer.

Letters of
    Credit  

Standby letters of credit are commitments the Company issues to
    guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. The
    guarantees frequently support public and private borrowing
    arrangements, including commercial paper issuances, bond
    financings and other similar transactions. The Company issues
    commercial letters of credit on behalf of customers to ensure
    payment or collection in connection with trade transactions. In
    the event of a customer s nonperformance, the
    Company s credit loss exposure is the same as in any
    extension of credit, up to the letter s contractual amount.
    Management assesses the borrower s credit to determine the
    necessary collateral, which may include marketable securities,
    receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate. Since the
    conditions requiring the Company to fund letters of credit may
    not occur, the Company expects its liquidity requirements to be
    less than the total outstanding commitments. The maximum
    potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under
    standby letter of credit arrangements at December 31, 2009,
    were approximately $17.9 billion with a weighted-average
    term of approximately 19 months. The estimated fair value
    of standby letters of credit was approximately $134 million
    at December 31, 2009.

The contract or notional amounts of commitments to extend credit
    and letters of credit at December 31, 2009, were as follows:

(a) Primarily
    cancelable at the Company s discretion.  

Lease
    Commitments  

Rental expense for operating leases totaled $253 million in
    2009, $234 million in 2008 and $213 million in 2007.
    Future minimum payments, net of sublease rentals, under
    capitalized leases and noncancelable operating leases with
    initial or remaining terms of one year or more, consisted of the
    following at December 31, 2009:

Guarantees  

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the Company to
    customers or other third-parties. The Company s guarantees
    primarily include parent guarantees related to
    subsidiaries  third-party borrowing arrangements;
    third-party performance guarantees inherent in the
    Company s business operations, such as indemnified
    securities lending programs and merchant charge-back guarantees;
    indemnification or buy-back provisions related to certain asset
    sales; and contingent consideration arrangements related to
    acquisitions. For certain guarantees, the Company has recorded a
    liability related to the potential obligation, or has access to
    collateral to support the

U.S. BANCORP   117 

guarantee or through the exercise of other recourse provisions
    can offset some or all of the maximum potential future payments
    made under these guarantees.

Third-Party
    Borrowing
    Arrangements    
        The Company provides
    guarantees to third-parties as a part of certain
    subsidiaries  borrowing arrangements, primarily
    representing guaranteed operating or capital lease payments or
    other debt obligations with maturity dates extending through
    2013. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the
    Company under these arrangements were approximately
    $135 million at December 31, 2009.

Commitments
    from Securities
    Lending    
        The Company participates
    in securities lending activities by acting as the
    customer s agent involving the loan of securities. The
    Company indemnifies customers for the difference between the
    market value of the securities lent and the market value of the
    collateral received. Cash collateralizes these transactions. The
    maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company
    under these arrangements were approximately $6.0 billion at
    December 31, 2009, and represented the market value of the
    securities lent to third-parties. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company held assets with a market value of $6.2 billion as
    collateral for these arrangements.

Assets
    Sales    
        The Company has provided
    guarantees to certain third-parties in connection with the sale
    or syndication of certain assets, primarily loan portfolios and
    low-income housing tax credits. These guarantees are generally
    in the form of asset buy-back or make-whole provisions that are
    triggered upon a credit event or a change in the tax-qualifying
    status of the related projects, as applicable, and remain in
    effect until the loans are collected or final tax credits are
    realized, respectively. The maximum potential future payments
    guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements were
    approximately $780 million at December 31, 2009, and
    represented the proceeds or the guaranteed portion received from
    the buyer in these transactions where the buy-back or make-whole
    provisions have not yet expired. Recourse available to the
    Company includes guarantees from the Small Business
    Administration (for SBA loans sold), recourse against the
    correspondent that originated the loan or to the private
    mortgage issuer, the right to collect payments from the debtors,
     and/or  the
    right to liquidate the underlying collateral, if any, and retain
    the proceeds. Based on its established
     loan-to-value 
    guidelines, the Company believes the recourse available is
    sufficient to recover future payments, if any, under the loan
    buy-back guarantees.

Merchant
    Processing    
        The Company, through its
    subsidiaries, provides merchant processing services. Under the
    rules of credit card associations, a merchant processor retains
    a contingent liability for credit card transactions processed.
    This contingent liability arises in the event of a billing
    dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately
    resolved in the cardholder s favor. In this situation, the
    transaction is  charged-back  to the merchant and the
    disputed amount is credited or otherwise refunded to the
    cardholder. If the Company is unable to collect this amount from
    the merchant, it bears the loss for the amount of the refund
    paid to the cardholder.

A cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally has until the
    latter of up to four months after the date the transaction is
    processed or the receipt of the product or service to present a
    charge-back to the Company as the merchant processor. The
    absolute maximum potential liability is estimated to be the
    total volume of credit card transactions that meet the
    associations  requirements to be valid charge-back
    transactions at any given time. Management estimates that the
    maximum potential exposure for charge-backs would approximate
    the total amount of merchant transactions processed through the
    credit card associations for the last four months. For the last
    four months this amount totaled approximately
    $65.5 billion. In most cases, this contingent liability is
    unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered
    when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned
    to merchants. However, where the product or service is not
    provided until a future date ( future delivery ), the
    potential for this contingent liability increases. To mitigate
    this risk, the Company may require the merchant to make an
    escrow deposit, may place maximum volume limitations on future
    delivery transactions processed by the merchant at any point in
    time, or may require various credit enhancements (including
    letters of credit and bank guarantees). Also, merchant
    processing contracts may include event triggers to provide the
    Company more financial and operational control in the event of
    financial deterioration of the merchant.

The Company s primary exposure to future delivery is
    related to merchant processing for airlines. The Company
    currently processes card transactions in the United States,
    Canada and Europe for airlines. In the event of liquidation of
    these merchants, the Company could become financially liable for
    refunding tickets purchased through the credit card associations
    under the charge-back provisions. Charge-back risk related to
    these merchants is evaluated in a manner similar to credit risk
    assessments and, as such, merchant processing contracts contain
    various provisions to protect the

118     U.S. BANCORP

Company in the event of default. At December 31, 2009, the
    value of airline tickets purchased to be delivered at a future
    date was $3.4 billion. The Company held collateral of
    $317 million in escrow deposits, letters of credit and
    indemnities from financial institutions, and liens on various
    assets. With respect to future delivery risk for other
    merchants, the Company held $38 million of merchant escrow
    deposits as collateral. In addition to specific collateral or
    other credit enhancements, the Company maintains a liability for
    its implied guarantees associated with future delivery. At
    December 31, 2009, the liability was $48 million
    primarily related to these airline processing arrangements.

In the normal course of business, the Company has unresolved
    charge-backs. The Company assesses the likelihood of its
    potential liability based on the extent and nature of unresolved
    charge-backs and its historical loss experience. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company had a recorded liability for
    potential losses of $17 million.

Contingent
    Consideration
    Arrangements    
        The Company has contingent
    payment obligations related to certain business combination
    transactions. Payments are guaranteed as long as certain
    post-acquisition performance-based criteria are met or customer
    relationships are maintained. At December 31, 2009, the
    maximum potential future payments required to be made by the
    Company under these arrangements was approximately
    $3 million. If required, the majority of these contingent
    payments are payable within the next 12 months.

Minimum
    Revenue
    Guarantees    
        In the normal course of
    business, the Company may enter into revenue share agreements
    with third party business partners who generate customer
    referrals or provide marketing or other services related to the
    generation of revenue. In certain of these agreements, the
    Company may guarantee that a minimum amount of revenue share
    payments will be made to the third party over a specified period
    of time. At December 31, 2009, the maximum potential future
    payments required to be made by the Company under these
    agreements was $24 million.

Other
    Guarantees    
        The Company has also made
    financial performance guarantees related to the operations of
    its subsidiaries. The maximum potential future payments
    guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements were
    approximately $7.8 billion at December 31, 2009.

Other Contingent
    Liabilities  

Visa
    Restructuring and Card Association
    Litigation    
        The Company s payment
    services business issues and acquires credit and debit card
    transactions through the Visa U.S.A. Inc. card association or
    its affiliates (collectively  Visa ). In 2007, Visa
    completed a restructuring and issued shares of Visa Inc. common
    stock to its financial institution members in contemplation of
    its initial public offering ( IPO ) completed in the
    first quarter of 2008 (the  Visa reorganization ). As
    a part of the Visa Reorganization, the Company received its
    proportionate number of shares of Visa Inc. common stock. In
    addition, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been
    named as defendants along with Visa U.S.A. Inc. ( Visa
    U.S.A. ) and MasterCard International (collectively, the
     Card Associations ), as well as several other banks,
    in antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of the Card
    Associations (the  Visa Litigation ). Visa U.S.A.
    member banks have a contingent obligation to indemnify Visa, Inc
    under the Visa U.S.A. bylaws (which were modified at the time of
    the restructuring in October 2007) for potential losses
    arising from the Visa Litigation. The contingent obligation of
    member banks under the Visa U.S.A. bylaws has no specific
    maximum amount. The Company has also entered into judgment and
    loss sharing agreements with Visa U.S.A. and certain other banks
    in order to apportion financial responsibilities arising from
    any potential adverse judgment or negotiated settlements related
    to the Visa Litigation.

In 2007 and 2008, Visa announced settlement agreements with
    American Express and Discover Financial Services, respectively.
    In addition to these settlements, Visa U.S.A. member banks
    remain obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. for potential losses
    arising from the remaining Visa litigation. Using proceeds from
    its initial IPO and through subsequent reductions to the
    conversion ratio applicable to the Class B shares held by
    member financial institutions, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow
    account for the benefit of member financial institutions to fund
    the expenses of the Visa Litigation, as well as the
    members  proportionate share of any judgments or
    settlements that may arise out of the Visa Litigation. The
    receivable related to the escrow account is classified in other
    liabilities as a direct offset to the related Visa Litigation
    liabilities and will decline as amounts are paid out of the
    escrow account. On July 16, 2009, Visa deposited additional
    funds into the escrow account and further reduced the conversion
    ratio applicable to the Class B shares. As a result, the
    Company recognized a

U.S. BANCORP   119 

$39 million gain related to the effective repurchase of a
    portion of its Class B shares.

At December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of the
    Company s liability related to the remaining Visa
    Litigation, was $115 million. The remaining Class B
    shares held by the Company will be eligible for conversion to
    Class A shares three years after the IPO or upon settlement
    of the Visa litigation, whichever is later.

Patent
    Infringement
    Litigation    
        In the ordinary course of
    business, the Company makes use of various technologies and
    business processes to provide products and services to its
    customers. From time to time the Company is the target of claims
    of persons alleging patent infringement with respect to these
    processes or products. Currently, the Company is a named
    defendant in a case filed in the U.S. District Court for
    the Eastern District of Texas,  DataTreasury Corp. v.
    Wells Fargo   Co., et al.  The plaintiff in that
    case alleges that the Company infringed on six patents involving
    digital imaging technology and processes related to check
    imaging. Because, among other things, similar technologies
    existed prior to the filing of these patents and the
    Company s technology and business processes differ from the
    plaintiff s patents, the Company believes the claims are
    without merit.

Other    
        The Company is subject to
    various other litigation, investigations and legal and
    administrative cases and proceedings that arise in the ordinary
    course of its businesses. Due to their complex nature, it may be
    years before some matters are resolved. While it is impossible
    to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial
    liability with respect to these contingent matters, including
    the  DataTreasury  case, discussed above, the Company
    believes that the aggregate amount of such liabilities will not
    have a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

U.S. BANCORP   121 

Transfer of funds (dividends, loans or advances) from bank
    subsidiaries to the Company is restricted. Federal law requires
    loans to the Company or its affiliates to be secured and
    generally limits loans to the Company or an individual affiliate
    to 10 percent of each bank s unimpaired capital and
    surplus. In the aggregate, loans to the Company and all
    affiliates cannot exceed 20 percent of each bank s
    unimpaired capital and surplus.

Dividend payments to the Company by its subsidiary banks are
    subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in
    some instances, regulatory approval. The approval of the
    Comptroller of the Currency is required if total dividends by a
    national bank in any calendar year exceed the bank s net
    income for that year combined with its retained net income for
    the preceding two calendar years, or if the bank s retained
    earnings are less than zero. Furthermore, dividends are
    restricted by the Comptroller of the Currency s minimum
    capital constraints for all national banks. Within these
    guidelines, all bank subsidiaries have the ability to pay
    dividends without prior regulatory approval. The amount of
    dividends available to the parent company from the bank
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2009, was approximately
    $2.8 billion.

Note 24        Subsequent
    Events 

The Company has evaluated the impact of events that have
    occurred subsequent to December 31, 2009 through the date
    the consolidated financial statements were filed with the United
    States Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on this
    evaluation, the Company has determined none of these events were
    required to be recognized in the consolidated financial
    statements.

    Information

General Business
    Description
       U.S. Bancorp is a
    multi-state financial services holding company headquartered in
    Minneapolis, Minnesota. U.S. Bancorp was incorporated in
    Delaware in 1929 and operates as a financial holding company and
    a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of
    1956. U.S. Bancorp provides a full range of financial
    services, including lending and depository services, cash
    management, foreign exchange and trust and investment management
    services. It also engages in credit card services, merchant and
    ATM processing, mortgage banking, insurance, brokerage and
    leasing.

U.S. Bancorp s banking subsidiaries are engaged in the
    general banking business, principally in domestic markets. The
    subsidiaries range in size from $51 million to
    $194 billion in deposits and provide a wide range of
    products and services to individuals, businesses, institutional
    organizations, governmental entities and other financial
    institutions. Commercial and consumer lending services are
    principally offered to customers within the Company s
    domestic markets, to domestic customers with foreign operations
    and within certain niche national venues. Lending services
    include traditional credit products as well as credit card
    services, financing and import/export trade, asset-backed
    lending, agricultural finance and other products. Leasing
    products are offered through bank leasing subsidiaries.
    Depository services include checking accounts, savings accounts
    and time certificate contracts. Ancillary services such as
    foreign exchange, treasury management and receivable lock-box
    collection are provided to corporate customers.
    U.S. Bancorp s bank and trust subsidiaries provide a
    full range of asset management and fiduciary services for
    individuals, estates, foundations, business corporations and
    charitable organizations.

U.S. Bancorp s non-banking subsidiaries primarily
    offer investment and insurance products to the Company s
    customers principally within its markets, and mutual fund
    processing services to a broad range of mutual funds.

Banking and investment services are provided through a network
    of 3,015 banking offices principally operating in 24 states
    in the Midwest and West. The Company operates a network of 5,148
    branded ATMs and provides
     24-hour, 
    seven day a week telephone customer service. Mortgage banking
    services are provided through banking offices and loan
    production offices throughout the Company s markets.
    Consumer lending products may be originated through banking
    offices, indirect correspondents, brokers or other lending
    sources, and a consumer finance division. The Company is also
    one of the largest providers of
    Visa   

    corporate and purchasing card services and corporate trust
    services in the United States. A wholly-owned subsidiary,
    Elavon, Inc. ( Elavon ), provides merchant processing
    services directly to merchants and through a network of banking
    affiliations. Affiliates of Elavon provide similar merchant
    services in Canada and segments of Europe. These foreign
    operations are not significant to the Company.

On a full-time equivalent basis, as of December 31, 2009,
    U.S. Bancorp employed 58,229 people.

Competition
       The commercial banking
    business is highly competitive. Subsidiary banks compete with
    other commercial banks and with other financial institutions,
    including savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks,
    finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit unions and
    investment companies. In recent years, competition has increased
    from institutions not subject to the same regulatory
    restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies.

Government
    Policies    The operations
    of the Company s various operating units are affected by
    federal and state legislative changes and by policies of various
    regulatory authorities, including those of the numerous states
    in which they operate, the United States and foreign
    governments. These policies include, for example, statutory
    maximum legal lending rates, domestic monetary policies of the
    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, United States
    fiscal policy, international currency regulations and monetary
    policies, U.S. Patriot Act and capital adequacy and
    liquidity constraints imposed by bank regulatory agencies.

Supervision and
    Regulation    As a
    registered bank holding company and financial holding company
    under the Bank Holding Company Act, U.S. Bancorp is subject
    to the supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors
    of the Federal Reserve System.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a financial holding company
    may engage in banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing
    or performing services for banks it controls, and conducting
    other financial activities. U.S. Bancorp must obtain the
    prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring
    more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of another
    bank or bank holding company, and must provide notice to, and in
    some situations obtain the prior approval of, the Federal
    Reserve Board in connection with engaging in, or acquiring more
    than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of a company
    engaged in, a new financial activity.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, U.S. Bancorp may
    acquire banks throughout the United States, subject only to
    state or federal deposit caps and state minimum age requirements.

U.S. BANCORP   129 

National banks are subject to the supervision of, and are
    examined by, the Comptroller of the Currency. All subsidiary
    banks of the Company are members of the Federal Deposit
    Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) and are subject to
    examination by the FDIC. In practice, the primary federal
    regulator makes regular examinations of each subsidiary bank
    subject to its regulatory review or participates in joint
    examinations with other federal regulators. Areas subject to
    regulation by federal authorities include the allowance for
    credit losses, investments, loans, mergers, issuance of
    securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches and
    other aspects of operations.

Risk Factors
        The following
    factors may adversely affect the Company s business,
    financial results or stock price.

Industry Risk
    Factors   

Difficult
    business and economic conditions may continue to adversely
    affect the financial services industry
        The Company s
    business activities and earnings are affected by general
    business conditions in the United States and abroad. The
    domestic and global economies have recently experienced dramatic
    downturns, with negative effects on the business, financial
    condition and results of operations of financial institutions in
    the United States and other countries, and a continuation or
    worsening of current financial market conditions could
    materially and adversely affect the Company s business,
    financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or
    the trading price of the Company s common stock. Dramatic
    declines in the housing and commercial real estate markets over
    the past two years, with falling real estate prices and
    increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have negatively
    impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans and
    resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial
    institutions. These write-downs have caused many financial
    institutions to seek additional capital, to reduce or eliminate
    dividends, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and,
    in some cases, to fail. Market developments may further erode
    consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in
    payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default
    rates, which may impact the Company s charge-offs and
    provision for credit losses. Continuing economic deterioration
    that affects household
     and/or 
    corporate incomes could also result in reduced demand for credit
    or fee-based products and services. A worsening of these
    conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these
    difficult market conditions on the Company and others in the
    financial services industry.

The Company
    may be adversely affected by proposed legislation and rulemaking
        The United States
    government and the Company s regulators have proposed
    legislation and rules that would impact the Company, and the
    Company expects to continue to face increased regulation. These
    laws and regulations, as well as restrictions contained in
    current or future rules implementing or related to them, may
    adversely affect the Company. Specifically, any governmental or
    regulatory action having the effect of requiring the Company to
    obtain additional capital, whether from governmental or private
    sources, could have a material dilutive effect on current
    shareholders. The Company may be required to pay significantly
    higher FDIC premiums because market developments have depleted
    the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves
    to insured deposits. Other proposals are pending that would
    impose significant fees or assessments on large financial
    institutions, including the Company. Legislation and regulation
    of overdraft fees, credit cards and other bank services, as well
    as changes in the Company s practices relating to those and
    other bank services, may affect the Company s revenue and
    other financial results. Other laws and regulations are expected
    to have the effect of increasing the Company s costs of
    doing business and reducing its revenues, and may limit its
    ability to pursue business opportunities or otherwise adversely
    affect its business. The Company faces increased regulation of
    its business and increased costs associated with these programs.

Other changes
    in the laws, regulations and policies governing financial
    services companies could alter the Company s business
    environment and adversely affect operations
        The Board of
    Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of
    money and credit in the United States. Its fiscal and monetary
    policies determine in a large part the Company s cost of
    funds for lending and investing and the return that can be
    earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the
    Company s net

130     U.S. BANCORP

interest margin. Federal Reserve Board policies can also
    materially affect the value of financial instruments that the
    Company holds, such as debt securities and mortgage servicing
    rights.

The Company and its bank subsidiaries are heavily regulated at
    the federal and state levels. This regulation is to protect
    depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking
    system as a whole. Congress and state legislatures and federal
    and state agencies continually review banking laws, regulations
    and policies for possible changes. Changes in statutes,
    regulations or policies could affect the Company in substantial
    and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of
    financial services and products that the Company offers
     and/or 
    increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial
    services and products. The Company cannot predict whether any of
    this potential legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the
    effect that it or any regulations would have on the
    Company s financial condition or results of operations.

The Company
    could experience an unexpected inability to obtain needed
    liquidity     The
    Company s liquidity could be constrained by an unexpected
    inability to access the capital markets due to a variety of
    market dislocations or interruptions. If the Company is unable
    to meet its funding needs on a timely basis, its business would
    be adversely affected.

The soundness
    of other financial institutions could adversely affect the
    Company     The
    Company s ability to engage in routine funding transactions
    could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial
    soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services
    institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,
    counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to
    many different counterparties, and the Company routinely
    executes transactions with counterparties in the financial
    industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks,
    investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other
    institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors
    or questions about, one or more financial services institutions,
    or the financial services industry generally, could lead to
    losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Many
    of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the
    event of default of the Company s counterparty or client.
    In addition, the Company s credit risk may be exacerbated
    when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon
    or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full
    amount of the financial instrument exposure due the Company.
    There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially
    and adversely affect the Company s results of operations.

The financial
    services industry is highly competitive, and competitive
    pressures could intensify and adversely affect the
    Company s financial results
        The Company operates
    in a highly competitive industry that could become even more
    competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and
    technological changes, as well as continued industry
    consolidation which may increase in connection with current
    economic and market conditions. The Company competes with other
    commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings
    banks, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit
    unions and investment companies. In addition, technology has
    lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to
    offer products and services traditionally provided by banks.
    Many of the Company s competitors have fewer regulatory
    constraints and some have lower cost structures. Also, the
    potential need to adapt to industry changes in information
    technology systems, on which the Company and financial services
    industry are highly dependent, could present operational issues
    and require capital spending.

Changes in
    consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and
    saving habits could adversely affect the Company s
    financial results
        Technology and other
    changes now allow many consumers to complete financial
    transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay
    bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank.
    This  disintermediation  could result in the loss of
    fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income
    generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer
    spending and saving habits could adversely affect the
    Company s operations, and the Company may be unable to
    timely develop competitive new products and services in response
    to these changes that are accepted by new and existing customers.

Changes in the
    domestic interest rate environment could reduce the
    Company s net interest income
        The operations of
    financial institutions such as the Company are dependent to a
    large degree on net interest income, which is the difference
    between interest income from loans and investments and interest
    expense on deposits and borrowings. An institution s net
    interest income is significantly affected by market rates of
    interest, which in turn are affected by prevailing economic
    conditions, by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal
    government and by the policies of various regulatory agencies.
    Like all financial institutions, the Company s balance
    sheet is

U.S. BANCORP   131 

affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Volatility in
    interest rates can also result in the flow of funds away from
    financial institutions into direct investments. Direct
    investments, such as U.S. Government and corporate
    securities and other investment vehicles (including mutual
    funds) generally pay higher rates of return than financial
    institutions, because of the absence of federal insurance
    premiums and reserve requirements.

Acts or
    threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by
    the United States or other governments could adversely affect
    general economic or industry conditions
        Geopolitical
    conditions may also affect the Company s earnings. Acts or
    threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by
    the United States or other governments in response to terrorism,
    or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or
    industry conditions.

Company Risk
    Factors   

The
    Company s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to
    cover actual losses
        Like all financial
    institutions, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses
    to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. The
    Company s allowance for loan losses is based on its
    historical loss experience as well as an evaluation of the risks
    associated with its loan portfolio, including the size and
    composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions
    and geographic concentrations within the portfolio. The stress
    on the United States economy and the local economies in which
    the Company does business may be greater or last longer than
    expected, resulting in, among other things, greater than
    expected deterioration in credit quality of the loan portfolio,
    or in the value of collateral securing those loans. In addition,
    the process the Company uses to estimate losses inherent in its
    credit exposure requires difficult, subjective, and complex
    judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how
    these economic predictions might impair the ability of its
    borrowers to repay their loans, which may no longer be capable
    of accurate estimation which may, in turn, impact the
    reliability of the process. Increases in the Company s
    allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual
    loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could
    continue to materially and adversely affect its financial
    results.

The Company
    may continue to suffer increased losses in its loan portfolio
    despite its underwriting practices
        The Company seeks to
    mitigate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to
    specific underwriting practices. These practices often include:
    analysis of a borrower s credit history, financial
    statements, tax returns and cash flow projections; valuation of
    collateral based on reports of independent appraisers; and
    verification of liquid assets. Although the Company believes
    that its underwriting criteria are, and historically have been,
    appropriate for the various kinds of loans it makes, the Company
    has already incurred high levels of losses on loans that have
    met these criteria, and may continue to experience higher than
    expected losses depending on economic factors and consumer
    behavior. In addition, the Company s ability to assess the
    creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models
    and approaches it uses to select, manage, and underwrite its
    customers become less predictive of future behaviors. Finally,
    the Company may have higher credit risk, or experience higher
    credit losses, to the extent its loans are concentrated by loan
    type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the
    borrower or collateral. For example, the Company s credit
    risk and credit losses can increase if borrowers who engage in
    similar activities are uniquely or disproportionately affected
    by economic or market conditions, or by regulation, such as
    regulation related to climate change. Continued deterioration of
    real estate values in states or regions where the Company has
    relatively larger concentrations of residential or commercial
    real estate could result in significantly higher credit costs.

Changes in
    interest rates can reduce the value of the Company s
    mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale, and can
    make its mortgage banking revenue volatile from quarter to
    quarter, which can negatively affect its earnings.
        The Company has a
    portfolio of mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ), which
    is the right to service a mortgage loan for a fee. The Company
    initially carries its MSRs using a fair value measurement of the
    present value of the estimated future net servicing income,
    which includes assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by
    borrowers. Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment
    assumptions and thus fair value. As interest rates fall,
    prepayments tend to increase as borrowers refinance, and the
    fair value of MSR s can decrease, which in turn reduces the
    Company s earnings.

An increase in interest rates tends to lead to a decrease in
    demand for mortgage loans, reducing the Company s income
    from loan originations. Although revenue from the Company s
    MSRs may increase at the same time through increases in fair
    value, this offsetting revenue effect, or  natural
    hedge,  is not perfectly correlated in amount or

132     U.S. BANCORP

timing. The Company typically uses derivatives and other
    instruments to hedge its mortgage banking interest rate risk,
    but this hedging activity may not always be successful. The
    Company could incur significant losses from its hedging
    activities, and there may be periods where it elects not to
    hedge its mortgage banking interest rate risk. As a result of
    these factors, mortgage banking revenue can experience
    significant volatility.

Maintaining or
    increasing the Company s market share may depend on
    lowering prices and market acceptance of new products and
    services     The
    Company s success depends, in part, on its ability to adapt
    its products and services to evolving industry standards. There
    is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower
    prices. Lower prices can reduce the Company s net interest
    margin and revenues from its fee-based products and services. In
    addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including
    internet services, could require the Company to make substantial
    expenditures to modify or adapt the Company s existing
    products and services. Also, these and other capital investments
    in the Company s businesses may not produce expected growth
    in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. The
    Company might not be successful in introducing new products and
    services, achieving market acceptance of its products and
    services, or developing and maintaining loyal customers.

Because the
    nature of the financial services business involves a high volume
    of transactions, the Company faces significant operational risks
        The Company operates
    in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on
    the ability of its employees and systems to process a high
    number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss
    resulting from the Company s operations, including, but not
    limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of
    the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by
    employees, errors relating to transaction processing and
    technology, breaches of the internal control system and
    compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster
    recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal
    actions that could arise as a result of an operational
    deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable
    regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their
    implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative
    publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control
    system, improper operation of systems or improper employee
    actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face
    regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.

The change in
    residual value of leased assets may have an adverse impact on
    the Company s financial results
        The Company engages
    in leasing activities and is subject to the risk that the
    residual value of the property under lease will be less than the
    Company s recorded asset value. Adverse changes in the
    residual value of leased assets can have a negative impact on
    the Company s financial results. The risk of changes in the
    realized value of the leased assets compared to recorded
    residual values depends on many factors outside of the
    Company s control, including supply and demand for the
    assets, condition of the assets at the end of the lease term,
    and other economic factors.

Negative
    publicity could damage the Company s reputation and
    adversely impact its business and financial results
        Reputation risk, or
    the risk to the Company s earnings and capital from
    negative publicity, is inherent in the Company s business.
    Negative publicity can result from the Company s actual or
    alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending
    practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and actions
    taken by government regulators and community organizations in
    response to those activities. Negative publicity can adversely
    affect the Company s ability to keep and attract customers,
    and can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action.
    Because most of the Company s businesses operate under the
     U.S. Bank  brand, actual or alleged conduct by
    one business can result in negative publicity about other
    businesses the Company operates. Although the Company takes
    steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with customers and
    other constituencies, the Company, as a large diversified
    financial services company with a high industry profile, is
    inherently exposed to this risk.

The
    Company s reported financial results depend on
    management s selection of accounting methods and certain
    assumptions and estimates
        The Company s
    accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how the
    Company records and reports its financial condition and results
    of operations. The Company s management must exercise
    judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting
    policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted
    accounting principles and reflect management s judgment
    regarding the most appropriate manner to report the
    Company s financial condition and results. In some cases,
    management must select the accounting policy or method to apply
    from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable
    under the circumstances, yet might result in the Company s
    reporting

U.S. BANCORP   133 

materially different results than would have been reported under
    a different alternative.

Certain accounting policies are critical to presenting the
    Company s financial condition and results. They require
    management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments
    about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts
    could be reported under different conditions or using different
    assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies
    include: the allowance for credit losses; estimations of fair
    value; the valuation of purchased loans and related
    indemnification assets; the valuation of mortgage servicing
    rights; the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets;
    and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates
    involved in these matters, the Company may be required to do one
    or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance
    for credit losses
     and/or 
    sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the
    reserve provided; recognize significant impairment on its
    goodwill and other intangible asset balances; or significantly
    increase its accrued taxes liability. For more information,
    refer to  Critical Accounting Policies  in this Annual
    Report.

Changes in
    accounting standards could materially impact the Company s
    financial statements
        From time to time,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board changes the financial
    accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation
    of the Company s financial statements. These changes can be
    hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company
    records and reports its financial condition and results of
    operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to
    apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the
    Company s restating prior period financial statements.

Acquisitions
    may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels
    or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in
    unforeseen integration difficulties
        The Company
    regularly explores opportunities to acquire financial services
    businesses or assets and may also consider opportunities to
    acquire other banks or financial institutions. The Company
    cannot predict the number, size or timing of acquisitions.

Difficulty in integrating an acquired business or company may
    cause the Company not to realize expected revenue increases,
    cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence,
     and/or  other
    projected benefits from the acquisition. The integration could
    result in higher than expected deposit attrition (run-off), loss
    of key employees, disruption of the Company s business or
    the business of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely
    affect the Company s ability to maintain relationships with
    customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of
    the acquisition. Also, the negative effect of any divestitures
    required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business
    combinations may be greater than expected.

The Company must generally receive federal regulatory approval
    before it can acquire a bank or bank holding company. In
    determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition,
    federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the
    effect of the acquisition on the competition, financial
    condition, and future prospects. The regulators also review
    current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence,
    experience, and integrity of management and its record of
    compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs
    of the communities to be served (including the acquiring
    institution s record of compliance under the Community
    Reinvestment Act) and the effectiveness of the acquiring
    institution in combating money laundering activities. In
    addition, the Company cannot be certain when or if, or on what
    terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be
    granted. The Company may be required to sell banks or branches
    as a condition to receiving regulatory approval.

If new laws
    were enacted that restrict the ability of the Company and its
    subsidiaries to share information about customers, the
    Company s financial results could be negatively affected
        The Company s
    business model depends on sharing information among the family
    of companies owned by U.S. Bancorp to better satisfy the
    Company s customer needs. Laws that restrict the ability of
    the companies owned by U.S. Bancorp to share information
    about customers could negatively affect the Company s
    revenue and profit.

The
    Company s business could suffer if the Company fails to
    attract and retain skilled people
        The Company s
    success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and
    retain key people. Competition for the best people in most
    activities the Company engages in can be intense. The Company
    may not be able to hire the best people or to keep them. Recent
    strong scrutiny of compensation practices has resulted and may
    continue to result in additional regulation and legislation in
    this area as well as additional legislative and regulatory
    initiatives, and there is no assurance that this will not cause
    increased turnover or impede the Company s ability to
    retain and attract the highest caliber employees.

134     U.S. BANCORP

The Company
    relies on other companies to provide key components of the
    Company s business infrastructure
        Third party vendors
    provide key components of the Company s business
    infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and
    mutual fund distribution. While the Company has selected these
    third party vendors carefully, it does not control their
    actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including
    as a result of their not providing the Company their services
    for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could
    adversely affect the Company s ability to deliver products
    and services to the Company s customers and otherwise to
    conduct its business. Replacing these third party vendors could
    also entail significant delay and expense.

Significant
    legal actions could subject the Company to substantial uninsured
    liabilities     The
    Company is from time to time subject to claims related to its
    operations. These claims and legal actions, including
    supervisory actions by the Company s regulators, could
    involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs. To
    protect itself from the cost of these claims, the Company
    maintains insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles
    that it believes are appropriate for its operations. However,
    the Company s insurance coverage may not cover all claims
    against the Company or continue to be available to the Company
    at a reasonable cost. As a result, the Company may be exposed to
    substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect
    the Company s results of operations and financial condition.

The Company is
    exposed to risk of environmental liability when it takes title
    to properties     In the
    course of the Company s business, the Company may foreclose
    on and take title to real estate. As a result, the Company could
    be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these
    properties. The Company may be held liable to a governmental
    entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury,
    investigation and
     clean-up 
    costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental
    contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up
    hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a
    property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation
    activities could be substantial. In addition, if the Company is
    the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, it may be
    subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages
    and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating
    from the property. If the Company becomes subject to significant
    environmental liabilities, its financial condition and results
    of operations could be adversely affected.

A natural
    disaster could harm the Company s business
        Natural disasters
    could harm the Company s operations through interference
    with communications, including the interruption or loss of the
    Company s websites, which would prevent the Company from
    obtaining deposits, originating loans and processing and
    controlling its flow of business, as well as through the
    destruction of facilities and the Company s operational,
    financial and management information systems. Additionally,
    natural disasters may significantly affect loan portfolios by
    damaging properties pledged as collateral and by impairing the
    ability of certain borrowers to repay their loans. The nature
    and level of natural disasters cannot be predicted and may be
    exacerbated by global climate change. The ultimate impact of a
    natural disaster on future financial results is difficult to
    predict and would be affected by a number of factors, including
    the extent of damage to the Company s assets or the
    relevant collateral, the extent to which damaged collateral is
    not covered by insurance, the extent to which unemployment and
    other economic conditions caused by the natural disaster
    adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay their loans,
    and the cost of collection and foreclosure moratoriums, loan
    forbearances and other accommodations granted to borrowers and
    other customers.

The Company
    faces systems failure risks as well as security risks, including
     hacking  and  identity theft 
        The computer systems
    and network infrastructure the Company and others use could be
    vulnerable to unforeseen problems. These problems may arise in
    both the Company s internally developed systems and the
    systems of its third-party service providers. The Company s
    operations are dependent upon its ability to protect computer
    equipment against damage from fire, power loss or
    telecommunication failure. Any damage or failure that causes an
    interruption in its operations could adversely affect its
    business and financial results. In addition, the Company s
    computer systems and network infrastructure present security
    risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or identity theft.

The Company
    relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity
    needs     The Company is
    a separate and distinct legal entity from its bank subsidiaries
    and non-bank subsidiaries. The Company receives substantially
    all of its cash from dividends paid by its subsidiaries. These
    dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on
    the Company s stock and interest and principal on its debt.
    Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the

U.S. BANCORP   135 

amount of dividends that its bank subsidiaries and certain of
    its non-bank subsidiaries may pay to the Company without
    regulatory approval. Also, the Company s right to
    participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s
    liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the
    subsidiary s creditors, except to the extent that any of
    the Company s claims as a creditor of that subsidiary may
    be recognized.

The Company
    has non-banking businesses that are subject to various risks and
    uncertainties     The
    Company is a diversified financial services company, and the
    Company s business model is based on a mix of businesses
    that provide a broad range of products and services delivered
    through multiple distribution channels. In addition to banking,
    the Company provides payment services, investments, mortgages
    and corporate and personal trust services. Although the Company
    believes its diversity helps lessen the effect of downturns in
    any one segment of its industry, it also means the
    Company s earnings could be subject to various specific
    risks and uncertainties related to these non-banking businesses.

The
    Company s stock price can be volatile
        The Company s
    stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of
    factors, including: actual or anticipated variations in the
    Company s quarterly operating results; recommendations by
    securities analysts; significant acquisitions or business
    combinations; strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital
    commitments by or involving the Company or the Company s
    competitors; operating and stock price performance of other
    companies that investors deem comparable to the Company; new
    technology used or services offered by the Company s
    competitors; news reports relating to trends, concerns and other
    issues in the financial services industry; and changes in
    government regulations. General market fluctuations, industry
    factors and general economic and political conditions and
    events, as well as interest rate changes, currency fluctuations,
    or unforeseen events such as terrorist attacks could cause the
    Company s stock price to decrease regardless of the
    Company s operating results.

CERTIFICATION
    PURSUANT TO  

RULE 13a-14(a)

         I have reviewed this Annual Report on
     Form 10-K 
    of U.S. Bancorp;

(2) 
 
         Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
    statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
    necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
    circumstances under which such statements were made, not
    misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

(3) 
 
         Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other

    operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the
    periods presented in this report;

(4) 
 
         The registrant s other certifying officers and I are
    responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
    and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act
     Rules 13a-15(e) 
    and
     15d-15(e)) 
    and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in

    for the registrant and have:

designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
    disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our

    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
