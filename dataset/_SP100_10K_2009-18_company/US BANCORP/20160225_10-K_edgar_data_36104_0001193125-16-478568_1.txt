   Forward-Looking Statements    
  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION APPEARS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995: This report contains
forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp ( U.S. Bancorp  or the  Company ). Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are
based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date hereof. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of
U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. A reversal or slowing of the current economic recovery or another severe
contraction could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp s revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets could experience a recurrence of significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain
financial institutions and lead to a tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a downturn in the residential real estate markets could cause
credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, U.S. Bancorp s business and financial performance is likely to be negatively impacted by recently enacted and future legislation and regulation. U.S. Bancorp s results could
also be adversely affected by deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in
the value of securities held in its investment securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; litigation; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; breaches in data security; effects
of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management s ability to effectively manage credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, interest
rate risk, liquidity risk and reputational risk.      For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to
differ from expectations, refer to the sections entitled  Corporate Risk Profile  on pages 42   67 and  Risk Factors  on pages 156   166 of the Company s 2015 Annual Report. However, factors other than these also
could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp s results, and the reader should not consider these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and U.S. Bancorp
undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.       General Business Description    
  U.S. Bancorp is a multi-state financial services holding company headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. U.S. Bancorp was incorporated in
Delaware in 1929 and operates as a financial holding company and a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. U.S. Bancorp provides a full range of financial services, including lending and depository services, cash management,
capital markets, and trust and investment management services. It also engages in credit card services, merchant and ATM processing, mortgage banking, insurance, brokerage and leasing.   
  U.S. Bancorp s banking subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association, is engaged in the general banking business, principally in
domestic markets. U.S. Bank National Association, with $310 billion in deposits at December 31, 2015, provides a wide range of products and services to individuals, businesses, institutional organizations, governmental entities and other
financial institutions. Commercial and consumer lending services are principally offered to customers within the Company s domestic markets, to domestic customers with foreign operations and to large national customers operating in specific
industries targeted by the Company. Lending   
         2   

services include traditional credit products as well as credit card services, lease financing and import/export trade, asset-backed lending, agricultural finance and other products. Depository
services include checking accounts, savings accounts and time certificate contracts. Ancillary services such as capital markets, treasury management and receivable lock-box collection are provided to corporate customers. U.S. Bancorp s bank and
trust subsidiaries provide a full range of asset management and fiduciary services for individuals, estates, foundations, business corporations and charitable organizations.      Other U.S. Bancorp non-banking subsidiaries offer investment and insurance products to the Company s customers principally within its markets, and fund administration services to a broad range of
mutual and other funds.      Banking and investment services are provided through a network of 3,133 banking offices principally
operating in the Midwest and West regions of the United States, through on-line services and over mobile devices. The Company operates a network of 4,936 ATMs and provides 24-hour, seven day a week telephone customer service. Mortgage banking
services are provided through banking offices and loan production offices throughout the Company s markets. Lending products may be originated through banking offices, indirect correspondents, brokers or other lending sources. The Company is
also one of the largest providers of corporate and purchasing card services and corporate trust services in the United States. A wholly-owned subsidiary, Elavon, Inc. ( Elavon ), provides merchant processing services directly to merchants
and through a network of banking affiliations. Wholly-owned subsidiaries, and affiliates of Elavon, provide similar merchant services in Canada, Mexico, Brazil and segments of Europe directly or through joint ventures with other financial
institutions. The Company also provides corporate trust and fund administration services in Europe. These foreign operations are not significant to the Company.      On a full-time equivalent basis, as of December 31, 2015, U.S. Bancorp employed 65,433 people.       Competition       The commercial banking business is highly competitive. The
Company competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, investment companies, credit card companies and a variety of other financial services,
advisory and technology companies. In recent years, competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Competition is based on a number of factors including,
among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates on loans and deposits, lending limits and customer convenience. The Company s ability to continue to compete effectively also
depends in large part on its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs.       Government Policies       The operations of the Company s various operating
units are affected by federal and state legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities, including those of the numerous states in which they operate, the United States and foreign governments. These policies include, for
example, statutory maximum legal lending rates, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Federal Reserve ), United States fiscal policy, international currency regulations and monetary
policies and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank regulatory agencies.       Supervision and Regulation    
  U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their
subsidiaries. This regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of   
         3   

depositors, the deposit insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ), consumers, the stability of the financial system in the United States, and the health
of the national economy, and not for investors in bank holding companies such as the Company.      This section summarizes certain
provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations
described below.       Dodd-Frank Act  Substantial changes to the regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries
have occurred and will continue to occur as a result of the enactment in 2010 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ). Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their application by
regulatory agencies, have had and will continue to have a material effect on the business and results of the Company and its subsidiaries.      The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulatory framework for financial services companies, and since its enactment has required significant rulemaking and numerous studies and reports that will
continue over the next several years. Among other things, it created a new Financial Stability Oversight Council (the  Council ) with broad authority to make recommendations covering enhanced prudential standards and more stringent
supervision for large bank holding companies and certain non-bank financial services companies. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly reduced interchange fees on debit card transactions, changed the preemption of state laws applicable to national banks,
increased the regulation of consumer mortgage banking and made numerous other changes, some of which are discussed below.      In
addition to the Dodd-Frank Act, other legislative and regulatory proposals affecting banks have been made in recent years both domestically and internationally. Among other things, these proposals include significant additional capital and liquidity
requirements and limitations on the size or types of activity in which banks may engage.       Federal Reserve Regulation 
The Company elected to become a financial holding company as of March 13, 2000, pursuant to the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the  GLBA ) that permit qualifying bank holding companies to engage in, and affiliate with
financial companies engaging in, a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company. Under the GLBA s system of functional regulation, the Federal Reserve acts as an umbrella regulator for the Company,
and certain of the Company s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries. U.S. Bank National Association is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the
 OCC ) and also by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC in certain areas. Supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of a bank s business and
condition, and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities. U.S. Bank National Association, and in some cases the Company and the Company s non-bank affiliates, must undergo
regular on-site examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency, which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities. If they deem the Company to be operating in a manner that is inconsistent with safe
and sound banking practices, the applicable regulatory agencies can require the entry into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders,
pursuant to which the Company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.      If a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards, the Federal Reserve may impose corrective
capital and managerial requirements on the financial holding company, and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct. See  Permissible
  
         4   

Business Activities  below. If the failure to meet these standards persists, a financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries, or cease all
activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies.      Federal Reserve regulations also provide that, if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act
( CRA ), the Federal Reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in the additional activities in which only financial holding companies may engage. See  Community Reinvestment Act 
below. At December 31, 2015, U.S. Bank National Association met the capital, management and CRA requirements necessary to permit the Company to conduct the broader activities permitted for financial holding companies under the GLBA.   
  The Dodd-Frank Act codified existing Federal Reserve policy requiring the Company to act as a source of financial strength to U.S. Bank
National Association, and to commit resources to support this subsidiary in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so. However, because the GLBA provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators,
the GLBA prohibits the Federal Reserve from requiring payment by a holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment. In those cases, the Federal Reserve could instead
require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, non-bank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured
depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that is at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company.   
   Enhanced Prudential Standards  In March 2014, the Federal Reserve finalized a rule relating to enhanced prudential standards
required under the Dodd-Frank Act for bank holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets. The prudential standards include enhanced risk-based capital and leverage requirements, enhanced liquidity requirements, enhanced risk
management and risk committee requirements, a requirement to submit a resolution plan, single-counterparty credit limits and stress tests. The rule incorporates the requirement that the Federal Reserve conduct annual supervisory capital adequacy
stress tests of covered companies under baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios, and requires covered companies to conduct their own capital adequacy stress tests. The rule provides for notification to a covered company as to which the
Council has determined to impose a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15-to-1, based upon the determination by the Council that (a) such company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States and (b) the imposition
of such a requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that the company poses to the financial stability of the United States.   
   OCC Heightened Standards  In September 2014, the OCC, under separate authority, finalized guidelines establishing heightened
standards for large national banks such as U.S. Bank National Association. The guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. The OCC may take action against institutions that fail
to meet these standards.       Permissible Business Activities  As a financial holding company, the Company may affiliate
with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature.  Financial in nature  activities include the following:
securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the United
States Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity.  Complementary activities  are activities that the Federal Reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and
that do not pose a safety and soundness risk.      The Company generally is not required to obtain Federal Reserve approval to
acquire a company (other than a bank holding company, bank or savings association) engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve. However, the
Dodd-  
         5   

Frank Act added a provision requiring approval if the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed $10 billion. Financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the
Federal Reserve before they may acquire more than 5 percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company, bank or savings association.   
   Interstate Banking  Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the  Riegle-Neal
Act ), a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years). Also, such an
acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide, or, if the acquisition is the bank
holding company s initial entry into the state, more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state (or any lesser or greater amount set by the state).   
  The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines to create interstate branches. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, banks are
permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered in that state.       Regulatory
Approval for Acquisitions  In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors, including the following: the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition and
future prospects (including current and projected capital ratios and levels); the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served
(including the acquiring institution s record of compliance under the CRA); the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities; and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more
concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for well-capitalized and
well-managed institutions.       Dividend Restrictions  The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
subsidiaries. Typically, the majority of the Company s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the Company by U.S. Bank National Association. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks.
     In general, dividends payable by U.S. Bank National Association and the Company s trust bank subsidiaries, as national
banking associations, are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation.      The OCC,
the Federal Reserve and the FDIC also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise (including the Company and U.S. Bank National Association), if, in the banking regulator s opinion,
payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. Subject to exceptions for well-capitalized and well-managed holding companies, Federal Reserve regulations also
require approval of holding company purchases and redemptions of its securities if the gross consideration paid exceeds 10 percent of consolidated net worth for any 12-month period.   
  In addition, Federal Reserve policy on the payment of dividends, stock redemptions and stock repurchases requires that bank holding
companies consult with and inform the Federal Reserve in advance of doing any of the following: declaring and paying dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns (e.g., declaring and paying dividends that exceed earnings for the period
for which dividends are being paid); redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments when experiencing financial weakness; and redeeming or repurchasing common stock and perpetual preferred stock, if the result will be a net reduction in the amount of
such capital instruments outstanding for the quarter in which the reduction occurs.   
         6   

In 2010, the Federal Reserve issued an addendum to its policy on dividends, stock
redemptions and stock repurchases that is specifically applicable to the 19 largest bank holding companies (including the Company) that are covered by the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program. The addendum provides for Federal Reserve review of
dividend increases, implementation of capital repurchase programs and other capital repurchases or redemptions.      The
supervisory stress tests of the Company conducted by the Federal Reserve as part of its annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ( CCAR ) process also affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends and make other forms of
capital distribution. See  Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  and  Stress Testing  below.   
   Capital Requirements  The Company is subject to regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve, and U.S. Bank
National Association is subject to substantially similar rules established by the OCC. These requirements have changed significantly as a result of standards established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the  BCBS ), an
international organization that has the goal of creating standards for banking regulation, and the implementation of these standards and of relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by banking regulators in the United States. Minimum regulatory
capital levels will significantly increase as these requirements are implemented and phased in.      Prior to 2014, regulatory
capital requirements effective for the Company followed the 1988 capital accord of the BCBS known as Basel I. In implementing Basel I, federal banking regulators adopted risk-based capital and leverage rules that require the capital-to-assets ratios
of financial institutions to meet certain minimum standards. The risk-based capital ratio is calculated by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet financial instruments into risk-weighted categories (with higher levels of capital being
required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk), and is used to determine the amount of a financial institution s total risk-weighted assets ( RWAs ). Under the rules, capital is divided into two tiers: tier 1
capital and tier 2 capital. The amount of tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of tier 1 capital. Total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital. The federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio
guidelines. The leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total on-balance sheet assets.      The
Federal Reserve and the OCC approved a final rule in 2007 adopting international guidelines established by the BCBS known as Basel II. The Basel II framework consists of three pillars: (a) capital adequacy; (b) supervisory review
(including the computation of capital and internal assessment processes); and (c) market discipline (including increased disclosure requirements). In December 2010, the BCBS issued a new set of international standards for determining regulatory
capital known as Basel III. Federal banking regulators published the U.S. Basel III final rule in July 2013 to implement many aspects of these international standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The U.S. Basel III final rule
focuses regulatory capital on common equity tier 1 capital, introduces new regulatory adjustments and deductions from capital, narrows the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and makes other changes to the Basel I and Basel II
frameworks. Specifically, Basel III includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets: a general standardized approach and more risk-sensitive advanced approaches, with the Company s capital adequacy being evaluated
against the Basel III methodology that is most restrictive. In December 2013, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule to revise the market risk capital rule, which addresses the market risk of significant trading activities, so that it conforms to
the Basel III capital framework. The revised market risk capital rule was effective April 1, 2014.      Beginning
January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements for the Company follow Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the following four years to full implementation by January 1, 2018. Under the U.S. Basel III
final rule, the Company is subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio (common equity tier 1 capital to RWA) of 4.5 percent, a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0 percent on a fully
phased-in basis. In addition, the final rule provides that certain new items be deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and certain Basel I deductions be modified. The

Company is also subject to a 2.5 percent common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer and, if deployed, up to a 2.5 percent common equity tier 1 countercyclical buffer on a fully phased-in
basis by 2019. The U.S. Basel III final rule establishes a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 percent for all U.S. banking organizations. The final rule also subjects banking organizations calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches,
including the Company, to a minimum Basel III supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0 percent that takes into account certain off-balance sheet exposures.      The U.S. banking regulators also published final regulations in June 2011 implementing the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires that certain institutions supervised by the Federal
Reserve, including the Company, be subject to minimum capital requirements that are not less than the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements. Prior to 2015, this minimum  capital floor  was based on Basel I. On
January 1, 2015, the U.S. Basel III final rule replaced the Basel I-based  capital floor  with a standardized approach that, among other things, modifies the existing risk weights for certain types of asset classes. The  capital
floor  applies to the calculation of both minimum risk-based capital requirements as well as the capital conservation buffer and, if deployed, the countercyclical capital buffer.   
  In September 2014, U.S banking regulators approved a final rule that enhanced the regulatory Supplemental Leverage Ratio
( SLR ) requirement for banks calculating capital adequacy using advanced approaches under Basel III. The SLR is defined as tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure, which includes both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The
Company began calculating and reporting its SLR beginning in the first quarter of 2015; however, it is not subject to the minimum SLR requirement until January 1, 2018. At December 31, 2015, the Company exceeds the applicable minimum SLR
requirement.      For additional information regarding the Company s regulatory capital, see  Capital Management 
in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on pages 65-67.       Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  The Federal
Reserve s Capital Plans rule requires large bank holding companies with assets in excess of $50 billion to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis and to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve for capital distributions
proposed in the capital plan. These capital plans consist of a number of mandatory elements, including an assessment of a company s sources and uses of capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful
conditions; a detailed description of a company s process for assessing capital adequacy; a demonstration of a company s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier 1 common ratio of 5.0 percent
under expected and stressful conditions; and a demonstration of a company s ability to achieve, readily and without difficulty, the minimum capital ratios and capital buffers under the Basel III framework as it comes into effect in the United
States.      The Federal Reserve has issued a final rule specifying how large bank holding companies, including the Company,
should incorporate the U.S. Basel III capital standards into their capital plans. Among other things, the final rule requires large bank holding companies to project both their common equity tier 1 capital ratio using the methodology under existing
capital guidelines and their common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the U.S. Basel III capital standards, as such standards phase in over the nine-quarter planning horizon.      The Company will submit its 2016 capital plan to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2016, in accordance with instructions from the Federal Reserve. Applicable stress testing rules require the Federal
Reserve to publish the results of its assessment of the Company s capital plan, including its planned capital distributions, no later than June 30, 2016.       Stress Testing  The Federal Reserve s CCAR framework and the Dodd-Frank Act stress testing framework require large bank holding companies such as the Company to conduct company-run stress tests
and subject them to supervisory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve. Among other things, the company-run stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the Company as well as stress scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve
  
         8   

and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act capital actions, which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large U.S. bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve conducts CCAR and
Dodd-Frank supervisory stress tests employing its adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios and internal supervisory models. The Federal Reserve s CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests incorporate the Company s planned
capital actions and the Dodd-Frank Act capital actions, respectively. The Federal Reserve and the Company are required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and annual company-run stress tests, respectively, no later than June 30 of
each year. In addition, all large bank holding companies are required to submit a mid-cycle company-run stress test employing stress scenarios developed by the Company. The results of this stress test must be submitted to the Federal Reserve for
review in early July of each year. The Company is required to publish its results of this stress test no later than the end of September of each year. The Federal Reserve currently publishes summaries of supervisory stress test results for each
large bank holding company under both the adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios developed by the Federal Reserve.   
  National banks with assets in excess of $50 billion are required to submit annual company-run stress test results to the OCC concurrently
with their parent bank holding company s CCAR submission to the Federal Reserve. The stress test is based on the OCC s stress scenarios (which are typically the same as the Federal Reserve s stress scenarios) and capital actions that
are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario. U.S. Bank National Association will submit its stress test in accordance with regulatory requirements by April 5, 2016. The Company is required to publish the results of this
stress test no later than June 30, 2016.       Basel III Liquidity Proposals  The BCBS proposed in 2009 two minimum
standards for limiting liquidity risk: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ( LCR ) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio ( NSFR ). The LCR is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to
survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days. The NSFR is designed to promote stable, longer-term funding of assets and business activities over a one-year time horizon.   
  In October 2014, the federal banking regulators finalized a rule to implement the LCR in the United States. The rule applies the LCR
standards to bank holding companies and their U.S. bank subsidiaries calculating their capital requirements using advanced approaches, including the Company and U.S. Bank National Association. The LCR standards in the rule differ in certain respects
from the BCBS s version of the LCR, including a narrower definition of high-quality liquid assets, different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions, a different methodology for
calculating the LCR and a shorter phase-in schedule that ends on December 31, 2016. The federal banking regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR in the United States. The BCBS, however, finalized the NSFR standard in October
2014 and U.S. regulators are expected to use this framework as a basis for domestic regulation. The BCBS contemplates that the NSFR, including any revisions, will be implemented as a minimum standard by January 1, 2018.   
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the
 FDICIA ) provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates (including parent holding companies) by federal banking regulators. As part of that framework, the FDICIA requires the relevant federal banking
regulator to take  prompt corrective action  with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards.      Supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the  prompt corrective action  rules generally depend upon an institution s classification within five capital
categories. The U.S. Basel III final rule revises the capital ratio thresholds in the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new Basel III capital ratios. This aspect of the U.S. Basel III rule became effective on January 1, 2015.
The regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the Company; however, subject to limitations that may be imposed pursuant to the GLBA, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company
level, based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company s subsidiary banking institutions. In certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution, the bank holding company would be required
  
         9   

to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments.
      Deposit Insurance  Under current FDIC regulations, each depository institution is assigned to a risk category based on
capital and supervisory measures. A depository institution is assessed premiums by the FDIC based on its risk category and the amount of deposits held. In 2009, the FDIC revised the method for calculating the assessment rate for depository
institutions by introducing several adjustments to an institution s initial base assessment rate. The Dodd-Frank Act altered the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments from a deposit to an asset base, and seeks to fund part of the
cost of the Dodd-Frank Act by increasing the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund to 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that FDIC assessments be set in a manner that offsets the cost of the assessment
increases for institutions with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. This provision effectively places the increased assessment costs on larger financial institutions such as the Company.   
  The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 per account ownership type to $250,000. In
February 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule implementing the Dodd-Frank Act provisions, which provides for use of a risk scorecard to determine deposit premiums. The effect of the rule was to increase the FDIC premiums paid by U.S. Bank National
Association. In 2014, the FDIC adopted a final rule revising its deposit insurance assessment system to reflect changes in the regulatory capital rules that are effective in 2015 and 2018. The rule (a) revises the ratios and ratio thresholds
relating to capital evaluations; (b) revises the assessment base calculation for custodial banks; and (c) requires that all highly complex institutions measure counterparty exposure for assessment purposes using the Basel III standardized
approach in the regulatory capital rules.      In November 2015, in order to bring the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund
to 1.35 percent, the FDIC proposed a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The proposed surcharges would be imposed the calendar quarter after the reserve
ratio of the deposit insurance fund first reaches or exceeds 1.15 percent and would continue through the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35 percent. The surcharge imposed on each insured depository institution would equal
an annual rate of 4.5 basis points applied to the institution s assessment base (with certain adjustments). The FDIC expects that these surcharges will commence in 2016 and that they should be sufficient to raise the reserve ratio to 1.35
percent in approximately eight quarters (i.e., before the end of 2018). If, contrary to the FDIC s expectations, the reserve ratio does not reach 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018, the FDIC plans to impose a shortfall assessment on insured
depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more on March 31, 2019.       Powers of the FDIC
Upon Insolvency of an Insured Institution  If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the power to (a) transfer any of the depository
institution s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution s creditors; (b) enforce the terms of the depository institution s contracts pursuant to their terms; or (c) repudiate
or disaffirm any contracts (if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract is burdensome and that the repudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution). These provisions would be
applicable to obligations and liabilities of the Company s insured depository institution subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association.       Depositor Preference  Under federal law, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative
expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities (including the FDIC, as subrogee of the depositors) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including holders of publicly issued senior or
subordinated debt and depositors in non-domestic offices. As a result, those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors in domestic offices of the depository.
  
         10   

Orderly Liquidation Authority  The Dodd-Frank Act created a new framework for the
orderly liquidation of a covered financial company by the FDIC as receiver. A covered financial company is a financial company (including a bank holding company, but not an insured depository institution), in situations where the Secretary of the
Treasury determines (upon the written recommendation of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve and after consultation with the President) that the conditions set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of the
financial company s failure have been met. The rule sets forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company. The Company is a financial company and therefore is potentially subject to the orderly liquidation
authority of the FDIC.       Resolution Plans  The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted a rule to implement the
requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding annual resolution plans for bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more (so-called  Living Wills ). The rule requires each covered company to produce a contingency resolution plan
for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company in the event of material financial distress or failure. Resolution plans must include information regarding the manner and extent to which any insured depository institution affiliated with the
company is adequately protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the company; full descriptions of ownership structure, assets, liabilities and contractual obligations of the company; identification of the
cross-guarantees tied to different securities; identification of major counterparties; a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged; and any other information that the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly require by
rule or order. Plans must analyze baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic condition impacts. Plans must demonstrate, in the event of material financial distress or failure of the covered company, a reorganization or liquidation of the
covered company under the federal bankruptcy code that could be accomplished within a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that the failure of the covered company would have serious adverse effects on
financial stability in the United States. Covered companies and their subsidiaries are subject to more stringent capital, leverage and liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations if they fail to file an acceptable plan
(i.e., the plan is determined to not be credible and deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner). Plans must be updated annually.      In January 2012, the FDIC adopted a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the FDIC a contingency plan for the resolution
of such institution in the event of its failure. The rule requires a covered depository institution to submit a resolution plan that should enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution s failure, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its
assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution s creditors.      The Company filed its
resolution plans pursuant to each rule in December 2015, and will periodically revise its plans as required.       Recovery
Plans  In December 2015, the OCC proposed a rule to establish enforceable guidelines for recovery planning by insured national banks, insured federal savings associations, and insured federal branches of foreign banks with average total
consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. U.S. Bank National Association would be a  covered bank  under this rule and would be required to develop and maintain a recovery plan. The proposed guidelines provide that a covered bank should
develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its individual risk profile, size, activities, and complexity, including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure. The proposed guidelines state that a recovery plan
should (a) establish triggers, which are quantitative or qualitative indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that should always be escalated to management or the board of directors, as appropriate, for purposes of initiating a
response; (b) identify a wide range of credible options that a covered bank could undertake to restore financial and operational strength and viability; and (c) address escalation procedures, management reports, and communication
procedures.       Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions  An FDIC-insured depository institution can be held liable
for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with another FDIC-insured institution   
         11   

under common control with that institution being  in default  or  in danger of default  (commonly referred to as  cross-guarantee  liability). An FDIC claim for
cross-guarantee liability against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against the depository institution.   
   Transactions with Affiliates  There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries
may borrow or otherwise obtain funding from U.S. Bank National Association. Under the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve, U.S. Bank National Association (and its subsidiaries) may only engage in lending and other
 covered transactions  with non-bank and non-savings bank affiliates to the following extent: (a) in the case of any single affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions may not exceed 10 percent of the capital stock and
surplus of U.S. Bank National Association; and (b) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions may not exceed 20 percent of the capital stock and surplus of U.S. Bank National Association.   
  Covered transactions between U.S. Bank National Association and its affiliates are also subject to certain collateralization
requirements. All covered transactions, including transactions with a third party in which an affiliate of U.S. Bank National Association has a financial interest, must be conducted on market terms.  Covered transactions  are defined to
include (a) a loan or extension of credit by a bank subsidiary to an affiliate; (b) a purchase of securities issued to a banking subsidiary by an affiliate; (c) a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve)
by the banking subsidiary from an affiliate; (d) the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate to the banking subsidiary as collateral for a loan; and (e) the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit by the banking
subsidiary on behalf of an affiliate. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the special treatment for transactions with financial subsidiaries and added derivative and securities lending transactions to the definition of  covered transactions. 
      Anti-Money Laundering and Suspicious Activity  The Company is subject to several federal laws that are designed to
combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies, or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities ( AML laws ). This category of laws includes the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control
Act, and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or USA PATRIOT Act.      In October 2015, U.S. Bank National Association entered into a Consent Order with the OCC regarding its Bank Secrecy Act/AML compliance program. U.S. Bank National Association has implemented a number of
Bank Secrecy Act/AML compliance program enhancements and is taking significant steps to remediate the issues identified in the Consent Order.      As implemented by federal banking and securities regulators and the Department of the Treasury, AML laws obligate depository institutions and broker/dealers to verify their customers  identity,
conduct customer due diligence, report on suspicious activity, file reports of transactions in currency, and conduct enhanced due diligence on certain accounts held by foreign banks and foreign persons. Depository institutions and broker/dealers are
required by their respective federal regulators to maintain policies and procedures in order to ensure compliance with the above obligations. Federal regulators regularly examine such policies and procedures to ensure their adequacy and
effectiveness, and the frequency and extent of such examinations and the remedial actions resulting therefrom have been increasing. Non-compliance with AML laws or failure to maintain adequate policies and procedures can lead to significant monetary
penalties and reputational damage, and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank merger, acquisition, restructuring, or other expansionary
activity. There have been a number of significant enforcement actions against banking organizations with respect to AML laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties, including criminal pleas.   
   Community Reinvestment Act  U.S. Bank National Association is subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA,
banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with safe and sound   
         12   

operation, to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including providing credit to individuals residing in low-income and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish
specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, and does not limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community in a manner
consistent with the CRA.      The OCC regularly assesses U.S. Bank National Association on its record in meeting the credit needs
of the community served by that institution, including low-income and moderate-income neighborhoods. The assessment also is considered when the Federal Reserve reviews applications by banking institutions to acquire, merge or consolidate with
another banking institution or its holding company, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an office. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company, the
Federal Reserve will assess the records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bank holding company, and those records may be the basis for denying the application.   
  U.S. Bank National Association received an  outstanding  CRA rating in its most recent examination, covering the period from
January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008.       Regulation of Brokerage, Investment Advisory and Insurance
Activities  The Company conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the United States through U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. ( USBII ) and other subsidiaries. These activities are subject to regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and other authorities, including state regulators. These regulations generally cover licensing of securities personnel, interactions with
customers, trading operations and periodic examinations.      Securities regulators impose capital requirements on USBII and
monitor its financial operations with periodic financial reviews. In addition, USBII is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.      The operations of the First American family of funds, the Company s proprietary money market fund complex, also are subject to regulation by the SEC. In July 2014, the SEC finalized rules regarding
money market fund reform. The final rules require a floating net asset value for institutional prime and tax-free money market funds. The rules also give the board of directors of the money market funds the ability to limit redemptions during
periods of stress (allowing for the use of liquidity fees and redemption gates during such times). Other changes include tightened diversification requirements and enhanced disclosure requirements.   
  The Company s operations in the areas of insurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit life insurance are subject to regulation and
supervision by various state insurance regulatory authorities, including the licensing of insurance brokers and agents.   
   Regulation of Derivatives and the Swaps Marketplace  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the
 CFTC ) has issued and will continue to issue additional rules regarding the regulation of the swaps marketplace and over-the-counter derivatives. The rules require swap dealers and major swap participants to register with the CFTC and
require them to meet robust business conduct standards to lower risk and promote market integrity, to meet certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements so that regulators can better monitor the markets, and to be subject to certain capital and
margin requirements. U.S. Bank National Association is a registered swap dealer.      In addition, in October 2015, the Federal
Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Farm Credit Administration finalized a rule concerning swap margin and capital requirements. The rule incorporates many aspects of the international framework for margin
requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives issued in September 2013 by the BCBS and the Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions. The final rule mandates the exchange of initial and variation margin for non-cleared
swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between swap entities regulated by the five agencies and certain   
         13   

counterparties. The amount of margin will vary based on the relative risk of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap. The final rule will phase in the variation margin
requirements between September 1, 2016, and March 1, 2017. The initial margin requirements will phase in over four years, beginning on September 1, 2016. Additionally, the agencies issued an interim final rule relating to the
rule s exemption from margin requirements for certain non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps used for hedging purposes by commercial end-users and certain other counterparties.   
  Other swaps requirements have been modified by legislation. Section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Act required covered U.S. banks acting as
dealers in commodity swaps, equity swaps and certain credit default swaps to  push out  such activities and conduct them through one or more non-bank affiliates. In December 2014, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act
of 2015 was signed into law, which contains a provision that narrows the push-out requirements in Section 716 only to  structured finance swaps.       Future regulations will likely impose additional operational and compliance costs, although the ultimate impact of regulations that have not yet been finalized remains unclear.   
   The Volcker Rule  In December 2013, the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued a final rule to implement the
so-called  Volcker Rule  under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading, and prohibits certain interests in, or relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds. The final
rule also requires annual attestation by a banking entity s Chief Executive Officer that the banking entity has in place processes to establish, maintain, enforce, review, test and modify a Compliance Program established in a manner reasonably
designed to achieve compliance with the final rule. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2014, and applies to the Company, U.S. Bank National Association and their affiliates.   
   Financial Privacy  Under the requirements imposed by the GLBA, the Company and its subsidiaries are required periodically to
disclose to their retail customers the Company s policies and practices with respect to the sharing of nonpublic customer information with its affiliates and others, and the confidentiality and security of that information. Under the GLBA,
retail customers also must be given the opportunity to  opt out  of information-sharing arrangements with non-affiliates, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the GLBA.   
   Incentive-Based Compensation Arrangements  In April 2011, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC, the National Credit
Union Administration and the Federal Housing Finance Agency issued a proposed rule under Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act that would require the reporting of incentive-based compensation arrangements by a covered financial institution, and
prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements at a covered financial institution that provide excessive compensation or that could expose the institution to inappropriate risks that could lead to material financial loss. The federal banking
agencies have indicated that a new incentive-based compensation rule will likely be issued under the Dodd-Frank Act in 2016.   
   Durbin Amendment  A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act known as the Durbin Amendment required the Federal Reserve to establish a cap
on the interchange fees that merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit transactions. The Federal Reserve issued final rules, effective October 1, 2011, for establishing standards, including a cap, for debit card interchange fees and
prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. The final rule established standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers were reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by
issuers for electronic debit transactions, and it established a maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction, which reduces fee revenue to debit card issuers such as the Company. Under the final
rule, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction, a 1 cent fraud prevention adjustment, and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction.
     In July 2013, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in  NACS, et al. v. Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System , invalidated these regulations, ruling in favor of a group of retailers   
         14   

who argued that the new lower interchange fees had been inappropriately set too high. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in March 2014, reversed the district
court, upheld the vast majority of the regulations, and remanded the matter to the district court for the limited purpose of reviewing the Federal Reserve s treatment of transaction monitoring costs. In January 2015, the Supreme Court declined
to review the Court of Appeals decision, which effectively keeps the final interchange fees rules intact.       Consumer
Protection Regulation  Retail banking activities are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by banks are subject to state usury laws and federal laws
concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to numerous laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:       

the federal Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z issued by the Federal Reserve, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;

the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C issued by the Federal Reserve, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the
public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;      

the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B issued by the Federal Reserve, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other
prohibited factors in extending credit;          

the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V issued by the Federal Reserve, governing the use and provision of information to consumer reporting
agencies;          

the Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;      

the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, applying to all debts incurred prior to commencement of active military service (including credit card and other
open-end debt) and limiting the amount of interest, including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges (other than bona fide insurance) that is related to the obligation or liability; and      

the guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such laws.      
  Deposit operations also are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations, such as:   

the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD issued by the Federal Reserve, which require disclosure of deposit terms to consumers;

Regulation CC issued by the Federal Reserve, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers;      

the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for
complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and          

the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit
accounts and customers  rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services, including remittance transfers.         The Company and its subsidiaries, as applicable, are also subject to state consumer lender regulation and various other state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers.   
   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Many of the foregoing laws and regulations are subject to change resulting from provisions in
the Dodd-Frank Act, which in many cases calls for revisions to implementing   
         15   

regulations. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the  CFPB ) created by the Dodd-Frank Act has assumed all authority to prescribe rules or issue orders or guidelines
pursuant to any federal consumer financial law. The CFPB regulates and examines the Company and its bank and other subsidiaries with respect to matters that relate to these laws and consumer financial services and products. The CFPB undertook
numerous rule-making and other initiatives in 2015, and will continue to do so in 2016. The CFPB s rulemaking, examination and enforcement authority has and will continue to significantly affect financial institutions involved in the provision
of consumer financial products and services, including the Company, U.S. Bank National Association and the Company s other subsidiaries. These regulatory activities may limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer,
which in turn may reduce the Company s revenues.      A number of significant rules that impact many aspects of the lifecycle
of a residential mortgage became effective in 2014. These rules implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act
( RESPA ). The final rules require banks to, among other things: (a) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new  ability to repay  requirement and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a
 qualified mortgage  (b) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for
loans secured by a borrower s principal residence; and (c) comply with additional rules and restrictions regarding mortgage loan originator compensation and the qualification and registration or licensing of loan originators. In 2015,
additional rulemaking introduced new residential mortgage disclosures to implement Dodd-Frank amendments to TILA and RESPA. The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosures, referred to by the CFPB as  Know Before You Owe,  replaced existing mortgage
disclosures with the new  Loan Estimate  and  Closing Disclosure  and introduced new timing requirements for providing these disclosures. Additional rulemaking affecting the residential mortgage business is expected in 2016.
     The CFPB and other federal agencies have also jointly finalized rules imposing credit risk retention requirements on lenders
originating certain mortgage loans, which require sponsors of a securitization to retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk of assets collateralizing asset-backed securities. Residential mortgage-backed securities qualifying as  qualified
residential mortgages  will be exempt from the risk retention requirements. The final rule maintains revisions to the proposed rules that cover degrees of flexibility for meeting risk retention requirements and the relationship between
 qualified mortgages  and  qualified residential mortgages.  These rules and any other new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB could require changes to the Company s mortgage origination and servicing businesses,
result in increased compliance costs and affect the streams of revenue of such businesses.       Supervisory Ratings  Federal
banking regulators regularly examine the Company to evaluate its financial condition and monitor its compliance with laws and regulatory policies. Key products of such exams are supervisory ratings of the Company s overall condition, commonly
referred to as the CAMELS rating for U.S. Bank National Association (which reflects the OCC s evaluation of certain components of the bank s condition) and the RFI/C(D) rating for U.S. Bancorp (which reflects the Federal Reserve s
evaluation of certain components of the holding company s condition). Violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management practices may be incorporated into these supervisory ratings. A downgrade in these ratings could
limit the Company s ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities for a period of time, require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities or investments, affect U.S.
Bank National Association s deposit insurance assessment rate, and impose additional recordkeeping and corporate governance requirements, as well as generally increase regulatory scrutiny of the Company.   
   Other Supervision and Regulation  The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), both as administered by the SEC, by virtue of the Company s status as a public company. As a listed company on the New York Stock Exchange
(the  NYSE ), the Company is subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies.

   Equity Compensation Plan Information       The following table summarizes information regarding the Company s equity compensation plans in effect as of December 31, 2015:   

(1)   
   Includes shares underlying stock options, performance-based restricted stock units (awarded to the members of the Company s managing committee and settled in
shares of the Company s common stock on a one-for-one basis) and restricted stock units (settled in shares of the Company s common stock on a one-for-one basis) under the U.S. Bancorp 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ),
the U.S. Bancorp Amended and Restated 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2007 Plan ) and the U.S. Bancorp 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. Includes an aggregate upward adjustment of 21,080 units subsequent to December 31, 2015 made to
performance-based restricted stock units granted in 2015, to reflect the difference between (a) the number of units earned based on actual 2015 Company performance compared to absolute and relative targets set forth in each recipient s award
agreement and (b) the target number of units granted to managing committee members in February 2015.      
   Excludes 137,620 shares, with a weighted-average exercise price of $19.86, underlying outstanding warrants assumed in connection with
acquisitions by the Company. In addition, the table does not include 1,285,974 unvested shares of restricted stock awarded under the 2007 Plan. These unvested shares were issued when awarded and consequently are included in the number of common
shares outstanding.        

(2)   
   The 46,704,629 shares available for future issuance are reserved under the 2015 Plan. Future awards under the 2015 Plan may be made in the form of stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, dividend equivalents, stock awards, or other stock-based awards.      

(3)   
   These shares of common stock are issuable pursuant to various current and former deferred compensation plans of U.S. Bancorp and its predecessor entities. No
exercise price is paid when shares are issued pursuant to the deferred compensation plans.          The deferred
compensation plans allow non-employee directors and members of senior management to defer all or part of their compensation until the earlier of retirement or termination of employment. The deferred compensation is deemed to be invested in one of
several investment alternatives at the option of the participant, including shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock. Deferred compensation deemed to be invested in U.S. Bancorp common stock will be received in the form of shares of U.S. Bancorp common
stock at the time of distribution, unless the Company chooses cash payment.        The 793,376 shares included in the table
assume that participants in the plans whose deferred compensation had been deemed to be invested in U.S. Bancorp common stock had elected to receive all of that deferred compensation in shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock on December 31, 2015.
The U.S. Bank Executive        Employees Deferred Compensation Plan (2005 Statement) and the U.S. Bank Outside Directors
Deferred Compensation Plan (2005 Statement) are the Company s only deferred compensation plans under which compensation may currently be deferred.

and privileges necessary or convenient to carry out all those acts and activities in which it may lawfully engage.     FOURTH : The

or exchange.    (f) The extent, if any, to which the holders of the shares of the series shall be entitled to vote with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise.    (g) The restrictions, if any on the issue or reissue of any additional preferred stock.  
 (h) The rights of the holders of the shares of the series upon the dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the corporation.  
 Subject to the prior or equal rights, if any, of the preferred stock of any and all series stated and expressed by the board of directors in
the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such preferred stock, the holders of common stock shall be entitled (i) to receive dividends when and as declared by the board of directors out of any funds legally available
therefore, (ii) in the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the corporation, to receive the remaining assets of the corporation, ratably according to the number of shares of common stock held, and (iii) to one vote for

designated, each such series consisting of such number of shares, with such voting powers and with such designations, preferences and relative, participating,  
      2  

optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as are stated and expressed in the exhibit with respect to such series attached hereto as specified below

Exhibit E 
 Series G Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock        

Exhibit F 
 Series H Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock       FIFTH : In furtherance and not in
limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized:    (a) To fix, determine and vary from time
to time the amount to be maintained as surplus and the amount or amounts to be set apart as working capital.    (b) To adopt, amend, alter
or repeal by-laws of the corporation, without any action on the part of the shareholders. The by-laws adopted by the directors may be amended, altered, changed, added to or repealed by the shareholders.  
 (c) To authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens, without limit as to amount, upon the real and personal property of this
corporation.    (d) To sell, assign, convey or otherwise dispose of a part of the property, assets and effects of this corporation, less

substantially the whole of the property, assets, effects, franchises and good will of this corporation on such terms and conditions as they shall deem advisable, but only pursuant to the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in amount of the
stock then having voting power and at the time issued and outstanding, but in any event not less than the amount required by law.    (e) All
of the powers of this corporation, insofar as the same lawfully may be vested by this certificate in the board of directors, are hereby conferred upon the board of directors of this corporation.  
  SIXTH : The affairs of the Corporation shall be conducted by a Board of Directors. Except as otherwise provided by this Article Sixth,
the number of directors, not less than twelve (12) nor more than thirty (30), shall be fixed from time to time by the Bylaws. Commencing with the 2008 annual meeting of the stockholders, directors shall be elected annually for terms of one year
and shall hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting. Directors elected at  
      3  

the 2005 annual meeting of stockholders shall hold office until the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders; directors elected at the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders shall hold office until the
2009 annual meeting of stockholders and directors elected at the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders shall hold office until the 2010 annual meeting of stockholders. In all cases, directors shall hold office until their respective successors are
elected by the stockholders and have qualified.    In the event that the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation having a
preference as to dividends or upon liquidation of the Corporation shall be entitled, by a separate class vote, to elect directors as may be specified pursuant to Article Fourth, then the provisions of such class or series of stock with respect to
their rights shall apply. The number of directors that may be elected by the holders of any such class or series of stock shall be in addition to the number fixed pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Article Sixth. Except as otherwise
expressly provided pursuant to Article Fourth, the number of directors that may be so elected by the holders of any such class or series of stock shall be elected for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and vacancies among
directors so elected by the separate class vote of any such class or series of stock shall be filled by the remaining directors elected by such class or series, or, if there are no such remaining directors, by the holders of such class or series in
the same manner in which such class or series initially elected a director.    If at any meeting for the election of directors, more than
one class of stock, voting separately as classes, shall be entitled to elect one or more directors and there shall be a quorum of only one such class of stock, that class of stock shall be entitled to elect its quota of directors notwithstanding the
absence of a quorum of the other class or classes of stock.    Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the
number of directors, subject to the provision of Article Fourth, shall be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and such directors so chosen shall hold office until the
next election of directors, and until their successors shall be elected and shall have qualified.     SEVENTH : No action required to
be taken or which may be taken at any annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, and the power of stockholders to consent in writing, without a meeting, to the taking of any action is specifically denied.  
  EIGHTH : No director of the corporation shall be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty by such director as a director; provided, however, that this Article Eighth shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director to the extent provided by applicable law (i) for any breach of the director s
duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this Article Eighth shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of
the corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.     Section 2. Number of Shares . The number of authorized shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be 20,010. Such number may from time to time be increased (but not in excess of the total number of authorized shares of preferred stock) or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
then outstanding) by further resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and by the filing of a certificate pursuant to the
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware stating that such increase or reduction, as the case may be, has been so authorized. The Corporation shall have the authority to issue fractional shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
    Section 3. Definitions . As used herein with respect to Series A Preferred Stock:  
   Business Day   means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday on which banking institutions in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, New York, New York or Wilmington, Delaware are not authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close.  
   Depositary Company   shall have the meaning set forth in Section 6(d) hereof.  
   Dividend Payment Date   shall have the meaning set forth in Section 4(a) hereof.  
   Dividend Period   shall have the meaning set forth in Section 4(a) hereof.  
   DTC   means The Depository Trust Company, together with its successors and assigns.  
   Junior Stock   means the Corporation s common stock and any other class or series of stock of the Corporation hereafter
authorized over which Series A Preferred Stock has preference or priority in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.  
   London Banking Day   means any day on which commercial banks are open for general business (including dealings in deposits in
U.S. dollars) in London, England.  
      A-1  

Parity Stock   means any other class or series of stock of the Corporation that
ranks on a par with Series A Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.  
   Preferred Director   shall have the meaning set forth in Section 7 hereof.  
   Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page   means the display designated on the Reuters 3000 Xtra (or such other page as may replace
that page on that service or such other service as may be nominated by the British Bankers  Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits).  
   Series A Preferred Stock   shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1 hereof.  
  Stock Purchase Date   means the first to occur of any January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, or if
any such day is not a Business Day, the next Business Day, after the Remarketing Settlement Date or the Remarketing Date of a Failed Remarketing, as such terms are defined in that certain Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 17,
2006, between the Corporation and Wilmington Trust Company, as successor indenture trustee, amending and supplementing that certain Junior Subordinated Indenture dated as of August 28, 2005, between the Company and Delaware Trust Company,
National Association, as thereby amended from time to time.      Three-Month LIBOR   means, with respect to any Dividend
Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage  per annum ) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period, as that rate appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page as of 11:00 a.m. (London
time) on the second London Banking Day preceding the first day of that Dividend Period. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, Three-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for
a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by
the Corporation, at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time on the second London Banking Day preceding the first day of that Dividend Period. U.S. Bank National Association, or such other bank as may be acting as calculation agent for the Corporation,
will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if
necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of the
rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the calculation agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that Dividend Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month
period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000. However, if the banks selected by the calculation agent to provide quotations are not quoting as described above, Three-Month LIBOR for
that Dividend Period will be the same as Three-Month LIBOR as determined for the previous Dividend Period, or in the case of the first Dividend Period, the most recent rate that could have been determined in accordance with the first sentence of
this paragraph had Series A Preferred Stock been outstanding. The calculation agent s establishment of Three-Month  
      A-2  

LIBOR and calculation of the amount of dividends for each Dividend Period will be on file at the principal offices of the Corporation, will be made available to any holder of Series A Preferred
Stock upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.     Section 4. Dividends.   
  (a) Rate . Holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation , but only out of assets legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $100,000 per share of Series A Preferred
Stock, and no more, payable on the following dates: (1) if the Series A Preferred Stock is issued prior to April 15, 2011, semi-annually in arrears on each April 15 and October 15 through April 15, 2011, and (2) from
and including the later of April 15, 2011 and the Stock Purchase Date, quarterly in arrears on each July 15, October 15, January 15 and April 15;  provided ,  however , if any such day is not a Business
Day, then payment of any dividend otherwise payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay) (each such day on which dividends are payable a
  Dividend Payment Date  ). The period from and including the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock or any Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date is a   Dividend Period . 
Dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock will accrue on the liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (i) from the date of issuance to but not including the later of the Dividend Payment Date in April 2011 and the Stock Purchase
Date at a rate  per annum  equal to 7.189%, and (ii) thereafter for each related Dividend Period at a rate  per annum  equal to the greater of (x) Three-Month LIBOR plus 1.02% or (y) 3.50%.The record date for payment of
dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be the last Business Day of the calendar month immediately preceding the month during which the Dividend Payment Date falls. The amount of dividends payable for any period prior to the later of the
Dividend Payment Day in April 2011 and the date of original issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and dividends for periods thereafter shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.     (b) Non-Cumulative Dividends . Dividends on shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be non-cumulative. To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid
dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after
the Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend Period or interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series A Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other
class or series of authorized preferred stock of the Corporation.     (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series A
Preferred Stock remains outstanding, (i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior
Stock, (ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly  
      A-3  

(other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and
other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation
and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than pursuant to  pro rata  offers to purchase all, or a  pro rata  portion, of the Series A
Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock, in each case unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid in full or
declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside. The foregoing shall not restrict the ability of the Corporation, or any affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in the Junior Stock or Parity Stock in
the ordinary course of business. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a
proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share on Series A Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any
accumulations on Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series A Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. If the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines not to pay any
dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide, or cause to be provided, written notice to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock prior to such date. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such
dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to
time out of any assets legally available therefor, and the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Parity Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.  
  Section 5. Liquidation Rights.   
  (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation,
holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled, out of assets legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to
the rights of the holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Series A Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Corporation s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating
distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $100,000 per share, plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends for the then-current Dividend Period to the date of liquidation. The holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be
entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.  
  (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any authorized,
declared and unpaid dividends to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be  pro rata  in accordance
with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends of Series A Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock.  
      A-4  

(c) Residual Distributions . If the liquidation preference plus any authorized, declared
and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective
rights and preferences.     (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the
sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business
combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
  Section 6. Redemption.   
  (a) Optional Redemption . So long as full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend
Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside, the Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, may redeem in whole or
in part the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at any time on or after the later of the Dividend Payment Date in April 2011 and the date of original issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, upon notice given as provided in
Section 6(b) below. The redemption price for shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be $100,000 per share plus dividends that have been declared but not paid plus accrued and unpaid dividends for the then-current Dividend Period to the
redemption date.     (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be mailed by
first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60
days before the date fixed for redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series A Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC. Any notice mailed as provided in
this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed by such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or
places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.

(c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata  from the holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Series A Preferred Stock
held by such holders or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of
this Section 6, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.     (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given
and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all assets necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the
shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of
Directors (the   Depositary Company  ) in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been
surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all rights with respect
to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date from the
funds so deposited, without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any
such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the
holders of record of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the
Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.     Section 7. Voting Rights . The holders of Series A Preferred
Stock will have no voting rights and will not be entitled to elect any directors, except as expressly provided by law and except that:  
  (a) Supermajority Voting Rights Amendments . Unless the vote or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be
required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, shall be required to authorize any amendment of the
Certificate of Incorporation or of any certificate amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto (including any certificate of designations or any similar document relating to any series of preferred stock) which will materially and adversely affect
the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series A Preferred Stock
 
      A-6  

or authorized preferred stock of the Corporation or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and/or
junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be
deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series A Preferred Stock.     (b) Supermajority Voting
Rights Priority . Unless the vote or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
and all other Parity Stock, at the time outstanding, voting as a single class without regard to series, shall be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into
or evidencing the right to purchase, any additional class or series of stock ranking prior to the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation.     (c) Special Voting Right .  
  (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred
stock that ranks on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(c) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate
amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the Series
A Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of
directors if such default in dividends did not exist), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders of common stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly
created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the election of such directors must not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or
other exchange on which the Corporation s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at no time include more than two
such directors. Each such director elected by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends is a
  Preferred Director  .     (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Directors will take place at
any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and any other class or series of the Corporation s stock that ranks on parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for
which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(c)(i) above, the secretary of the  
      A-7  

Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock (addressed to the secretary at the Corporation s principal office) must (unless such request is
received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid for the election of the two directors to be elected by
them as provided in Section 7(c)(iii) below. The Preferred Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.  
  (iii) Notice for Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the
Corporation s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Corporation does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Series A Preferred Stock may (at the
Corporation s expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(c)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Corporation. The Preferred Directors elected at any such special meeting will
hold office until the next annual meeting of the Corporation s stockholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(c)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director occurs (other than
prior to the initial election of the Preferred Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
(together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such
default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.     (iv) Termination;
Removal . Whenever full dividends have been paid regularly on the Series A Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, for at least four
consecutive Dividend Periods, then the right of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to elect such additional two directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any
similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred Directors will immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the Corporation s board of directors will be reduced
accordingly. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized
preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described
in this Section 7(c).     Section 8. Conversion.  The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to
convert such Series A Preferred Stock into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation.  
      A-8  

Section 9. Rank . Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, without the vote of the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or, subject to the voting rights granted in Section 7(b), any class of securities ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon
any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.     Section 10.
Repurchase . Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series A Preferred Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly
authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine;  provided ,  however , that the Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the
Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.     Section 11. Unissued or Reacquired Shares . Shares of Series
A Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and converted, redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to
series.     Section 12. No Sinking Fund.  Shares of series a preferred stock are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund.

dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.     Section 2. Number of Shares . The number of authorized shares of
Series B Preferred Stock shall be 40,000. Such number may from time to time be increased (but not in excess of the total number of authorized shares of preferred stock) or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock

provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware stating that such increase or reduction, as the case may be, has been so authorized. The Corporation shall have the authority to issue fractional shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
    Section 3. Definitions . As used herein with respect to Series B Preferred Stock:

meaning set forth in Section 6(d) hereof.      Dividend Payment Date   shall have the meaning set forth in
Section 4(a) hereof.      Dividend Period   shall have the meaning set forth in Section 4(a) hereof.

   Preferred Director   shall have the meaning set forth in Section 7 hereof.  
   Series B Preferred Stock   shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1 hereof.  
   Telerate Page 3750   means the display page so designated on the Moneyline/Telerate Service (or such other page as may
replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor, for the purpose of displaying rates or prices comparable to the London Interbank Offered Rate for U.S. dollar deposits).  
   Three-Month LIBOR   means, with respect to any Dividend Period, the offered rate (expressed as a percentage  per annum )

Dividend Period. If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, Three-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in
a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Corporation, at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time on the second London
Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of that Dividend Period. U.S. Bank National Association, or such other bank as may be acting as calculation agent for the Corporation, will request the principal London office of each of such banks to
provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of such quotations. If fewer
than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the
Corporation, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that Dividend Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in a
principal amount of not less than $1,000,000. However, if fewer than three banks selected by the Corporation to provide quotations are not quoting as described above, Three-Month LIBOR for that Dividend Period will be the same as Three-Month LIBOR
as determined for the previous Dividend Period, or in the case of the first Dividend Period, the most recent rate that could have been determined in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph had Series B Preferred Stock been outstanding.
The calculation agent s establishment of Three-Month LIBOR and calculation of the amount of dividends for each Dividend Period will be on file at the principal offices of the Corporation, will be made available to any holder of Series B
Preferred Stock upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.  
      B-2  

Section 4. Dividends.   
  (a) Rate . Holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, but only out of assets legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share of Series B Preferred
Stock, and no more, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15;  provided ,  however , if any such day is not a Business Day, then payment of any dividend otherwise
payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay) (each such day on which dividends are payable a   Dividend Payment Date  ). The
period from and including the date of issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock or any Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date is a   Dividend Period .  Dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock
will accrue on the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share at a rate  per annum  equal to the greater of (i) Three-Month LIBOR plus 0.60%% or (ii) 3.50%. The record date for payment of dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock
shall be the last Business Day of the calendar month immediately preceding the month during which the Dividend Payment Date falls. The amount of dividends payable shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days
elapsed.     (b) Non-Cumulative Dividends . Dividends on shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be non-cumulative. To the extent that
any dividends payable on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to accrue and
be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after the Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend Period or
interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series B Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other class or series of authorized preferred stock of the
Corporation.     (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding, (i) no dividend
shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock, (ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be
repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior
Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the
redemption of any such securities by the Corporation and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than pursuant to  pro rata  offers to purchase
all, or a  pro rata  portion, of the Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock, in each case unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock for the
then-current Dividend Period have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon
shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period
per share on Series B Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations on Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in  
      B-3  

respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series B Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. If the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend on
a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide, or cause to be provided, written notice to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock prior to such date. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or
otherwise) as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any assets legally
available therefor, and the shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.  
  Section 5. Liquidation Rights.   
  (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation,
holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled, out of assets legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to
the rights of the holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Series B Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Corporation s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating
distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation. The holder of Series B Preferred Stock
shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.  
  (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any authorized,
declared and unpaid dividends to all holders of Series B Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be  pro rata  in accordance
with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends of Series B Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock.  
  (c) Residual Distributions . If the liquidation preference plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to
all holders of Series B Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.  
  (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or
transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of
the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any
other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
      B-4  

Section 6. Redemption.   
  (a) Optional Redemption . The Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, may redeem in whole or in part the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at any time on or after the Dividend Payment Date in April 2011, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b)
below. The redemption price for shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be $25,000 per share plus dividends that have been declared but not paid.  
  (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed
for redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series B Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC.   Any notice mailed as provided in this
Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares
of Series B Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed by such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where
the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.  
  (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata  from the holders of record of Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Series B Preferred Stock held by such holders or by lot or in such other
manner as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, the Committee or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.  
  (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the
notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to
be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors (the   Depositary Company  ) in trust
for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all
shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect  
      B-5  

to such shares shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of
the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to
time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption
date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of record of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of
the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.  
  Section 7. Voting Rights . The holders of Series B Preferred Stock will have no voting rights and will not be entitled to elect any
directors, except as expressly provided by law and except that:     (a) Supermajority Voting Rights Amendments . Unless the vote
or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares the Series B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately as
a class, shall be required to authorize any amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation or of any certificate amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto (including any certificate of designation or any similar document relating to any series of
preferred stock) which will materially and adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series B Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series B
Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock of the Corporation or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Series B Preferred Stock
with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the powers,
preferences, privileges or rights of the Series B Preferred Stock.     (b) Supermajority Voting Rights Priority . Unless the vote
or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock, at the time
outstanding, voting as a single class without regard to series, shall be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase, any
additional class or series of stock ranking prior to the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation;

(c) Special Voting Right .  
  (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred
stock that ranks on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(c) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate
amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the Series
B Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of
directors if such default in dividends did not exist), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders of common stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly
created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the election of such directors must not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or
other exchange on which the Corporation s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at no time include more than two
such directors. Each such director elected by the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends is a
  Preferred Director  .     (ii) Election .   The election of the Preferred Directors will take

that provided in the Corporation s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Corporation does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Series B Preferred
Stock may (at our expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(c)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Corporation. The Preferred Directors elected at any such special meeting will
hold office  
      B-7  

until the next annual meeting of our stockholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(c)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred
Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the holders of the
Series B Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the
election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.  
  (iv) Termination; Removal . Whenever full dividends have been paid regularly on the Series B Preferred Stock and any
other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series B Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, for at least four Dividend Periods, then the right of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock to elect such additional
two directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred
Directors will immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be
entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(c).

of the Series B Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or, subject to the voting rights granted in Section 7(b), any class of securities ranking senior to the Series B Preferred Stock as to
dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
  Section 10. Repurchase . Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series B Preferred Stock
from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine;  provided ,  however , that the

Section 4. Dividends.   
  (a) Rate . Holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, but only out of assets legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $100,000 per share of Series C Preferred
Stock, and no more, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15;  provided ,  however , if any such day is not a Business Day, then payment of any dividend otherwise payable on
that date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay) (each such day on which dividends are payable a   Dividend Payment Date  ). The period from and
including the date of issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock or any Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date is a   Dividend Period .  Dividends on each share of Series C Preferred Stock will accrue on
the liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (i) to but not including the Dividend Payment Date in January 2012 at a rate  per annum  equal to 6.091%, and (ii) thereafter for each related Dividend Period at a rate  per annum 
equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus 1.147%.     (b) Non-Cumulative Dividends . Dividends on shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
non-cumulative. To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not
cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after the Dividend Payment
Date for such Dividend Period or interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series C Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other class or series of
authorized preferred stock of the Corporation.     (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series C Preferred Stock remains
outstanding, (i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock, (ii) no
shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into Junior Stock, or the exchange or
conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid to or made
available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than pursuant to
 pro rata  offers to purchase all, or a  pro rata  portion, of the Series C Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock, in each case unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of
Series C Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and any Parity
Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series C Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for
the then-current Dividend Period per share on Series C Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations on Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series C
Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. If the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend  
      C-3  

on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide, or cause to be provided, written notice to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock prior to such date. Subject to the foregoing, and
not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be declared and paid on any
Junior Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available therefor, and the shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.  
  Section 5. Liquidation Rights.   
  (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation,
holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled, out of assets legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to
the rights of the holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Series C Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Corporation s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating
distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $100,000 per share, plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation. The holder of Series C Preferred Stock
shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.  
  (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any authorized,
declared and unpaid dividends to all holders of Series C Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be  pro rata  in accordance
with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends of Series C Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock.  
  (c) Residual Distributions . If the liquidation preference plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to
all holders of Series C Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.  
  (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or
transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of
the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any
other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
      C-4  

Section 6. Redemption.   
  (a) Optional Redemption . The Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, may redeem in whole or in part the shares of Series C Preferred Stock at the time outstanding at any time upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below. The redemption price for shares of Series C Preferred
Stock shall be $100,000 per share plus dividends that have been declared but not paid.     (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every
redemption of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the
Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series C Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Corporation may give such
notice in any manner permitted by DTC.   Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by
mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series C Preferred
Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed
by such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to
accrue on the redemption date.     (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata  from the holders of record of Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Series C Preferred Stock held by such
holders or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this
Section 6, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series C Preferred
Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.     (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on
or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares
called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors
(the   Depositary Company  ) in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for
cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares
shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right  
      C-5  

of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The
Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and
unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of record of the shares so called for
redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any
interest.     Section 7. Voting Rights . The holders of Series C Preferred Stock will have no voting rights and will not be
entitled to elect any directors, except as expressly provided by law and except that:      

(a)  
  Special Voting Right .       (i) Voting Right . If and whenever
dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this
Section 7(a) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors constituting the
Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights , 
whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to series, to the
exclusion of the holders of common stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the election of such directors must not cause
the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Corporation s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and
further provided that the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock
that ranks on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends is a   Preferred Director  .  
  (ii) Election .   The election of the Preferred Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or
any special meeting of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and any other class or series of our stock that ranks on parity with Series C Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided
herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(a)(i) above, the secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series C Preferred Stock (addressed to the secretary at
 
      C-6  

the Corporation s principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event
such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series C Preferred
Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in Section 7(a)(iii) below. The Preferred Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per
director on any matter.     (iii) Notice for Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar
manner to that provided in the Corporation s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Corporation does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Series C
Preferred Stock may (at our expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(a)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Corporation. The Preferred Directors elected at any such special
meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(a)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director occurs (other than prior
to the initial election of the Preferred Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock (together
with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default
in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.     (iv) Termination; Removal .
Whenever full dividends have been paid regularly on the Series C Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series C Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, for three consecutive Dividend
Periods and full dividends have been paid or declared and set aside for payment for the fourth consecutive Dividend Period, then the right of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock to elect such additional two directors will cease (but subject
always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred Directors will immediately terminate and the
number of directors constituting our board of directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock
(together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such
default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(a).     Section 8.
Conversion.  The holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such Series C Preferred Stock into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation.  
      C-7  

Section 9. Rank . Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, without the vote of the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or, subject to the voting rights granted in Section 7(a), any class of securities ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends and the
distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
  Section 10. Repurchase . Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series C Preferred Stock
from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine;  provided ,  however , that the
Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.

Y, 12 CFR 225 (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor Appropriate Federal Banking Agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of Series F Preferred Stock is outstanding.  
   Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page   means the display designated on the Reuters 3000 Xtra (or such other page as may replace that
page on that service or such other service as may be nominated by the British Bankers  Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits).  
   Series F Preferred Stock   shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1 hereof.  
   Three-Month LIBOR   means, with respect to any Dividend Period beginning on or after January 15, 2022, the rate
(expressed as a percentage  per annum ) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period, as that rate appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the second
London Banking Day preceding the first day of that Dividend Period. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, Three-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month
period commencing on the first day of that Dividend  
      D-2  

Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the
Corporation, at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time), on the second London Banking Day preceding the first day of that Dividend Period. U.S. Bank National Association, or such other bank as may be acting as calculation agent for the Corporation,
will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if
necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of the
rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the calculation agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m. (New York City time), on the first day of that Dividend Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month
period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000. However, if the banks selected by the calculation agent to provide quotations are not quoting as described above, Three-Month LIBOR for
that Dividend Period will be the same as Three-Month LIBOR as determined for the previous Dividend Period, or in the case of the first Dividend Period beginning on or after January 15, 2022, the most recent rate that could have been determined
in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph had the dividend rate been a floating rate during the period prior to January 15, 2022. The calculation agent s establishment of Three-Month LIBOR and calculation of the amount of
dividends for each Dividend Period will be on file at the principal offices of the Corporation, will be made available to any holder of Series F Preferred Stock upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.  
  Section 4. Dividends.   
  (a) Rate . Holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, but only out of assets legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share of Series F Preferred
Stock, and no more, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 15, April 15, July 15 or October 15;  provided ,  however , if any such day is not a Business Day, then payment of any dividend otherwise
payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay) (each such day on which dividends are payable a   Dividend Payment Date  ). The
period from and including the date of issuance of the Series F Preferred Stock or any Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date is a   Dividend Period .  Dividends on each share of Series F Preferred Stock
will accrue on the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (i) from the date of issuance to but not including the Dividend Payment Date on January 15, 2022 at a rate  per annum  equal to 6.50%, and (ii) thereafter for each
related Dividend Period at a rate  per annum  equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus 4.468%. The record date for payment of dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock shall be the last Business Day of the calendar month immediately preceding the month
during which the Dividend Payment Date falls. The amount of dividends payable for any period prior to January 15, 2022 shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and dividends for periods thereafter
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock shall not be declared, paid or set aside for payment to the extent such act
would cause the Corporation to fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable thereto, including applicable capital adequacy guidelines.  
      D-3  

(b) Non-Cumulative Dividends . Dividends on shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall be
non-cumulative. To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series F Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not
cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after the Dividend Payment
Date for such Dividend Period or interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series F Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other class or series of
authorized preferred stock of the Corporation.     (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series F Preferred Stock remains
outstanding, (i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock, (ii) no
shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into Junior Stock, or the exchange or
conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid to or made
available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than pursuant to
 pro rata  offers to purchase all, or a  pro rata  portion, of the Series F Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock, in each case unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of
Series F Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series F Preferred Stock and any Parity
Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series F Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for
the then-current Dividend Period per share on Series F Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, on Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series F
Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. If the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide, or cause to be provided, written notice to the
holders of the Series F Preferred Stock prior to such date. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized
committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available therefor, and the shares of Series F Preferred Stock or Parity Stock shall not be entitled to
participate in any such dividend.  
      D-4  

Section 5. Liquidation Rights.   
  (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation,
holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall be entitled, out of assets legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to
the rights of the holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Series F Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Corporation s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating
distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation. The holder of Series F Preferred Stock
shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.  
  (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any authorized,
declared and unpaid dividends to all holders of Series F Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series F Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be  pro rata  in accordance
with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends of Series F Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock.  
  (c) Residual Distributions . If the liquidation preference plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to
all holders of Series F Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.  
  (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or
transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of
the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any
other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
  Section 6. Redemption.   
  (a) Optional Redemption . The Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, may redeem in whole or in part the shares of Series F Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at any time on or after the Dividend Payment Date in January, 2022, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b)
below. The redemption price for shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall be $25,000 per share plus dividends that have been declared but not paid (the   Redemption Price  ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, within 90 days following the
occurrence of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, the Corporation, at its option, subject to the approval of the Appropriate  
      D-5  

Federal Banking Agency, may redeem, at any time, all (but not less than all) of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, upon notice given as provided Subsection
(b) below, at the Redemption Price applicable on such date of redemption.     (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every
redemption of shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the
Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series F Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Corporation may give such
notice in any manner permitted by DTC.   Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by
mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series F Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series F Preferred
Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed
by such holder; (iii) the Redemption Price; (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to
accrue on the redemption date.     (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series F Preferred
Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata  from the holders of record of Series F Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Series F Preferred Stock held by such
holders or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this
Section 6, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series F Preferred
Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.     (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on
or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares
called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors
(the   Depositary Company  ) in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for
cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares
shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date from the funds so
deposited, without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary  
      D-6  

Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three
years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of record of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be
unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.  
  Section 7. Voting Rights . The holders of Series F Preferred Stock will have no voting rights and will not be entitled to elect any
directors, except as expressly provided by law and except that:     (a) Supermajority Voting Rights Amendments . Unless the vote
or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares of the Series F Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately
as a class, shall be required to authorize any amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation or of any certificate amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto (including any certificate of designations or any similar document relating to any series
of preferred stock) which will materially and adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series F Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series F
Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock of the Corporation or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Series F Preferred Stock
with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the powers,
preferences, privileges or rights of the Series F Preferred Stock.     (b) Supermajority Voting Rights Priority . Unless the vote
or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares of the Series F Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock, at the time
outstanding, voting as a single class without regard to series, shall be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase, any
additional class or series of stock ranking prior to the shares of the Series F Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation;  
  (c) Special Voting Right .  
  (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred
stock that ranks on parity with the Series F Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(c) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate
amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the
 
      D-7  

holders of the Series F Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the
holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders
of common stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the election of such directors must not cause the Corporation to
violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Corporation s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that
the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity
with the Series F Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends is a   Preferred Director  .     (ii)
Election .   The election of the Preferred Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the holders of Series F Preferred Stock and any other class or series of the Corporation s stock that
ranks on parity with Series F Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(c)(i) above, the
secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series F Preferred Stock (addressed to the secretary at the Corporation s principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date
fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series F Preferred Stock, and any other
class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series F Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in
Section 7(c)(iii) below. The Preferred Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.  
  (iii) Notice for Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the
Corporation s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Corporation does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Series F Preferred Stock may (at the
Corporation s expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(c)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Corporation. The Preferred Directors elected at any such special meeting will
hold office until the next annual meeting of the Corporation s stockholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(c)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director occurs (other than
prior to the initial election of the Preferred Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock
(together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such
default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.  
      D-8  

(iv) Termination; Removal . Whenever full dividends have been paid
regularly on the Series F Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series F Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods, then the right of the
holders of Series F Preferred Stock to elect such additional two directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future
Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred Directors will immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the Corporation s board of directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any
time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights , 
whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(c).  
  Section 8. Conversion . The holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such Series F Preferred Stock
into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation.     Section 9. Rank . Notwithstanding anything set forth in
the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, without the vote of the holders
of the Series F Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or, subject to the voting rights granted in Section 7(b), any class of securities ranking senior to the Series F Preferred Stock as to
dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
  Section 10. Repurchase . Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series F Preferred Stock
from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine;  provided ,  however , that the
Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.  
  Section 11. Unissued or Reacquired Shares . Shares of Series F Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and converted,
redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to series.  
  Section 12. No Sinking Fund . Shares of Series F Preferred Stock are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund.

Stock, and no more, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15;  provided ,  however , if any such day is not a Business Day, then payment of any dividend otherwise
payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay) (each such day on which dividends are payable a   Dividend Payment Date  ). The
period from and including the date of issuance of the Series G Preferred Stock or any Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date is a   Dividend Period .  Dividends on each share of Series G Preferred Stock
will accrue on the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (i) from the date of issuance to but not including the Dividend Payment Date on April 15, 2017 at a rate  per annum  equal to 6.00%, and (ii) thereafter for each
related Dividend Period at a rate  per annum  equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus 4.86125%. The record date for payment of dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock shall be the last Business Day of the calendar month immediately preceding the
month during which the Dividend Payment Date falls. The amount of dividends payable for any period prior to April 15, 2017 shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and dividends for periods thereafter
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock shall  
      E-3  

not be declared, paid or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable thereto, including applicable capital
adequacy guidelines.     (b) Non-Cumulative Dividends . Dividends on shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall be non-cumulative. To the
extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series G Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to
accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders of Series G Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after the Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend
Period or interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series G Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other class or series of authorized preferred
stock of the Corporation.     (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series G Preferred Stock remains outstanding,
(i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock, (ii) no shares of Junior
Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one
share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking
fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than pursuant to  pro rata  offers to
purchase all, or a  pro rata  portion, of the Series G Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock, in each case unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock for
the then-current Dividend Period have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series G Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared
upon shares of Series G Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend
Period per share on Series G Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, on Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series G Preferred Stock that may be
in arrears. If the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide, or cause to be provided, written notice to the holders of the Series G Preferred
Stock prior to such date. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of
the Corporation may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available therefor, and the shares of Series G Preferred Stock or Parity Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.  
      E-4  

Section 5. Liquidation Rights.   
  (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation,
holders of Series G Preferred Stock shall be entitled, out of assets legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to
the rights of the holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Series G Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Corporation s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating
distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation. The holder of Series G Preferred Stock
shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.  
  (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any authorized,
declared and unpaid dividends to all holders of Series G Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series G Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be  pro rata  in accordance
with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends of Series G Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock.  
  (c) Residual Distributions . If the liquidation preference plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to
all holders of Series G Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.  
  (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or
transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of
the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any
other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
  Section 6. Redemption.   
  (a) Optional Redemption . The Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, may redeem in whole or in part the shares of Series G Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at any time on or after the Dividend Payment Date in April, 2017, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below.
The redemption price for shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall be $25,000 per share plus dividends that have been declared but not paid (the   Redemption Price  ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, within 90 days following the
occurrence of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, the Corporation, at its option, subject to the approval of the Appropriate  
      E-5  

Federal Banking Agency, may provide notice of its intent to redeem as provided in Subsection (b) below, and subsequently redeem, all (but not less than all) of the shares of Series G
Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at the Redemption Price applicable on such date of redemption.     (b) Notice of Redemption .
Notice of every redemption of shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock
register of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series G Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the
Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC.   Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly
to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series G Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other
shares of Series G Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number
of such shares to be redeemed by such holder; (iii) the Redemption Price; (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and (v) that dividends on the shares
to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.     (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the
shares of Series G Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata  from the holders of record of Series G Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Series G
Preferred Stock held by such holders or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the
provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of
Series G Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.     (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been
duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the
holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of
the Board of Directors (the   Depositary Company  ) in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not
been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all rights with
respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date
from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary  
      E-6  

Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three
years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of record of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be
unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.  
  Section 7. Voting Rights . The holders of Series G Preferred Stock will have no voting rights and will not be entitled to elect any
directors, except as expressly provided by law and except that:     (a) Supermajority Voting Rights Amendments . Unless the vote
or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares of the Series G Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately
as a class, shall be required to authorize any amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation or of any certificate amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto (including any certificate of designations or any similar document relating to any series
of preferred stock) which will materially and adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series G Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series G
Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock of the Corporation or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Series G Preferred Stock
with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the powers,
preferences, privileges or rights of the Series G Preferred Stock.     (b) Supermajority Voting Rights Priority . Unless the vote
or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares of the Series G Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock, at the time
outstanding, voting as a single class without regard to series, shall be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase, any
additional class or series of stock ranking prior to the shares of the Series G Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation;  
  (c) Special Voting Right .  
  (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred
stock that ranks on parity with the Series G Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(c) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate
amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the
 
      E-7  

holders of the Series G Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the
holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders
of common stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the election of such directors must not cause the Corporation to
violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Corporation s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that
the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity
with the Series G Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends is a   Preferred Director  .     (ii)
Election .   The election of the Preferred Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the holders of Series G Preferred Stock and any other class or series of the Corporation s stock that
ranks on parity with Series G Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(c)(i) above, the
secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series G Preferred Stock (addressed to the secretary at the Corporation s principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date
fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series G Preferred Stock, and any other
class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series G Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in
Section 7(c)(iii) below. The Preferred Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.  
  (iii) Notice for Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the
Corporation s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Corporation does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Series G Preferred Stock may (at the
Corporation s expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(c)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Corporation. The Preferred Directors elected at any such special meeting will
hold office until the next annual meeting of the Corporation s stockholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(c)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director occurs (other than
prior to the initial election of the Preferred Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock
(together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such
default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.  
      E-8  

(iv) Termination; Removal . Whenever full dividends have been paid
regularly on the Series G Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series G Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods, then the right of the
holders of Series G Preferred Stock to elect such additional two directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future
Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred Directors will immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the Corporation s board of directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any
time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights , 
whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(c).  
  Section 8. Conversion.  The holders of Series G Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such Series G Preferred Stock
into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation.       Section 9. Rank . Notwithstanding anything set
forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, without the vote of the
holders of the Series G Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or, subject to the voting rights granted in Section 7(b), any class of securities ranking senior to the Series G Preferred Stock as
to dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
  Section 10. Repurchase . Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series G Preferred Stock
from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine;  provided ,  however , that the
Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.  
  Section 11. Unissued or Reacquired Shares . Shares of Series G Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and converted,
redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to series.

through DTC, the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC.   Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice,
but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series H Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption
of any other shares of Series H Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be
redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed by such holder; (iii) the Redemption Price; (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and (v) that
dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.     (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any
redemption of only part of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata  from the holders of record of Series H Preferred Stock in
proportion to the number of Series H Preferred Stock held by such holders or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine to
be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms
and conditions upon which shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.     (d) Effectiveness of Redemption .
If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the
 pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any
duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors (the   Depositary Company  ) in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so
called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after such
redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right  
      F-5  

of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The
Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and
unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of record of the shares so called for
redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any
interest.     Section 7. Voting Rights . The holders of Series H Preferred Stock will have no voting rights and will not be
entitled to elect any directors, except as expressly provided by law and except that:     (a) Supermajority Voting
Rights Amendments . Unless the vote or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares of the Series H Preferred
Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, shall be required to authorize any amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation or of any certificate amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto (including any certificate of designations
or any similar document relating to any series of preferred stock) which will materially and adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series H Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any increase in
the amount of the authorized or issued Series H Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock of the Corporation or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with
and/or junior to the Series H Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will
not be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series H Preferred Stock.     (b) Supermajority
Voting Rights Priority . Unless the vote or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares of the Series H Preferred
Stock and all other Parity Stock, at the time outstanding, voting as a single class without regard to series, shall be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible
into or evidencing the right to purchase, any additional class or series of stock ranking prior to the shares of the Series H Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation;     (c) Special Voting Right .  
  (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series H Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred
stock that ranks on parity with the Series H Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(c) have been conferred and are exercisable,
 
      F-6  

have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors constituting the Board
of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether
or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of
the holders of common stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at no time
include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the holders of shares of Series H Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series H Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends
is a   Preferred Director  .     (ii) Election .   The election of the Preferred Directors will take
place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the holders of Series H Preferred Stock and any other class or series of the Corporation s stock that ranks on parity with Series H Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends
and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(c)(i) above, the secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of
Series H Preferred Stock (addressed to the secretary at the Corporation s principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event
such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series H Preferred Stock, and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series H Preferred
Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in Section 7(c)(iii) below. The Preferred Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per
director on any matter.     (iii) Notice for Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar
manner to that provided in the Corporation s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Corporation does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Series H
Preferred Stock may (at the Corporation s expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(c)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Corporation. The Preferred Directors elected at any
such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the Corporation s stockholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(c)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred
Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the holders of the
Series H Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the
election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.  
      F-7  

(iv) Termination; Removal . Whenever full dividends have been paid
regularly on the Series H Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series H Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods, then the right of the
holders of Series H Preferred Stock to elect such additional two directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future
Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred Directors will immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the Corporation s board of directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any
time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights , 
whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(c).  
  Section 8. Conversion.  The holders of Series H Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such Series H Preferred Stock
into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation.     Section 9. Rank . Notwithstanding anything set forth in
the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, without the vote of the holders
of the Series H Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or, subject to the voting rights granted in Section 7(b), any class of securities ranking senior to the Series H Preferred Stock as to
dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
  Section 10. Repurchase . Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series H Preferred Stock
from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine;  provided ,  however , that the
Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.  
  Section 11. Unissued or Reacquired Shares . Shares of Series H Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and converted,
redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to series.  
  Section 12.   No   Sinking Fund  .    Shares of Series H Preferred Stock are not subject to the operation of a
sinking fund.    * * * * * *

a.m. (London time) on the second London Banking Day preceding the first day of that Dividend Period. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, Three-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in

for the Corporation, will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean
(rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest

for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000. However, if the banks selected by the calculation agent to provide quotations are not quoting as described above,
Three-Month LIBOR for that Dividend Period will be the same as Three-Month LIBOR as determined for the previous Dividend Period, or in the case of the first Dividend Period beginning on or after January 15, 2021, the most recent rate that could
have been determined in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph had the dividend rate been a floating rate during the period prior to January 15, 2021. The calculation agent s establishment of Three-Month LIBOR and calculation
of the amount of dividends for each Dividend Period will be on file at the principal offices of the Corporation, will be made available to any holder of Series I Preferred Stock upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest
error.     Section 4. Dividends .  
  (a) Rate . Holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, but only out of assets legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share of Series I Preferred
Stock, and no more, (i) from the date of issuance to, but excluding, January 15, 2021, at a rate  per annum  equal to 5.125%, payable semi-annually in arrears on each January 15 and July 15, commencing on January 15,
2016 through, and including, January 15, 2021, and (ii) from, and including, January 15, 2021, at a floating rate  per annum  equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus a spread of 3.486%, payable quarterly in arrears on each
January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2021;  provided ,  however , if any date on or prior to January 15, 2021 on which dividends otherwise would be payable is
 
      A-3  

not a Business Day, then payment of any dividend otherwise payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, without any interest or other payment in respect of
such delay, and if any date after January 15, 2021 on which dividends otherwise would be payable is not a Business Day, then payment of any dividend otherwise payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding Business Day unless that day
falls in the next calendar month, in which case payment of any dividend otherwise payable on that date will be the immediately preceding Business Day, and dividends will accrue to the actual payment date (each such day on which dividends are payable
a   Dividend Payment Date  ). The period from and including the date of issuance of the Series I Preferred Stock or any Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date is a   Dividend Period .  The
record date for payment of dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock shall be the last Business Day of the calendar month immediately preceding the month during which the Dividend Payment Date falls. The amount of dividends payable for any period
prior to January 15, 2021 shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and dividends for periods thereafter shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock shall not be declared, paid or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable
thereto, including applicable capital adequacy guidelines.     (b) Non-Cumulative Dividends . Dividends on shares of Series I
Preferred Stock shall be non-cumulative. To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series I Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid
dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after
the Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend Period or interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series I Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other
class or series of authorized preferred stock of the Corporation.     (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series I
Preferred Stock remains outstanding, (i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior
Stock, (ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into Junior Stock, or
the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid
to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than
pursuant to  pro rata  offers to purchase all, or a  pro rata  portion, of the Series I Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock, in each case unless full dividends on all outstanding
shares of Series I Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series I Preferred Stock and
any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series I Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued
dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share on Series I Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including  
      A-4  

any accumulations, on Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series I Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. If the Board
of Directors of the Corporation determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide, or cause to be provided, written notice to the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock prior to such
date. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be
declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available therefor, and the shares of Series I Preferred Stock or Parity Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.  
  Section 5. Liquidation Rights .  
  (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation,
holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall be entitled, out of assets legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to
the rights of the holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Series I Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Corporation s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating
distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation. The holder of Series I Preferred Stock
shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.  
  (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any
authorized, declared and unpaid dividends to all holders of Series I Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series I Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be  pro rata  in
accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends of Series I Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock.  
  (c) Residual Distributions . If the liquidation preference plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to
all holders of Series I Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.  
  (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or
transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of
the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any
other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
      A-5  

Section 6. Redemption .  
  (a) Optional Redemption . The Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, may redeem in whole or in part the shares of Series I Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at any time on or after January 15, 2021, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below. The redemption
price for shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall be $25,000 per share plus dividends that have been declared but not paid (the   Redemption Price  ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, within 90 days following the occurrence of a
Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, the Corporation, at its option, subject to the approval of the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, may provide notice of its intent to redeem as provided in Section 6(b) below, and subsequently redeem, all
(but not less than all) of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at the Redemption Price applicable on such date of redemption.  
  (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date
fixed for redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series I Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC.   Any notice mailed as provided in this
Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares
of Series I Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series I Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of
shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed by such holder; (iii) the Redemption Price; (iv) the place or places where
the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.  
  (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the
shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata  from the holders of record of Series I Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Series I Preferred Stock held by such holders or by lot or in such other
manner as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, the Committee or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.  
  (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the
notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to
be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company  
      A-6  

selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors (the   Depositary Company  ) in trust for the  pro rata 
benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for
redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only
the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from
time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the
redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of record of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured
creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.  
  Section 7. Voting Rights . The holders of Series I Preferred Stock will have no voting rights and will not be entitled to elect any
directors, except as expressly provided by law and except that:     (a) Supermajority Voting Rights Amendments . Unless the vote
or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares of the Series I Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately
as a class, shall be required to authorize any amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation or of any certificate amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto (including any certificate of designations or any similar document relating to any series
of preferred stock) which will materially and adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series I Preferred Stock, taken as a whole;  provided, however , that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued
Series I Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock of the Corporation or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Series I
Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely
affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series I Preferred Stock.     (b) Supermajority Voting
Rights Priority . Unless the vote or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all of the shares of the Series I Preferred Stock
and all other Parity Stock, at the time outstanding, voting as a single class without regard to series, shall be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into
or evidencing the right to purchase, any additional class or series of stock ranking prior to the shares of the Series I Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation.  
      A-7  

(c) Special Voting Right .  
  (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred
stock that ranks on parity with the Series I Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(c) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate
amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the Series
I Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of
directors if such default in dividends did not exist), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders of common stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly
created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships),  provided  that the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the holders of
shares of Series I Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series I Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends is a   Preferred Director  .  
  (ii) Election .   The election of the Preferred Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or
any special meeting of the holders of Series I Preferred Stock and any other class or series of the Corporation s stock that ranks on parity with Series I Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid,
called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(c)(i) above, the secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series I Preferred Stock (addressed to the
secretary at the Corporation s principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next
annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series I Preferred Stock, and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series I Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for
which dividends have not been paid, for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in Section 7(c)(iii) below. The Preferred Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.  
  (iii) Notice for Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in
the Corporation s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Corporation does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of Series I Preferred Stock may (at the
Corporation s expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(c)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Corporation. The Preferred Directors elected at any such special meeting will
hold office until the next annual meeting of the Corporation s stockholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(c)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director occurs (other than
prior to the  
      A-8  

initial election of the Preferred Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the
holders of the Series I Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to
vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.  
  (iv) Termination; Removal . Whenever full dividends have been paid regularly on the Series I Preferred Stock and any
other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series I Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods, then the right of the holders of Series I Preferred Stock to elect such
additional two directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the
Preferred Directors will immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the Corporation s board of directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights ,  whether or not the holders of such preferred
stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(c).  
  Section 8. Conversion . The holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such Series I Preferred Stock
into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation.     Section 9. Rank . Notwithstanding anything set forth in
the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Committee or any authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, without the vote of the holders
of the Series I Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or, subject to the voting rights granted in Section 7(b), any class of securities ranking senior to the Series I Preferred Stock as to
dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.  
  Section 10. Repurchase . Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series I Preferred Stock
from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine;  provided ,  however , that the
Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.  
      A-9  

Section 11. Unissued or Reacquired Shares . Shares of Series I Preferred Stock not
issued or which have been issued and converted, redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to series.  
  Section 12. No Sinking Fund . Shares of Series I Preferred Stock are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION APPEARS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995:   
 This report contains forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and
expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date hereof. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future
revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. A
reversal or slowing of the current economic recovery or another severe contraction could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp s revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets could experience a recurrence of
significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions and lead to a tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Stress in the commercial real estate
markets, as well as a downturn in the residential real estate markets could cause credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, U.S. Bancorp s business and financial performance is likely to be negatively impacted by
recently enacted and future legislation and regulation. U.S. Bancorp s results could also be adversely affected by deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of
its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of securities held in its investment securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; litigation; increased competition from both banks
and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; breaches in data security; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management s ability to effectively
manage credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and reputational risk.    Additional factors
could cause actual results to differ from expectations, including the risks discussed in the  Corporate Risk Profile  section on pages 42 67 and the  Risk Factors  section on pages 156  166 of this report. However,
factors other than these also could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp s results, and the reader should not consider these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the
date hereof, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.

Management s Discussion and Analysis
       
   OVERVIEW     U.S. Bancorp and its
subsidiaries (the  Company ) delivered record financial performance in 2015, which was a year characterized by persistent and historically low interest rates, modest economic growth, and increasing regulatory requirements. In 2015, the
Company effectively balanced decisions on operating efficiencies with opportunities for investing in future growth and addressing its customers  needs. These actions resulted in delivering record full-year net income and diluted earnings per
share.    The Company earned $5.9 billion in 2015, an increase of 0.5 percent over 2014, principally due to higher net interest income, a
lower provision for credit losses and prudent management of expenses. Net interest income was higher than the prior year as a result of an increase in average earning assets and continued growth in lower cost deposit funding, partially offset by a
decrease in the net interest margin. The Company s loan portfolio credit quality continued to improve throughout the year, as reflected by the decreases in net charge-offs and nonperforming assets. The Company s continued focus on
controlling expenses allowed it to achieve an industry-leading efficiency ratio of 53.8 percent in 2015. In addition, the Company s return on average assets and return on common equity were 1.44 percent and 14.0 percent, respectively, the
highest among its peers.    During 2015, the Company continued to demonstrate its ability to create value for shareholders and customers by returning
72 percent of its earnings to common shareholders through dividends and common share repurchases. This was accomplished by generating steady growth in commercial and consumer lending, new credit card accounts and total deposits, by building momentum
in its core business, particularly within Wealth Management and Securities Services and Payment Services, and by maintaining a very strong capital base.  
 The Company s common equity tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio using the Basel III standardized approach and Basel III advanced approaches, as if
fully implemented, were 9.1 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2015   above the Company s targeted ratio of 8.0 percent and well above the minimum ratio of 7.0 percent required when fully implemented. Refer to
 Non-GAAP Financial

Measures  for further information on the calculation of these measures. In addition, refer to Table 23 for a summary of the statutory capital ratios in effect for the Company at
December 31, 2015 and 2014. Further, credit rating organizations rate the Company s debt among the highest of any bank in the world. This comparative financial strength provides the Company with favorable funding costs, strong liquidity
and the ability to attract new customers.    In 2015, average loans and deposits increased $8.8 billion (3.6 percent) and
$20.5 billion (7.7 percent), respectively, over 2014, reflecting the confidence the Company s customers have in trusting one of the highest rated banks in the world. Loan growth included increases in commercial, commercial real
estate, credit card and other retail loans, partially offset by a decline in loans covered by loss sharing agreements with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) ( covered  loans), which is a run-off portfolio.
Deposit growth included increases in noninterest-bearing and total savings deposits.    The Company s provision for credit losses decreased $97
million (7.9 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014. Net charge-offs decreased $162 million (12.1 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, principally due to improvement in economic conditions during 2015. The provision for credit losses was
$40 million less than net charge-offs in 2015, compared with $105 million less than net charge-offs in 2014, reflecting loan growth partially offset by improved economic conditions.  
 The Company s actions to generate growth in its balance sheet and revenues, combined with making prudent long-term investments to protect its
industry-leading competitive positions have put it on a positive forward-looking trajectory. This has been accomplished by helping its customers build financially secure futures, along with deliberate efforts to optimize its expense management
initiatives. The Company has positioned itself for growth in 2016, following record fourth quarter 2015 revenue, increasing loan growth and stable net interest margin, while making progress toward achieving positive operating leverage by
thoughtfully managing expenses. The Company remains focused on delivering consistent, predictable and repeatable financial results for the benefit of its customers, employees, communities and shareholders.

Earnings Summary  The Company reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $5.88 billion in 2015, or
$3.16 per diluted common share, compared with $5.85 billion, or $3.08 per diluted common share, in 2014. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.44 percent and 14.0 percent, respectively, in 2015, compared with
1.54 percent and 14.7 percent, respectively, in 2014.    Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis, for 2015 was $145 million
(0.7 percent) higher than 2014, reflecting a 2.0 percent increase in net interest income, partially offset by a 0.8 percent decrease in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income from the prior year was the result of an
increase in average earning assets and continued growth in lower cost core deposit funding, partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to a gain related to an equity interest in
Nuveen Investments ( Nuveen gain ) recorded in 2014, lower gains from sales of shares of Visa Inc. Class B common stock, a 2015 market valuation adjustment to write down the value of student loans during the period they were held for sale
( student loan market adjustment ), and lower mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher revenue in most other fee businesses and a gain on the sale of a Health Savings Account deposit portfolio ( HSA deposit sale )
recorded in 2015.    Noninterest expense in 2015 was $216 million (2.0 percent) higher than 2014, primarily due to higher compensation
and employee benefits expenses, including higher costs related to risk and compliance activities, partially offset by a settlement relating to the Federal Housing Administration s insurance program ( FHA DOJ settlement ) recorded in
2014, prior year legal accruals and charitable contributions.     Acquisitions  In June 2014, the Company acquired the Chicago-area branch banking operations of
the Charter One Bank franchise ( Charter One ) owned by RBS Citizens Financial Group. The acquisition included Charter One s retail branch network, small business operations and select middle market relationships. The Company acquired
approximately $969 million of loans and $4.8 billion of deposits with this transaction.     STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS   
  Net Interest Income  Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was $11.2 billion in 2015, compared with $11.0 billion in 2014 and
$10.8 billion in 2013. The $217 million (2.0 percent) increase in net interest income in 2015, compared with 2014, was primarily the result of growth

in average earning assets and continued growth in lower cost core deposit funding, partially offset by a continued shift in loan portfolio mix, lower reinvestment rates on investment securities
and lower loan fees due to the wind down of the short-term, small-dollar deposit advance product, Checking Account Advance ( CAA ). Average earning assets were $26.4 billion (7.8 percent) higher in 2015, compared with 2014,
driven by increases in loans and investment securities. The net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in 2015 was 3.05 percent, compared with 3.23 percent in 2014 and 3.44 percent in 2013. The decrease in the net interest
margin in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily reflected a change in the loan portfolio mix, growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates and lower reinvestment rates on investment securities, as well as lower loan fees due to the CAA
product wind down. Refer to the  Interest Rate Risk Management  section for further information on the sensitivity of the Company s net interest income to changes in interest rates.  
 Average total loans were $250.5 billion in 2015, compared with $241.7 billion in 2014. The $8.8 billion (3.6 percent) increase was
driven by growth in commercial, commercial real estate, credit card and other retail loans, partially offset by a decrease in covered loans. Average commercial loans increased $8.3 billion (11.0 percent), driven by higher demand for loans from
new and existing customers. Average commercial real estate loans increased $1.8 billion (4.5 percent), driven by the reclassification of covered commercial real estate loans resulting from the expiration of loss sharing agreements related to those
loans at the end of 2014, as well as higher loan demand. Average credit card balances increased $422 million (2.4 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, due to customer growth, including portfolio acquisitions during 2015. The $726 million (1.5
percent) increase in average other retail loans was primarily due to higher auto and installment loans, partially offset by lower student loan balances, reflecting their classification as held for sale for a portion of 2015. Average residential
mortgages were essentially unchanged in 2015, compared with 2014. Average covered loans decreased $2.6 billion (34.1 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, the result of portfolio run-off and the expiration of the loss sharing agreements on
commercial and commercial real estate loans at the end of 2014.

  Interest and rates are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis utilizing a federal tax rate of 35 percent.     

(b)  
  Excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities and any premiums or discounts recorded related to the transfer of investment securities at fair value from available-for-sale to
held-to-maturity.     
    
  Average investment securities in 2015 were $12.8 billion (14.2 percent) higher than 2014,
primarily due to purchases of U.S. government and agency-backed securities, net of prepayments and maturities, to support regulatory liquidity coverage ratio requirements.  
 Average total deposits for 2015 were $20.5 billion (7.7 percent) higher than 2014. Average noninterest-bearing deposits for 2015 were
$5.7 billion (7.8 percent) higher than the prior year, reflecting growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking, and Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate. Average total savings deposits for 2015 were $21.0 billion
(13.8 percent) higher than 2014, reflecting growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking, including the impact of the Charter One branch acquisitions, Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate and corporate trust balances. Average time
deposits for 2015 were $6.2 billion (14.9 percent) lower than 2014. Changes in time deposits are largely related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other wholesale funding sources, based largely on funding needs and relative
pricing.    The $169 million (1.6 percent) increase in net interest income in 2014, compared with 2013, was primarily the result of
growth in average earning assets and lower cost core deposit funding, partially offset by lower rates on new loans and investment securities and lower loan fees. Average earning assets were $25.9 billion (8.2 percent) higher in 2014,
compared with 2013, driven by increases in loans and investment securities, partially offset by decreases in loans

held for sale. The decrease in the net interest margin in 2014, compared with 2013, primarily reflected lower reinvestment rates on investment securities, as well as growth in the investment
portfolio at lower average rates, lower loan fees due to the CAA product wind down, and strong growth in lower margin commercial loans, partially offset by lower funding costs.  
 Average total loans increased $14.2 billion (6.3 percent) in 2014, compared with 2013, driven by growth in commercial loans, residential
mortgages, commercial real estate loans, credit card loans and other retail loans, partially offset by a decrease in covered loans. Average commercial loans, residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans increased $8.5 billion
(12.6 percent), $3.8 billion (8.0 percent) and $2.4 billion (6.2 percent), respectively, driven by higher demand for loans from new and existing customers. Average credit card balances increased $822 million (4.9 percent) in 2014,
compared with 2013, due to customer growth. The $1.2 billion (2.6 percent) increase in average other retail loans was primarily due to higher auto and installment loans, partially offset by lower student loan balances. Average covered loans
decreased $2.5 billion (24.7 percent) in 2014, compared with 2013.   Average investment securities in 2014 were $15.3 billion
(20.4 percent) higher than 2013, due to purchases of U.S. government and agency-backed securities, net of prepayments and maturities, in preparation for final liquidity coverage ratio requirements.

TABLE 3    NET INTEREST INCOME   CHANGES DUE TO RATE AND VOLUME (a)  

(a)  
  This table shows the components of the change in net interest income by volume and rate on a taxable-equivalent basis utilizing a tax rate of 35 percent. This table does not take into account the level of
noninterest-bearing funding, nor does it fully reflect changes in the mix of assets and liabilities. The change in interest not solely due to changes in volume or rates has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to volume and yield/rate.

Average total deposits for 2014 were $16.2 billion (6.5 percent) higher than 2013. Average
noninterest-bearing deposits for 2014 were $4.4 billion (6.4 percent) higher than 2013, reflecting growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking, including the impact of the Charter One branch acquisitions, Wholesale Banking and
Commercial Real Estate, and Wealth Management and Securities Services balances. Average total savings deposits for 2014 were $15.2 billion (11.2 percent) higher than 2013, reflecting growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking, including
the impact of the Charter One branch acquisitions, Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate and corporate trust balances. Average time deposits, which are managed based on funding needs and relative pricing, decreased $3.5 billion
(7.6 percent) in 2014, compared with 2013.     Provision for Credit Losses  The provision for credit losses reflects changes in the size and credit
quality of the entire portfolio of loans. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses considered appropriate by management for probable and estimable incurred losses, based on factors

discussed in the  Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses  section.  
 In 2015, the provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, compared with $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The provision for credit losses was lower than net charge-offs by $40 million in 2015, $105 million in 2014 and $125 million in 2013. The $97 million (7.9 percent) decrease in the provision for credit losses in 2015, compared with 2014, reflected
improving credit trends and the underlying risk profile of the loan portfolio as economic conditions continued to slowly improve during the period, partially offset by portfolio growth. Nonperforming assets decreased $285 million (15.8 percent)
from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, primarily driven by nonperforming asset reductions in the commercial real estate, residential mortgages, and home equity and second mortgage portfolios, as economic conditions continued to
slowly improve during the period. In addition, accruing loans ninety days or more past due decreased by $114 million (12.1 percent) from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Net charge-offs decreased $162 million (12.1 percent) in

2015 from 2014 due to improvement in the residential mortgages, and home equity and second mortgages portfolios, as economic conditions continue to slowly improve in 2015, partially offset by
higher commercial loan net charge-offs.    The $111 million (8.3 percent) decrease in the provision for credit losses in 2014, compared with 2013,
reflected improving credit trends in residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages as economic conditions improved during 2014, partially offset by portfolio growth and higher commercial loan net charge-offs and lower commercial real
estate loan recoveries in 2014. Accruing loans ninety days or more past due decreased by $244 million (20.5 percent) from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014, primarily reflecting improvement in the residential mortgages portfolio.
Nonperforming assets decreased $229 million (11.2 percent) from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014, primarily driven by reductions in the commercial, commercial mortgage and construction and development portfolios, as well as by
improvement in credit card loans. Net charge-offs decreased $131 million (8.9 percent) in 2014 from 2013 due to the improvement in the residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages portfolios, reflecting improving economic
conditions, partially offset by higher commercial loan net charge-offs and lower commercial real estate loan recoveries in 2014.    Refer to
 Corporate Risk Profile  for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing
the allowance for credit losses.  

Noninterest Income  Noninterest income in 2015 was $9.1 billion, compared with $9.2 billion in 2014 and
$8.8 billion in 2013. The $72 million (0.8 percent) decrease in 2015 from 2014 reflected the 2014 Nuveen gain, lower gains from Visa stock sales, the 2015 student loan market adjustment and lower mortgage banking revenue,
partially offset by higher revenue in most other fee businesses and the 2015 HSA deposit sale gain. The decrease in mortgage banking revenue in 2015 of 10.2 percent, compared with 2014, was primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of
mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ), net of hedging activities, partially offset by an increase in mortgage production volume. Credit and debit card revenue increased 4.8 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, due to higher transaction
volumes. Trust and investment management fees increased 5.5 percent, reflecting the benefits of the Company s investments in its corporate trust and fund services businesses, as well as account growth, improved market conditions and lower fee
waivers. Merchant processing services revenue was 2.4 percent higher as a result of higher transaction volumes, along with account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip technology requirements. Adjusted for the impact of
foreign currency rate changes, the increase would have been approximately 6.9 percent. In addition, treasury management fees increased 2.9 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, due to higher transaction volumes, and commercial products revenue
increased due to higher syndication and bond underwriting fees and higher commercial leasing revenue, partially offset by lower standby letter of credit fees.

      31       

The $390 million (4.4 percent) increase in noninterest income in 2014 from 2013 was
principally due to increases in a majority of fee revenue categories and other income, partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking revenue. Trust and investment management fees increased 9.9 percent in 2014, compared with 2013, reflecting
account growth, improved market conditions and business expansion. Merchant processing services revenue was 3.6 percent higher as a result of an increase in fee-based product revenue and higher volumes, partially offset by lower rates. Credit and
debit card revenue and corporate payment products revenue increased 5.8 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, primarily due to higher transaction volumes. Deposit service charges were 3.4 percent higher due to account growth, the Charter One branch
acquisitions and pricing changes. Investment products fee revenue increased 7.3 percent primarily due to higher transaction volumes. Other income increased 82.8 percent in 2014, compared with 2013, reflecting higher equity investment income,
including 2014 gains on Visa stock sales and the Nuveen gain, and higher retail leasing revenue. The decrease in mortgage banking revenue in 2014 of 25.6 percent, compared with 2013, was primarily due to lower origination and sales revenue,
partially offset by favorable changes in the valuation of MSRs, net of hedging activities.  

Noninterest Expense  Noninterest expense in 2015 was $10.9 billion, compared with $10.7 billion in 2014 and
$10.3 billion in 2013. The Company s efficiency ratio was 53.8 percent in 2015, compared with 53.2 percent in 2014 and 52.4 percent in 2013. The $216 million (2.0 percent) increase in noninterest expense in 2015 over 2014
reflected higher compensation, employee benefits and other costs related to compliance activities during 2015. Compensation expense increased 6.4 percent, reflecting the impact of merit increases, higher staffing for risk and compliance activities,
as well as the Charter One branch acquisitions. Employee benefits expense increased 12.1 percent, primarily the result of higher pension costs. In addition, technology and communications expense increased 2.8 percent in 2015 over 2014, reflecting
higher software license and maintenance costs. Offsetting these increases was a 5.5 percent decrease in marketing and business development expense reflecting higher charitable contributions in 2014, a 9.5 percent decrease in postage, printing and
supplies expense due to a 2015 reimbursement from a business partner, and a 12.6 percent decrease in other intangibles expense due to the reduction or completion of amortization of certain intangibles. In addition, other expense decreased 8.0
percent, reflecting the impact of the 2014 FHA DOJ settlement and prior year legal accruals, partially offset by higher current year compliance-related expenses.

  Computed as noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income excluding net securities gains (losses).     
    
      32       

The $441 million (4.3 percent) increase in noninterest expense in 2014 over 2013 was the result
of increases in most noninterest expense categories. Compensation expense increased 3.5 percent, reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions and higher staffing for risk, compliance and internal audit activities (partially offset by lower
employee benefits expense of 8.7 percent, driven by lower pension costs). Net occupancy and equipment expense was 4.0 percent higher due to business initiatives and higher maintenance costs, and professional services expense increased 8.7 percent
due mainly to mortgage servicing-related and other project costs. Marketing and business development expense increased 7.0 percent primarily due to higher charitable contributions, technology and communications expense increased 1.8 percent as
result of business initiatives across most business lines, and postage printing and supplies expense increased 5.8 percent due to higher postage expense and demand for credit and prepaid cards. In addition, other expense increased 16.7 percent in
2014 over 2013, reflecting the 2014 FHA DOJ settlement, accruals related to certain legal matters, Charter One merger integration costs and mortgage servicing-related expenses, partially offset by lower tax-advantaged project costs.  
  Pension Plans  Because of the long-term nature of pension plans, the related accounting is complex and can be impacted by several factors, including investment
funding policies, accounting methods and actuarial assumptions.    The Company s pension accounting reflects the long-term nature of the benefit
obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets. Amounts recorded in the financial statements reflect actuarial assumptions about participant benefits and plan asset returns. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences in actual plan
experience, compared with actuarial assumptions, are deferred and recognized in expense in future periods. Differences related to participant benefits are recognized in expense over the future service period of the employees. Differences related to
the expected return on plan assets are included in expense over a period of approximately twelve years.    The Company expects pension expense to
decrease approximately $100 million in 2016, primarily driven by a higher expected return on plan assets due to 2015 actual and 2016 expected contributions, a higher discount rate and lower expected amortization due to recognition of prior losses.
Because of the complexity of forecasting pension plan activities, the accounting methods utilized for pension plans, the Company s ability to respond to factors affecting the plans and the hypothetical nature of actuarial assumptions, the
actual pension expense decrease may differ from the expected amount.

Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
the Company s pension plan funding practices, investment policies and asset allocation strategies, and accounting policies for pension plans.    The following
table shows an analysis of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and long-term rate of return ( LTROR ):      
    Income Tax Expense  The provision for income taxes was $2.1 billion (an effective rate of 26.1 percent) in 2015 and 2014, and $2.0
billion (an effective rate of 26.2 percent) in 2013.    For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.     BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS     Average
earning assets were $367.4 billion in 2015, compared with $341.0 billion in 2014. The increase in average earning assets of $26.4 billion (7.8 percent) was primarily due to increases in investment securities of $12.8 billion
(14.2 percent), loans of $8.8 billion (3.6 percent) and loans held for sale of $2.6 billion (83.7 percent).    For average balance
information, refer to Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates on pages 154 and 155.     Loans  The Company s loan portfolio was
$260.8 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $247.9 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $13.0 billion (5.2 percent). The increase was driven by increases in commercial loans of $8.0 billion
(10.0 percent), credit card loans of $2.5 billion (13.5 percent), other retail loans of $1.9 billion (3.9 percent) and residential mortgages of $1.9 billion (3.6 percent), partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans
of $658 million (1.5 percent) and covered loans of $685 million (13.0 percent). Table 6 provides a summary of the loan distribution by product type, while Table 12 provides a summary of the selected loan maturity distribution by loan category.
Average total loans increased $8.8 billion (3.6 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014. The increase was due to growth in most loan portfolio classes in 2015.

33       

Commercial   Commercial loans, including lease financing, increased $8.0 billion (10.0 percent) at
December 31, 2015, compared with December 31, 2014. Average commercial loans increased $8.3 billion (11.0 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014. The growth was primarily driven by higher demand from new and existing
customers. Table 7 provides a summary of commercial loans by industry and geographical locations.      Commercial Real Estate   The Company s portfolio
of commercial real estate loans, which includes commercial mortgages and construction and development loans, decreased $658 million (1.5 percent) at December 31, 2015, compared with December 31, 2014, primarily the result of customers
paying down balances in the second half of 2015. Average commercial real estate loans increased $1.8 billion (4.5 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014. Table 8 provides a summary of commercial real estate loans by property type and
geographical location.  
 
  The Company reclassifies construction loans to the commercial mortgage category if permanent financing is
provided by the Company. In 2015, approximately $361 million of construction loans were reclassified to the commercial mortgage category. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $155 million of tax-exempt industrial development loans were secured by
real estate. The Company s commercial mortgage and construction and development loans had unfunded commitments of $10.4 billion and $10.7 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  
 The Company also finances the operations of real estate developers and other entities with operations related to real estate. These loans are not
secured directly by real estate but are subject to terms and conditions similar to commercial loans. These loans were included in the commercial loan category and totaled $5.8 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.

Residential Mortgages   Residential mortgages held in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2015, increased
$1.9 billion (3.6 percent) over December 31, 2014, reflecting higher origination and refinancing activity during 2015. Average residential mortgages were essentially flat in 2015, compared with 2014. Residential mortgages originated
and placed in the Company s loan portfolio include well-secured jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien home equity loans to borrowers with high credit quality.

Credit Card   Total credit card loans increased $2.5 billion (13.5 percent) at December 31,
2015, compared with December 31, 2014. Average credit card balances increased $422 million (2.4 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014. The increases reflected new and existing customer growth during the period, including the 2015
acquisitions of credit card portfolios from Fidelity Investments and Auto Club Trust.

Other Retail   Total other retail loans, which include retail leasing, home equity and second mortgages and
other retail loans, increased $1.9 billion (3.9 percent) at December 31, 2015, compared with December 31, 2014. Average other retail loans increased $726 million (1.5 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014. The increases were
primarily due to higher auto and installment loans, and home equity and second mortgages, partially offset by lower retail leasing and student loan balances. Of the total residential mortgages, credit card and other retail loans outstanding at

December 31, 2015, approximately 73.4 percent were to customers located in the Company s primary banking region compared with 73.0 percent at December 31, 2014. Tables 9, 10 and 11
provide a geographic summary of residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans outstanding, respectively, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The collateral for $3.1 billion of residential mortgages and other retail loans
included in covered loans at December 31, 2015 was in California, compared with $3.5 billion at December 31, 2014.

The Company generally retains portfolio loans through maturity; however, the Company s intent may
change over time based upon various factors such as ongoing asset/liability management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company s intent or ability to hold an
existing portfolio loan changes, it is transferred to loans held for sale.     Loans Held for Sale  Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of residential
mortgages to be sold in the secondary market,

were $3.2 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $4.8 billion at December 31, 2014. The decrease in loans held for sale was principally due to a lower level of mortgage loan
closing late in 2015, compared with the same period of 2014. Almost all of the residential mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases for sale follow guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, highly liquid secondary markets;
in particular in government agency transactions and to government sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ).  

38       

TABLE 12    SELECTED LOAN MATURITY DISTRIBUTION  

Investment Securities  The Company uses its investment securities portfolio to manage enterprise interest rate risk,
provide liquidity (including the ability to meet regulatory requirements), generate interest and dividend income, and as collateral for public deposits and wholesale funding sources. While the Company intends to hold its investment securities
indefinitely, it may sell available-for-sale securities in response to structural changes in the balance sheet and related interest rate risk and to meet liquidity requirements, among other factors.  
 Investment securities totaled $105.6 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $101.0 billion at December 31, 2014. The
$4.6 billion (4.5 percent) increase reflected $5.1 billion of net investment purchases, partially offset by a $457 million unfavorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities.  
 Average investment securities were $103.2 billion in 2015, compared with $90.3 billion in 2014. The weighted-average yield of the
available-for-sale portfolio was 2.21 percent at December 31, 2015, compared with 2.32 percent at December 31, 2014. The average maturity of the available-for-sale portfolio was 4.7 years at December 31, 2015, compared
with 4.3 years at December 31, 2014. The weighted-average yield of the held-to-maturity portfolio was 1.92 percent at December 31, 2015, unchanged from December 31, 2014. The average maturity of the held-to-maturity portfolio was
4.2 years at December 31, 2015, compared with 4.0 years at December 31, 2014. Investment securities by type are shown in Table 13.    The
Company s available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other

comprehensive income (loss) unless a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. At December 31, 2015, the Company s net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities
were $180 million, compared with $637 million at December 31, 2014. The unfavorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of agency mortgage-backed and state and political securities as a
result of increases in interest rates. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities totaled $480 million at December 31, 2015, compared with $343 million at December 31, 2014. The Company conducts a regular assessment of its
investment portfolio to determine whether any securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. When assessing unrealized losses for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company considers the nature of the investment, the financial condition of the
issuer, the extent and duration of unrealized loss, expected cash flows of underlying assets and market conditions. At December 31, 2015, the Company had no plans to sell securities with unrealized losses, and believes it is more likely than
not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost.    In December 2013, U.S. banking regulators
approved final rules that prohibit banks from holding certain types of investments, such as investments in hedge and certain private equity funds. The Company does not anticipate the implementation of these final rules will require any significant
liquidation of securities held or impairment charges.    Refer to Notes 5 and 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information on investment securities.

The composition of deposits was as follows:  
   
   The maturity of time deposits was as follows:      

Deposits  Total deposits were $300.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $282.7 billion at
December 31, 2014. The $17.7 billion (6.2 percent) increase in total deposits reflected growth in total savings and noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. Average total deposits in 2015 increased $20.5
billion (7.7 percent) over 2014 due to increases in total savings deposits and noninterest-bearing deposits, including those obtained in the Charter One branch acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits.  
 Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2015, increased $6.4 billion (8.3 percent) over December 31, 2014, primarily due to higher
Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate, Consumer and Small Business Banking, and corporate trust balances. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $5.7 billion (7.8 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, reflecting growth in Consumer and
Small Business Banking and Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate, as well as the impact of the Charter One branch acquisitions.  
 Interest-bearing savings deposits increased $17.0 billion (10.2 percent) at December 31, 2015, compared with

December 31, 2014. The increase was related to higher money market, interest checking and savings account balances. Money market deposit balances increased $9.6 billion (12.6
percent) at December 31, 2015, compared with December 31, 2014, primarily due to higher Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate, and broker-dealer balances. Interest checking balances increased $4.1 billion (7.5
percent) primarily due to higher Consumer and Small Business Banking, and corporate trust balances, partially offset by lower broker-dealer balances. Savings account balances increased $3.2 billion (9.1 percent), primarily due to higher
Consumer and Small Business Banking balances. Average interest-bearing savings deposits in 2015 increased $21.0 billion (13.8 percent), compared with 2014, reflecting growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking, Wholesale Banking and Commercial
Real Estate and Wealth Management and Securities Services balances, as well as the impact of the Charter One branch acquisitions.    Interest-bearing
time deposits at December 31, 2015, decreased $5.7 billion (14.9 percent), compared with December 31, 2014. Average time deposits decreased $6.2 billion (14.9 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014. Changes

41       

in time deposits are largely related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other wholesale funding sources, based largely on funding needs and relative pricing.  
  Borrowings  The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short-term borrowings,
which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term borrowings, were $27.9 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $29.9 billion at
December 31, 2014. The $2.0 billion (6.7 percent) decrease in short-term borrowings was primarily due to decreases in other short-term borrowings balances.  
 Long-term debt was $32.1 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $32.3 billion at December 31, 2014. The $182 million
(0.6 percent) decrease reflected $1.4 billion of bank note repayments, and $3.1 billion of medium-term note and subordinated note maturities, partially offset by the issuances of $2.4 billion of bank notes and a $1.7 billion increase in
Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances.    Refer to Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and the  Liquidity Risk Management  section for discussion of liquidity management of the Company.  
  CORPORATE RISK PROFILE      Overview  Managing risks is an essential part
of successfully operating a financial services company. The Company s Board of Directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risk-taking activities. This framework
includes Company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, through its Risk Management Committee,
oversees performance relative to the risk management framework, risk appetite statements, and other policy requirements.    The Executive Risk
Committee ( ERC ), which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the executive management team, oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite
statements. The ERC focuses on current and emerging risks, including strategic and reputational risks, by directing timely and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have also been established, each responsible for overseeing a specified
category of risk.    The Company s most prominent risk exposures are credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance,

strategic, and reputational. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan, investment or derivative contract when it is due. Interest rate risk is
the potential reduction of net interest income or market valuations as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that may result in changes in the
values of financial instruments, such as trading and available-for-sale securities, mortgage loans held for sale ( MLHFS ), MSRs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund
obligations or new business at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems, or from external events, including the risk of loss resulting
from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include failures by third parties with which the Company does business. Compliance risk is the risk of loss arising from violations of, or nonconformance with, laws, rules, regulations,
prescribed practices, internal policies, and procedures, or ethical standards, potentially exposing the Company to fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk also arises in situations where the
laws or rules governing certain Company products or activities of the Company s customers may be ambiguous or untested. Strategic risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions or improper implementation of
those decisions. Reputational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion. This risk may impair the Company s competitiveness by affecting its ability to
establish new relationships or services, or continue serving existing relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to  Risk Factors  beginning on page 156, for a
detailed discussion of these factors.    The Company s Board and management-level governance committees are supported by a  three lines of
defense  model for establishing effective checks and balances. The first line of defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business leaders and their risk officers
establish programs to ensure conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second line of defense, which includes the Chief Risk Officer s organization as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate support functions,
translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable risk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies, and provides reporting and escalation of emerging risks and other concerns
to senior management and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of  

42       

Directors. The third line of defense, internal audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management with independent assessment and
assurance regarding the effectiveness of the Company s governance, risk management, and control processes.    Management provides various
risk reports to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee discusses with management the Company s risk management performance, and provides a summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors,
covering the status of existing matters, areas of potential future concern, and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers quarterly reports by management assessing the Company s performance
relative to the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, including:      

Qualitative considerations, such as the macroeconomic environment, regulatory and compliance changes, litigation developments, and technology and cybersecurity;    

Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures and stressed scenarios;        

Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending limits;    

Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk;        

Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various stressed scenarios;        

Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, breaches in data security, or adverse business decisions, as well as reporting on technology
performance, and various legal and regulatory compliance measures; and        

Reputational and strategic risk considerations, impacts and responses.       Credit Risk Management  The Company s
strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes
diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. The Risk Management Committee oversees the Company s credit risk management
process.    In addition, credit quality ratings as defined by the Company, are an important part of the Company s overall credit risk management
and evaluation of its allowance for

credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the Company s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal risk has been identified. Loans with a special
mention or classified rating, including loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans, those considered troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ), and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are
behind a modified or delinquent loan in a first lien position, encompass all loans held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The Company s
internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status, except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated. For this limited population, the
determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows. The Company obtains recent collateral value estimates for the majority of its residential mortgage and home equity and second mortgage
portfolios, which allows the Company to compute estimated loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios reflecting current market conditions. These individual refreshed LTV ratios are considered in the determination of the appropriate allowance for credit
losses. However, the underwriting criteria the Company employs consider the relevant income and credit characteristics of the borrower, such that the collateral is not the primary source of repayment. The Company strives to identify potential
problem loans early, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain appropriate allowance levels for probable incurred loan losses. Refer to Notes 1 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the
Company s loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings.    The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into three segments, which is
the level at which it develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Company s three loan portfolio segments are commercial lending, consumer lending and covered loans. The commercial lending
segment includes loans and leases made to small business, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial lending segment loans
include the industry and geography of the borrower s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, borrower s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of pledged collateral, if any. These risk characteristics,
among others, are considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or

43       

forecasting losses on, these loans which are the significant factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending segment.  
 The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to consumer customers including residential mortgages, credit card loans, and other retail
loans such as revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases, student loans, and home equity loans and lines. Home equity or second mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end accounts fully disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed
rate loans, secured by residential real estate, with a 10- or 15-year fixed payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay balances repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment,
and are secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms on home equity lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10- or 15-year draw period
during which a minimum payment is equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20- or 10-year amortization period, respectively. At December 31, 2015, substantially all of the Company s home equity lines were in the draw period.
Approximately $920 million, or 6 percent, of the outstanding home equity line balances at December 31, 2015, will enter the amortization period within the next 36 months. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending segment loans
primarily relate to the borrowers  capacity and willingness to repay and include unemployment rates and other economic factors, customer payment history and in some cases, updated LTV information on real estate based loans. These risk
characteristics, among others, are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment.  
 The covered loan segment represents loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions that are covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that greatly
reduce the risk of future credit losses to the Company. Key risk characteristics for covered segment loans are consistent with the segment they would otherwise be included in had the loss share coverage not been in place, but consider the
indemnification provided by the FDIC.    The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying
risk characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail
loans. The covered loan segment consists of only one class.

Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially
the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments. The Company also engages in non-lending activities that may give rise to credit risk, including derivative transactions for
balance sheet hedging purposes, foreign exchange transactions, deposit overdrafts and interest rate swap contracts for customers, investments in securities and other financial assets, and settlement risk, including Automated Clearing House
transactions and the processing of credit card transactions for merchants. These activities are subject to credit review, analysis and approval processes.  
   Economic and Other Factors   In evaluating its credit risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the loan portfolio composition
(including product mix and geographic, industry or customer-specific concentrations), collateral values, trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product and consumer bankruptcy
filings.    Beginning in late 2007, financial markets suffered significant disruptions, leading to and exacerbated by declining real estate values and
subsequent economic challenges, both domestically and globally. Median home prices declined across most domestic markets, which had a significant adverse impact on the collectability of residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage delinquencies
increased throughout 2008 and 2009. High unemployment levels beginning in 2009, further increased losses in prime-based residential portfolios and credit cards.  
 Although economic conditions generally have stabilized from the dramatic downturn experienced in 2008 and 2009, and employment levels, median home
prices and the financial markets have slowly improved, business activities across certain industries and regions continue to face challenges due to slow global economic growth. If commodity prices inclusive of energy, remain depressed for an
extended period of time, the industry and the overall economy could be negatively impacted.    Credit costs peaked for the Company in late 2009 and
have trended downward thereafter. The provision for credit losses was lower than net charge-offs by $40 million in 2015, $105 million in 2014 and $125 million in 2013. The $97 million (7.9 percent) decrease in the provision for credit losses in
2015, compared with 2014, reflected improving credit trends and the underlying risk profile of the loan portfolio as economic conditions continued to slowly improve throughout 2015, partially offset by portfolio growth and deterioration in certain
loans to customers in energy-related businesses.  

44       

Credit Diversification   The Company manages its credit risk, in part, through diversification of its loan
portfolio and limit setting by product type criteria and concentrations. As part of its normal business activities, the Company offers a broad array of traditional commercial lending products and specialized products such as asset-based lending,
commercial lease financing, agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage lending, small business lending, commercial real estate, health care and correspondent banking. The Company also offers an array of consumer lending products, including residential
mortgages, credit card loans, auto loans, retail leases, home equity, revolving credit and other consumer loans. These consumer lending products are primarily offered through the branch office network, home mortgage and loan production offices and
indirect distribution channels, such as auto dealers. The Company monitors and manages the portfolio diversification by industry, customer and geography. Table 6 provides information with respect to the overall product diversification and changes in
the mix during 2015.    The commercial loan class is diversified among various industries with somewhat higher concentrations in manufacturing,
finance and insurance, wholesale trade, and real estate, rental and leasing. Additionally, the commercial loan class is diversified across the Company s geographical markets with 64.3 percent of total commercial loans within the Company s
Consumer and Small Business Banking region. Credit relationships outside of the Company s Consumer and Small Business Banking region relate to the corporate banking, mortgage banking, auto dealer and leasing businesses, focusing on large
national customers and specifically targeted industries. Loans to mortgage banking customers are primarily warehouse lines which are collateralized with the underlying mortgages. The Company regularly monitors its mortgage collateral position to
manage its risk exposure. Table 7 provides a summary of significant industry groups and geographical locations of commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014. At December 31, 2015, approximately $3.2 billion of the
commercial loans outstanding were to customers in energy-related businesses, compared with $3.1 billion at December 31, 2014. The decline in energy prices over the past year has resulted in deterioration of a portion of these loans; however,
the impact of this deterioration was not significant to the Company during 2015. A further decline in energy prices, or if prices remain at current levels for an extended period of time, could result in an increase in the Company s loan
charge-offs and provision for credit losses.    The commercial real estate loan class reflects the Company s focus on serving business owners
within its geographic footprint as well as regional and national

investment-based real estate owners and builders. Within the commercial real estate loan class, different property types have varying degrees of credit risk. Table 8 provides a summary of the
significant property types and geographical locations of commercial real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014. At December 31, 2015, approximately 26.6 percent of the commercial real estate loans represented business
owner-occupied properties that tend to exhibit less credit risk than non owner-occupied properties. The investment-based real estate mortgages are diversified among various property types with somewhat higher concentrations in multi-family, office
and retail properties. From a geographical perspective, the Company s commercial real estate loan class is generally well diversified. However, at December 31, 2015, 24.8 percent of the Company s commercial real estate loans were
secured by collateral in California, which has historically experienced higher delinquency levels and credit quality deterioration in recessionary periods due to excess inventory levels and declining valuations. Included in commercial real estate at
year-end 2015 was approximately $681 million in loans related to land held for development and $676 million of loans related to residential and commercial acquisition and development properties. These loans are subject to quarterly monitoring for
changes in local market conditions due to a higher credit risk profile. The commercial real estate loan class is diversified across the Company s geographical markets with 83.4 percent of total commercial real estate loans outstanding at
December 31, 2015, within the Company s Consumer and Small Business Banking region.    The Company s consumer lending segment utilizes
several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional branch lending, indirect lending, portfolio acquisitions, correspondent banks and loan brokers. Each distinct underwriting and origination activity
manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles.    Residential mortgages are
originated through the Company s branches, loan production offices and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while
retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the Company to effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in the Company s
portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages, credit risk is also diversified by geography and managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process.  
 The Company estimates updated LTV information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a

45       

method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan s outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property
value. For home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value ( CLTV ) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate of
property value. Certain loans do not have a LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans.  
 The following tables provide summary information for the LTVs of residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages by borrower type at December 31, 2015:

(a)  
  Represents loans purchased from Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ) mortgage pools whose payments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of
Veterans Affairs.     

At December 31, 2015, approximately $1.1 billion of residential mortgages were to customers that may be defined as
sub-prime borrowers based on credit scores from independent agencies at loan origination, compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014. In addition to residential mortgages, at December 31, 2015, $195 million of home equity and second
mortgage loans were to customers that may be defined as sub-prime borrowers, compared with $238 million at December 31, 2014. The total amount of consumer lending segment residential mortgage, home equity and second mortgage loans to customers
that may be defined as sub-prime borrowers represented only 0.3 percent of total assets at December 31, 2015, compared with 0.4 percent at December 31, 2014. The Company considers sub-prime loans to be those made to borrowers
with a risk of default significantly higher than those approved for prime lending programs, as reflected in credit scores obtained from independent agencies at loan origination, in addition to other credit underwriting criteria. Sub-prime portfolios
include only loans originated according to the Company s underwriting programs specifically designed to serve customers with weakened credit histories. The sub-prime designation indicators have been and will continue to be subject to
re-evaluation over time as borrower characteristics, payment  

46       

performance and economic conditions change. The sub-prime loans originated during periods from June 2009 and after are with borrowers who met the Company s program guidelines and have a
credit score that generally is at or below a threshold of 620 to 650 depending on the program. Sub-prime loans originated during periods prior to June 2009 were based upon program level guidelines without regard to credit score.  
 Home equity and second mortgages were $16.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $15.9 billion at December 31, 2014, and included $5.0
billion of home equity lines in a first lien position and $11.4 billion of home equity and second mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position. Loans and lines in a junior lien position at December 31, 2015, included approximately $4.5
billion of loans and lines for which the Company also serviced the related first lien loan, and approximately $6.9 billion where the Company did not service the related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the status of the related
first liens using information the Company has as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on customer credit bureau files. The Company also evaluates other indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines including
delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and updated weighted-average credit scores in making its assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining the allowance for credit losses.  
 The following table provides a summary of delinquency statistics and other credit quality indicators for the Company s junior lien positions at December 31,
2015:      

See the Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses section for additional information
on how the Company determines the allowance for credit losses for loans in a junior lien position.    Credit card and other retail loans principally
reflect the Company s focus on consumers within its geographical footprint of branches and certain niche lending activities that are nationally focused. Approximately 71.1 percent of the Company s credit card balances at December 31,
2015 relate to cards originated through the Company s branches or co-branded, travel and affinity programs that generally experience better credit quality performance than portfolios generated through other channels.  
 Tables 9, 10 and 11 provide a geographical summary of the residential mortgage, credit card and other retail loan portfolios, respectively.  
 Covered assets were acquired by the Company in FDIC-assisted transactions and include loans with characteristics indicative of a high credit risk
profile, including a substantial concentration in California and loans with negative-amortization payment options. Because these loans are covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, the Company s financial exposure to losses from
these assets is substantially reduced. To the extent actual losses exceed the Company s estimates at acquisition, the Company s financial risk would only be its share of those losses under the loss sharing agreements. As of
December 31, 2015, the loss share coverage provided by the FDIC has expired on all previously covered assets, except for residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgage loans that remain covered under loss sharing agreements with
remaining terms of up to four years.  

47       

TABLE 15     DELINQUENT
LOAN RATIOS AS A PERCENT OF ENDING LOAN BALANCES       

Loan Delinquencies   Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk
within the Company s loan portfolios. The entire balance of an account is considered delinquent if the minimum payment contractually required to be made is not received by the specified date on the billing statement. The Company measures
delinquencies, both including and excluding nonperforming loans, to enable comparability with other companies. Delinquent loans purchased from Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ) mortgage pools whose repayments are primarily
insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as student loans guaranteed by the federal government, are excluded from delinquency statistics. In addition, in certain situations, a
consumer lending customer s account may be re-aged to remove it from delinquent status. Generally, the purpose of re-aging accounts is to assist customers who have recently

overcome temporary financial difficulties, and have demonstrated both the ability and willingness to resume regular payments. To qualify for re-aging, the account must have been open for at least
nine months and cannot have been re-aged during the preceding 365 days. An account may not be re-aged more than two times in a five-year period. To qualify for re-aging, the customer must also have made three regular minimum monthly payments
within the last 90 days. In addition, the Company may re-age the consumer lending account of a customer who has experienced longer-term financial difficulties and apply modified, concessionary terms and conditions to the account. Such
additional re-ages are limited to one in a five-year period and must meet the qualifications for re-aging described above. All re-aging strategies must be independently approved by the Company s risk management department. Commercial lending
loans are generally not subject to re-aging policies.  

48       

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $831 million ($541 million excluding covered loans) at
December 31, 2015, compared with $945 million ($550 million excluding covered loans) at December 31, 2014, and $1.2 billion ($713 million excluding covered loans) at December 31, 2013. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due are
not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status, or are
managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.32 percent (0.21 percent excluding covered loans) at
December 31, 2015, compared with 0.38 percent (0.23 percent excluding covered loans) at December 31, 2014, and 0.51 percent (0.31 percent excluding covered loans) at December 31, 2013.  
 The following table provides summary delinquency information for residential mortgages, credit card and other retail loans included in the consumer lending segment:  

(b)  
  Includes revolving credit, installment, automobile and student loans.

The following tables provide further information on residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages as a percent
of ending loan balances by borrower type at December 31:      

(a)  
  Excludes delinquent and nonperforming information on loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools as their repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of
Veterans Affairs.         
   The following table provides summary delinquency information for covered loans:  

49       

Restructured Loans   In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the
collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate, extension of the
maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered.      Troubled Debt Restructurings   Concessionary modifications
are classified as TDRs unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in the payments to be received. TDRs accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a
level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater. At December 31, 2015, performing TDRs were $4.7 billion, compared with $5.1 billion, $6.0 billion, $5.6 billion and $4.9 billion
at December 31, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Loans classified as TDRs are considered impaired loans for reporting and measurement purposes.  
 The Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties, including those acquired through
FDIC-assisted acquisitions. Many of the Company s TDRs are determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary within each of the Company s loan classes. Commercial lending
segment TDRs generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses, such as
obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees to support the loan.    The Company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan
restructuring programs that may result in TDRs. The Company participates in the U.S. Department of the Treasury Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ). HAMP gives qualifying homeowners an opportunity to permanently modify their
loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments, with the U.S. Department of the Treasury compensating the Company for a portion of the reduction in

monthly amounts due from borrowers participating in this program. The Company also modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal Housing Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and
its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company provides concessions to qualifying borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The concessions may include adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates,
extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, participation in residential mortgage loan
restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement and the loan documents are not modified until that
time. The Company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs and continues to report them as TDRs after the trial period.    Credit card and
other retail loan TDRs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period, generally up to 60 months.  
 In accordance with regulatory guidance, the Company considers secured consumer loans that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower
has not reaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the collateral value, the loan is charged down to collateral value and the remaining amount is reported as nonperforming.  
 Modifications to covered loans in the covered segment are similar in nature to that described above for non-covered loans, and the evaluation and
determination of TDR status is similar, except that acquired loans restructured after acquisition are not considered TDRs for purposes of the Company s accounting and disclosure if the loans evidenced credit deterioration as of the acquisition
date and are accounted for in pools. Losses associated with modifications on covered loans, including the economic impact of interest rate reductions, are generally eligible for reimbursement under the loss sharing agreements.

50       

The following table provides a summary of TDRs by loan class, including the delinquency status for TDRs that continue to
accrue interest and TDRs included in nonperforming assets:      

(a)  
  Primarily represents loans less than six months from the modification date that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status (generally six months) and small business credit cards with a
modified rate equal to 0 percent.     

(b)  
  Primarily represents loans less than six months from the modification date that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status (generally six months).     

(c)  
  Primarily represents loans with a modified rate equal to 0 percent.     

(d)  
  Includes $299 million of residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $77 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period arrangements but not
successfully completed.     

(e)  
  Includes $104 million of other retail loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $19 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period arrangements but not
successfully completed.     

(f)  
  Includes $460 million of Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $668 million in trial period
arrangements or previously placed in trial period arrangements but not successfully completed.     
    
    Short-term Modifications   The Company makes short-term modifications that it does not consider to be TDRs, in
limited circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. Consumer lending programs include payment reductions, deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required
payments. The Company may also make short-term modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most common modification being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less. Such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is
imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed. Short-term modifications were not material at December 31, 2015.  
   Nonperforming Assets   The level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified terms and not accruing interest, restructured loans that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status, other real estate owned
( OREO ) and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Nonperforming assets are generally either originated by the Company or acquired under FDIC loss sharing agreements that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the
Company. Interest payments collected from assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the principal

balance and not recorded as income. However, interest income may be recognized for interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible.  
 At December 31, 2015, total nonperforming assets were $1.5 billion, compared with $1.8 billion at December 31, 2014 and
$2.0 billion at December 31, 2013. The $285 million (15.8 percent) decrease in nonperforming assets, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, was primarily driven by reductions in the commercial real estate
loans, residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgage balances, as economic conditions continued to slowly improve during 2015. Nonperforming covered assets at December 31, 2015 were $40 million, compared with $51 million at
December 31, 2014 and $224 million at December 31, 2013. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate was 0.58 percent at December 31, 2015, compared with 0.73 percent at December 31,
2014, and 0.86 percent at December 31, 2013.    OREO, excluding covered assets, was $280 million at December 31, 2015, compared
with $288 million at December 31, 2014 and $327 million at December 31, 2013, and was related to foreclosed properties that previously secured loan balances. These balances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are
primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

TABLE 17    NET CHARGE-OFFS AS A PERCENT OF AVERAGE LOANS OUTSTANDING  

53       

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs   Total loan net charge-offs were $1.2 billion in 2015, compared with
$1.3 billion in 2014 and $1.5 billion in 2013. The decrease in total net charge-offs in 2015, compared with 2014, reflected improvement in the residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages portfolios, as economic conditions
continue to slowly improve during the period, partially offset by higher commercial loan net charge-offs. The ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans was 0.47 percent in 2015, compared with 0.55 percent in 2014 and
0.64 percent in 2013.    Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs for 2015 were $191 million (0.15 percent of average
loans outstanding), compared with $182 million (0.16 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2014 and $87 million (0.08 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2013. The increase in net charge-offs in 2015, compared with 2014, reflected lower
commercial loan recoveries in 2015. The increase in net charge-offs in 2014, compared with 2013, reflected higher commercial loan net charge-offs and lower recoveries in commercial real estate.  
 Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs for 2015 were $109 million (0.21 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $195 million
(0.38 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2014 and $272 million (0.57 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2013. Credit card loan net charge-offs in 2015 were $651 million (3.61 percent of average loans
outstanding), compared with $658 million (3.73 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2014 and $656 million (3.90 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2013. Other retail loan net charge-offs for 2015 were $221 million
(0.45 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $288 million (0.60 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2014 and $418 million (0.89 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2013. The decrease in total residential
mortgage, credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs in 2015, compared with 2014, reflected continued improvement in economic conditions during 2015. The decrease in total residential mortgage, credit card and other retail loan net
charge-offs in 2014, compared with 2013, reflected improvement in economic conditions during 2014, especially in residential housing prices.

The following table provides an analysis of net charge-offs as a percent of average loans outstanding for residential
mortgages and home equity and second mortgages by borrower type:      

(a)  
  Represents loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools whose payments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.     
   Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses   The allowance for credit losses reserves for probable and estimable losses incurred in the
Company s loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, and includes certain amounts that do not represent loss exposure to the Company because those losses are recoverable under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. The
allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge-offs. Management evaluates the allowance each quarter to ensure it appropriately reserves for incurred losses. The evaluation of each
element and the overall allowance is based on a continuing assessment of problem loans, recent loss experience and other factors, including external factors such as regulatory guidance and economic conditions. Because business processes and credit
risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company s analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios.  
 At December 31, 2015, the allowance for credit losses was $4.3 billion (1.65 percent of period-end loans), compared with an allowance of $4.4
billion (1.77 percent of period-end loans) at December 31, 2014. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 361 percent at December 31, 2015, compared with 298 percent at December 31, 2014, reflecting a
decrease in nonperforming loans. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annual loan net charge-offs at December 31, 2015, was 367 percent, compared with 328 percent at December 31, 2014, reflecting

54       

the impact of improving economic conditions over the past year. Management determined the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2015.  
 The allowance recorded for loans in the commercial lending segment is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and considers the migration
analysis of commercial lending segment loans and actual loss experience. In the migration analysis applied to risk rated loan portfolios, the Company currently examines up to a 15-year period of historical loss experience. For each loan type, this
historical loss experience is adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices or economic conditions. The results of the analysis are evaluated
quarterly to confirm an appropriate historical timeframe is selected for each commercial loan type. The allowance recorded for impaired loans greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is based on an individual loan analysis
utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent loans, rather than the migration
analysis. The allowance recorded for all other commercial lending segment loans is determined on a homogenous pool basis and includes consideration of product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy experience, and historical losses,
adjusted for current trends. The allowance established for commercial lending segment loans was $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $1.9 billion at December 31, 2014, reflecting growth in the portfolios and the uncertain
outlook for commodity prices. At December 31, 2015 the Company had credit reserves of approximately 5 percent of total energy loan balances.    The
allowance recorded for TDR loans and purchased impaired loans in the consumer lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool, or the prior
quarter effective rate, respectively. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans in the consumer lending segment is determined based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. The allowance recorded for all other consumer lending
segment loans is determined on a homogenous pool basis and includes consideration of product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy experience, delinquency status, refreshed LTV ratios when possible, portfolio growth and historical
losses, adjusted for current trends. Credit card and other retail loans 90 days or more past due are generally not placed on nonaccrual status because of the relatively short period of time to charge-off and, therefore, are excluded from
nonperforming loans and measures that include nonperforming loans as part of the calculation.    When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance
for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the Company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien. At December 31, 2015, the Company serviced the first lien on 39 percent of the home equity
loans and lines in a

junior lien position. The Company also considers information received from its primary regulator on the status of the first liens that are serviced by other large servicers in the industry and
the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files. Regardless of whether or not the Company services the first lien, an assessment is made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss experience and other
factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. Based on the available information, the Company estimated $291 million or 1.8 percent of the total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2015, represented non-delinquent junior liens where
the first lien was delinquent or modified.    The Company uses historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position where the
first lien is serviced by the Company, or can be identified in credit bureau data, to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the Company services that are current, but the first lien is delinquent or modified. Historically, the
number of junior lien defaults in any period has been a small percentage of the total portfolio (for example, only 0.7 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015), and the long-term average loss rate on the small percentage of loans
that default has been approximately 80 percent. In addition, the Company obtains updated credit scores on its home equity portfolio each quarter, and in some cases more frequently, and uses this information to qualitatively supplement its loss
estimation methods. Credit score distributions for the portfolio are monitored monthly and any changes in the distribution are one of the factors considered in assessing the Company s loss estimates. In its evaluation of the allowance for
credit losses, the Company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment and with residential lines and loans that have a
balloon payoff provision.    The allowance established for consumer lending segment loans was $2.3 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with
$2.4 billion at December 31, 2014. The $181 million (7.4 percent) decrease in the allowance for consumer lending segment loans at December 31, 2015, compared with December 31, 2014, reflected the impact of more stable economic
conditions during 2015, partially offset by portfolio growth.    The allowance for the covered loan segment is evaluated each quarter in a manner
similar to that described for non-covered loans, and represents any decreases in expected cash flows on those loans after the acquisition date. The provision for credit losses for covered loans considers the indemnification provided by the FDIC. The
allowance established for covered loans was $38 million at December 31, 2015, compared with $65 million at December 31, 2014, reflecting expected credit losses in excess of initial fair value adjustments, including $2 million and $16
million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to be reimbursed by the FDIC.

TABLE 18    SUMMARY OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  

(a)  
  Relates to covered loan charge-offs and recoveries not reimbursable by the FDIC.     

(b)  
  Includes net changes in credit losses to be reimbursed by the FDIC and beginning in 2013, reductions in the allowance for covered loans where the reversal of a previously recorded allowance was offset by an
associated decrease in the indemnification asset, and the impact of any loan sales.     
    
      56       

TABLE 19    ELEMENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  

In addition, the evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for purchased non-impaired
loans acquired after January 1, 2009, in the various loan segments considers credit discounts recorded as a part of the initial determination of the fair value of the loans. For these loans, no allowance for credit losses is recorded at the
purchase date. Credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loans are a component of the initial fair value. Subsequent to the purchase date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for credit
losses for these loans is similar to originated loans; however, the Company records a provision for credit losses only when the required allowance, net of any expected reimbursement under any loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, exceeds any
remaining credit discounts.    The evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for purchased impaired loans in the various loan segments
considers the expected cash flows to be collected from the borrower. These loans are initially recorded at fair value and therefore no allowance for credit losses is recorded at the purchase date.  
 Subsequent to the purchase date, the expected cash flows of purchased loans are subject to evaluation. Decreases in expected cash flows are recognized
by recording an allowance for credit losses with the related provision for credit losses reduced for the amount reimbursable by the FDIC, where applicable. If the expected cash flows on the purchased loans increase such that a previously recorded
impairment allowance can be reversed, the Company records a reduction in the allowance with a related reduction in losses reimbursable by the FDIC, where applicable. Increases in

expected cash flows of purchased loans, when there are no reversals of previous impairment allowances, are recognized over the remaining life of the loans and resulting decreases in expected cash
flows of the FDIC indemnification assets are amortized over the shorter of the remaining contractual term of the indemnification agreements or the remaining life of the loans. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
for more information.    The Company s methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses for all the loan segments also
considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used. As a result, in addition to the amounts determined under the methodologies described above, management also considers the potential impact of other qualitative factors which include, but
are not limited to, economic factors; geographic and other concentration risks; delinquency and nonaccrual trends; current business conditions; changes in lending policy, underwriting standards, internal review and other relevant business practices;
and the regulatory environment. The consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the Company s allowance for credit losses for each of the above loan segments. Table 19 shows the amount of the allowance
for credit losses by loan segment, class and underlying portfolio category.    Although the Company determines the amount of each element of the
allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses incurred can vary significantly from the
estimated amounts.  

57       

Residual Value Risk Management  The Company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased assets
through disciplined residual valuation setting at the inception of a lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. Commercial
lease originations are subject to the same well-defined underwriting standards referred to in the  Credit Risk Management  section which includes an evaluation of the residual value risk. Retail lease residual value risk is mitigated
further by originating longer-term vehicle leases and effective end-of-term marketing of off-lease vehicles.    Included in the retail leasing
portfolio was approximately $4.4 billion of retail leasing residuals at December 31, 2015, compared with $4.8 billion at December 31, 2014. The Company monitors concentrations of leases by manufacturer and vehicle  make and model.  As of
December 31, 2015, vehicle lease residuals related to sport utility vehicles were 36.4 percent of the portfolio, while auto and crossover vehicle classes represented approximately 32.7 percent and 20.0 percent of the portfolio, respectively. At
year-end 2015, the largest vehicle-type concentration represented 7.4 percent of the aggregate residual value of the vehicles in the portfolio. At December 31, 2015, the weighted-average origination term of the portfolio was 40 months, compared with
39 months at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, the commercial leasing portfolio had $511 million of residuals, compared with $543 million at December 31, 2014. At year-end 2015, lease residuals related to trucks and other transportation
equipment were 30.7 percent of the total residual portfolio. Business and office equipment represented 30.3 percent of the aggregate portfolio, and railcars represented 12.7 percent. No other concentrations of more than 10 percent existed at
December 31, 2015.     Operational Risk Management  Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or
systems, or from external events, including the risk of loss resulting from fraud, litigation and breaches in data security. The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems
to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of the Company s objectives. Business lines have direct and primary
responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business activities. The Company maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and
execution, proper system operations, proper oversight of third parties with whom it does business, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data.

Business continuation and disaster recovery planning is also critical to effectively managing operational
risks. Each business unit of the Company is required to develop, maintain and test these plans at least annually to ensure that recovery activities, if needed, can support mission critical functions, including technology, networks and data centers
supporting customer applications and business operations.    While the Company believes it has designed effective processes to minimize operational
risks, there is no absolute assurance that business disruption or operational losses would not occur from an external event or internal control breakdown. On an ongoing basis, management makes process changes and investments to enhance its systems
of internal controls and business continuity and disaster recovery plans.    In the past, the Company has experienced attack attempts on its computer
systems including various denial-of-service attacks on customer-facing websites. The Company has not experienced any material losses relating to these attempts, as a result of its controls, processes and systems to protect its networks, computers,
software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. However, attack attempts on the Company s computer systems are increasing and the Company continues to develop and enhance its controls and processes to protect against these
attempts.     Compliance Risk Management  The Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to reputation through
failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as administered by
the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and other requirements. The Company has controls and processes in place for the assessment, identification, monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks and issues.  
 The significant increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives over the past several years has substantially increased the importance of
the Company s compliance risk management personnel and activities. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has authority to prescribe rules, or issue orders or guidelines pursuant to any federal consumer
financial law. The CFPB regulates and examines the Company, its bank and other subsidiaries with respect to matters that relate to these laws and consumer financial services and products. The CFPB s rulemaking, examination and enforcement
authority increases enforcement risk in this area including the potential for fines and penalties. Refer to  Supervision and Regulation  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the regulatory framework
applicable to bank  

58       

holding companies and their subsidiaries, and the substantial changes to that regulation.     Interest Rate Risk
Management  In the banking industry, changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings, market valuations and safety and soundness of an entity. To manage the impact on net interest income and the market value of assets
and liabilities, the Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its Asset Liability Committee ( ALCO ) and approved by the Board of
Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. The Company uses net interest income simulation analysis and market value of equity modeling
for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk.      Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis   One of the primary tools used to measure interest
rate risk and the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income is simulation analysis. The monthly analysis incorporates substantially all of the Company s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, together with
forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the impact on net interest income of a 200 basis point ( bps ) upward or
downward gradual change of market interest rates over a one-year period. The simulation also estimates the effect of immediate and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 bps as well as the effect of immediate and sustained
flattening or steepening of the yield curve. This simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits
based on historical analysis, management s outlook and re-pricing strategies. These assumptions are validated on a periodic basis. A sensitivity analysis is provided for key variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed by the ALCO
monthly and are used to guide asset/liability management strategies.    Table 20 summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next
12 months of various potential interest rate changes. The Company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet, implementing certain pricing strategies for loans
and deposits and through the selection of derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies. The Company manages the overall interest rate risk profile within policy limits. The ALCO policy limits the estimated change in net
interest income in a gradual 200 bps rate change scenario to a

4.0 percent decline of forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company was within policy.  
   Market Value of Equity Modeling   The Company also manages interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value of equity modeling, which measures the degree
to which the market values of the Company s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will change given a change in interest rates. The valuation analysis is dependent upon certain key assumptions about the nature of assets and
liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Management estimates the average life and rate characteristics of asset and liability accounts based upon historical analysis and management s expectation of rate behavior. Wholesale prepayment
assumptions are based on several key factors, including but not limited to, age, loan term, product type and seasonality, as well as macroeconomic factors including unemployment, interest rates and commercial real estate price indices. These factors
are updated regularly based on historical experience and forward market expectations. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on many key variables, including, but not limited to, current and projected interest rates compared with underlying
contractual rates, the time since origination and period to next reset date if floating rate loans, and other factors including housing price indices and geography, which are updated regularly based on historical experience and forward market
expectations. The balance and pricing assumptions of deposits that have no stated maturity are based on historical performance, the competitive environment, customer behavior, and product mix. These assumptions are validated on a periodic basis. A
sensitivity analysis of key variables of the valuation analysis is provided to the ALCO monthly and is used to guide asset/liability management strategies.  
 Management measures the impact of changes in market interest rates under a number of scenarios, including immediate and sustained parallel shifts, and
flattening or steepening of the yield curve. The ALCO policy limits the change in the market value of equity in a 200 bps parallel rate shock to a 15.0 percent decline. A 200 bps increase would have resulted in a 5.8 percent decrease
in the market value of equity at December 31, 2015, compared with a 6.7 percent decrease at December 31, 2014. A 200 bps decrease, where possible given current rates, would have resulted in a 7.0 percent decrease in the market
value of equity at December 31, 2015, compared with a 7.1 percent decrease at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company was within policy.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks   To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital
to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes
primarily in the following ways:      

To convert fixed-rate debt from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments;        

To convert the cash flows associated with floating-rate loans and debt from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments;        

To mitigate changes in value of the Company s mortgage origination pipeline, funded MLHFS and MSRs;        

To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances; and        

To mitigate the volatility of the Company s investment in foreign businesses driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.    
 The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses or over-the-counter. In
addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers (customer-related positions). The Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-related
positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these
customer-related positions. The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes.    The Company does not designate all of the
derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the
Company enters into interest rate swaps, forward commitments to buy to-be-announced securities ( TBAs ), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs,
but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. The estimated net sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the MSRs and the related derivative instruments at December 31, 2015, to an immediate 25, 50 and
100 bps downward movement in interest rates would be a decrease of approximately $7 million, $24 million and $123 million, respectively. An immediate upward movement in interest rates at December 31, 2015 of 25, 50 and 100 bps
would

decrease the fair value of the MSRs and related derivative instruments by $2 million, $16 million and $33 million, respectively. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding MSRs.    Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell
residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $5.4 billion of forward commitments to sell, hedging
$2.1 billion of MLHFS and $4.1 billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments. The forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance
related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair value option for the MLHFS.    Derivatives
are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the Company based on the probability of counterparty default. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative
positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, where possible by requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest
rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps and forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty
credit risk.    For additional information on derivatives and hedging activities, refer to Notes 20 and 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.     Market Risk Management  In addition to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally related to
trading activities which support customers  strategies to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk and funding activities. For purposes of its internal capital adequacy assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from
its trading activities employing methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk. The Company s Market Risk Committee ( MRC ), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk management. The
MRC monitors and reviews the Company s trading positions and establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company uses a Value at Risk ( VaR ) approach to measure general market
risk. Theoretically, VaR represents  

60       

the statistical risk of loss the Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day time horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR for its trading businesses
measured at the ninety-ninth percentile using a one-year look-back period for distributions derived from past market data. The market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading
portfolios, principally those that affect its corporate bond trading business, foreign currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan trading business and municipal securities business. On average, the Company expects the one-day
VaR to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year for its trading businesses. The Company monitors the effectiveness of its risk programs by back-testing the performance of its VaR models, regularly updating the historical data used by
the VaR models and stress testing. If the Company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted.  
 The average, high, low and period-end VaR amounts for the Company s trading positions were as follows:  
   
   The Company did not experience any actual trading losses for its combined trading businesses that exceeded VaR during
2015 and 2014. The Company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its VaR models, including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not
necessarily occurred on the same date.    The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a
historical continuous one-year look-back period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the Company s trading portfolio. The period selected by the Company includes the significant market volatility of
the last four months of 2008.    The average, high, low and period-end Stressed VaR amounts for the Company s trading positions were as follows:  

Valuations of positions in the client derivatives and foreign currency transaction businesses are based
on standard cash flow or other valuation techniques using market-based assumptions. These valuations are compared to third party quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant variances are approved by the
Company s market risk management department. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading, loan trading and municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against third party prices, with
significant variances approved by the Company s risk management department.    The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging
activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the Historical Simulation method. The VaRs are measured at the ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. The
Company monitors the effectiveness of the models through back-testing, updating the data and regular validations. A three-year look-back period is used to obtain past market data for the models.  
 The average, high and low VaR amounts for the residential MLHFS and related hedges and the MSRs and related hedges were as follows:  
   
    Liquidity Risk Management  The Company s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the
Company s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities include
diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company s profitable operations, sound credit quality and strong capital position
have enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets.  
 The Company s Board of Directors approves the Company s liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee

61       

of the Company s Board of Directors oversees the Company s liquidity risk management process and approves the contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the Company s liquidity
policy and guidelines, and regularly assesses the Company s ability to meet funding requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market events.  
 The Company s liquidity policy requires it to maintain diversified wholesale funding sources to avoid maturity, name and market concentrations. The
Company operates a Grand Cayman branch for issuing Eurodollar time deposits. In addition, the Company has relationships with dealers to issue national market retail and institutional savings certificates and short-term and medium-term notes. The
Company also maintains a significant correspondent banking network and relationships. Accordingly, the Company has access to national federal funds, funding through repurchase agreements and sources of stable certificates of deposit and commercial
paper.    The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the
Company s access to diversified

sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These include cash at
the Federal Reserve Bank, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window. Unencumbered liquid assets in the Company s available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment
portfolios provide asset liquidity through the Company s ability to sell the securities or pledge and borrow against them. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of unencumbered available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities
totaled $92.4 billion, compared with $86.9 billion at December 31, 2014. Refer to Table 13 and  Balance Sheet Analysis  for further information on investment securities  maturities and trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced
by the Company s ability to pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. At December 31, 2015, the Company could have borrowed an additional $74.9 billion at the FHLB and Federal Reserve
Bank based on collateral available for additional borrowings.

The Company s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost
funding, while reducing the Company s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $300.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $282.7 billion at December 31, 2014. Refer to Table 14 and  Balance Sheet
Analysis  for further information on the Company s deposits.    Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term borrowings.
Long-term debt was $32.1 billion at December 31, 2015, and is an important funding source because of its multi-year borrowing structure. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the terms and
maturities of the Company s long-term debt issuances and  Balance Sheet Analysis  for discussion on long-term debt trends. Short-term borrowings were $27.9 billion at December 31, 2015, and supplement the Company s other
funding sources. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and  Balance Sheet Analysis  for information on the terms and trends of the Company s short-term borrowings.  
 The Company s ability to raise negotiated funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies  views of the Company s credit
quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Table 21 details the rating agencies  most recent assessments.    In addition to assessing liquidity
risk on a consolidated basis, the Company monitors the parent company s liquidity. The parent company s routine funding requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders, debt service, repurchases of
common stock and funds used for acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and capital

securities. The Company maintains sufficient funding to meet expected parent company obligations, without access to the wholesale funding markets or dividends from subsidiaries, for
12 months when forecasted payments of common stock dividends are included and 24 months assuming dividends were reduced to zero. The parent company currently has available funds considerably greater than the amounts required to satisfy
these conditions.    Under United States Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the parent company is classified as a  well-known seasoned
issuer,  which allows it to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity.  Well-known seasoned issuers  generally include those companies with outstanding common securities with a market value of at
least $700 million held by non-affiliated parties or those companies that have issued at least $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of non-convertible securities, other than common equity, in the last three years. However, the parent
company s ability to issue debt and other securities under a registration statement filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under these rules is limited by the debt issuance authority granted by the Company s Board
of Directors and/or the ALCO policy.    At December 31, 2015, parent company long-term debt outstanding was $11.5 billion, compared with
$13.2 billion at December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the maturity of $1.7 billion of medium-term notes. At December 31, 2015, there was $1.9 billion of parent company debt scheduled to mature in 2016. Future debt
maturities may be met through medium-term note and capital security issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as from parent company cash and cash equivalents.

TABLE 22    CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

      63       

Dividend payments to the Company by its subsidiary bank are subject to regulatory review and statutory
limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. In general, dividends to the parent company from its banking subsidiary are limited by rules which compare dividends to net income for regulatorily-defined periods. For further information,
see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    During 2014, U.S. banking regulators approved a final regulatory Liquidity
Coverage Ratio ( LCR ), requiring banks to maintain an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. The LCR requirement became effective for the Company
January 1, 2015, subject to certain transition provisions over the following two years to full implementation by January 1, 2017. At December 31, 2015, the Company was compliant with the fully implemented LCR requirement based on its
interpretation of the final U.S. LCR rule.      European Exposures   Certain European countries have experienced severe credit deterioration. The Company does
not hold sovereign debt of any European country, but may have indirect exposure to sovereign debt through its investments in, and transactions with, European banks. At December 31, 2015, the Company had investments in perpetual preferred stock
issued by European banks with an amortized cost totaling $22 million and unrealized losses totaling $1 million, compared with an amortized cost totaling $66 million and unrealized losses totaling $2 million, at December 31, 2014. The Company
also transacts with various European banks as counterparties to interest rate and foreign currency derivatives for its hedging and customer-related activities; however, none of these banks are domiciled in the countries experiencing the most
significant credit deterioration. These derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements. In addition, interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions are subject to collateral arrangements which significantly limit the
Company s exposure to loss as they generally require daily posting of collateral. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in a net receivable position with six banks in Europe, totaling $21 million. The Company was in a net payable position
to each of the other European banks.    The Company has not bought or sold credit protection on the debt of any European country or any company
domiciled in Europe, nor does it provide retail lending services in Europe. While the Company does not offer commercial lending services in Europe, it does provide financing to domestic multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers
in European countries and provides a limited number of corporate credit cards in Europe to existing Company customers. While further deterioration in economic

conditions in Europe could have a negative impact on these customers  revenues, it is unlikely that any effect on the overall credit-worthiness of these multinational corporations would be
significant to the Company.    The Company provides merchant processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly or through banking
affiliations in Europe. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited on a short-term basis with certain European banks. However, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any
bank based on institution-specific deposit limits. At December 31, 2015, the Company had an aggregate amount on deposit with European banks of approximately $2.0 billion, predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland.  
 The money market funds managed by a subsidiary of the Company do not have any investments in European sovereign debt, other than approximately $275
million at December 31, 2015 guaranteed by the country of Germany. Other than investments in banks in the countries of the Netherlands, France and Germany, those funds do not have any unsecured investments in banks domiciled in the Eurozone.
     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   Off-balance sheet arrangements include any contractual arrangements to which an unconsolidated entity is a party, under
which the Company has an obligation to provide credit or liquidity enhancements or market risk support. Off-balance sheet arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that provides
financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk support. The Company has not utilized private label asset securitizations as a source of funding.  
 Commitments to extend credit are legally binding and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Many of the Company s
commitments to extend credit expire without being drawn, and therefore, total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements or the Company s exposure to credit loss. Commitments to extend credit also include
consumer credit lines that are cancelable upon notification to the consumer. Total contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2015 were $279.6 billion. The Company also issues and confirms various types of letters of
credit, including standby and commercial. Total contractual amounts of letters of credit at December 31, 2015 were $13.3 billion. For more information on the Company s commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, refer to Note 23 in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    The Company s off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities primarily consist of
private investment  

64       

funds or partnerships that make equity investments, provide debt financing or support community-based investments in tax-advantaged projects. In addition to providing investment returns, these
arrangements in many cases assist the Company in complying with requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act. The investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other
tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified time periods. The entities in which the Company invests are generally considered variable interest entities ( VIEs ). The Company s recorded
net investment in these entities as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $2.8 billion.    The Company also has non-controlling financial
investments in private funds and partnerships considered VIEs. The Company s recorded investment in these entities was approximately $32 million at December 31, 2015, and the Company had unfunded commitments to invest an additional $15
million. For more information on the Company s interests in unconsolidated VIEs, refer to Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the Company to customers or other third parties requiring the Company to perform if certain conditions
exist or upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event, such as a scheduled payment to be made under contract. The Company s primary guarantees include commitments from securities lending activities in which indemnifications are
provided to customers; indemnification or buy-back provisions related to sales of loans and tax credit investments; merchant charge-back guarantees through the Company s involvement in providing merchant processing services; and minimum revenue
guarantee arrangements. For certain guarantees, the Company may have access to collateral to support the guarantee, or through the exercise of other recourse provisions, be able to offset some or all of any payments made under these guarantees.  
 The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, along with other Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks, have a contingent guarantee obligation to indemnify Visa
Inc. for potential losses arising from antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and MasterCard International. The indemnification by the Company and other Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks has no maximum amount. Refer to
Note 23 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding guarantees, other commitments, and contingent liabilities, including maximum potential future payments and current carrying amounts.

Capital Management  The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and
creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company continually assesses its business risks and capital position. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. To achieve its capital
goals, the Company employs a variety of capital management tools, including dividends, common share repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, common stock and other capital instruments.  
 On June 16, 2015, the Company announced its Board of Directors had approved a 4.1 percent increase in the Company s dividend rate per common
share, from $0.245 per quarter to $0.255 per quarter.    The Company repurchased approximately 52 million shares of its common stock in 2015,
compared with approximately 54 million shares in 2014. The average price paid for the shares repurchased in 2015 was $43.54 per share, compared with $41.65 per share in 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the approximate dollar value of shares
that may yet be purchased by the Company under the current Board of Directors approved authorization was $1.3 billion. For a more complete analysis of activities impacting shareholders  equity and capital management programs, refer to
Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders  equity was $46.1 billion at
December 31, 2015, compared with $43.5 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of corporate earnings, partially offset by dividends and common share repurchases.  
 Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions
from Basel I over the following four years to full implementation by January 1, 2018. Basel III includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets: a general standardized approach and more risk-sensitive advanced
approaches, with the Company s capital adequacy being evaluated against the methodology that is most restrictive. Under Basel III, banking regulators define minimum capital requirements for banks and financial services holding companies. These
requirements are expressed in the form of a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and tier 1 leverage ratio. The minimum required level for these ratios at December 31, 2015,
was 4.5 percent, 6.0 percent, 8.0 percent, and 4.0 percent, respectively. The Company targets its regulatory capital levels, at both the bank and bank holding company level, to exceed the  well-capitalized  threshold for these
ratios. At December 31, 2015, the minimum  well-capitalized  threshold for the common equity

65       

tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively. The
most recent notification from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency categorized the Company s bank subsidiary as  well-capitalized  under the FDIC Improvement Act prompt corrective action provisions that are applicable to all
banks. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the risk-based category of its covered subsidiary bank.  
 As an approved mortgage seller and servicer, U.S. Bank National Association, through its mortgage banking division, is required to maintain various
levels of shareholder s equity, as specified by various agencies, including the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Government National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National
Mortgage Association. At December 31, 2015, U.S. Bank National Association met these requirements.    Table 23 provides a summary of
statutory regulatory capital ratios in effect for the Company at December 31, 2015 and 2014.    During 2014, U.S. banking regulators approved a
final regulatory Supplementary Leverage Ratio ( SLR ) requirement

for banks calculating capital adequacy using advanced approaches under Basel III. The SLR is defined as tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure, which includes both on- and
off-balance sheet exposures. At December 31, 2015, the Company s SLR exceeds the applicable minimum SLR requirement effective January 1, 2018.  
 The Company believes certain capital ratios in addition to statutory regulatory capital ratios are useful in evaluating its capital adequacy. The
Company s tangible common equity, as a percent of tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets calculated under the transitional standardized approach, was 7.6 percent and 9.2 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2015,
compared with 7.5 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2014. The Company s common equity tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was
9.1 percent at December 31, 2015, compared with 9.0 percent at December 31, 2014. The Company s common equity tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio using the Basel III advanced approaches as if fully implemented was
11.9 percent at December 31, 2015, compared with 11.8 percent at December 31, 2014. Refer to  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for further information regarding the calculation of these ratios.

   FOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY     The
Company reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, or $0.80 per diluted common share, compared with $1.5 billion, or $0.79 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2014. Return on
average assets and return on average common equity were 1.41 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with 1.50 percent and 14.4 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2014.  
 Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis for the fourth quarter of 2015, was $42 million (0.8 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of
2014, reflecting a 2.6 percent increase in net interest income, partially offset by a 1.3 percent decrease in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income from the fourth quarter of 2014 was the result of growth in average earning
assets, partially offset by a continued shift in loan portfolio mix. Noninterest income decreased from a year ago primarily due to the impact of the fourth quarter 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by fee revenue growth and the HSA deposit sale.

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2015 was higher than the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily
due to increases in compensation and employee benefits expenses and other costs related to risk and compliance activities, partially offset by lower charitable contributions and the impact of prior year legal accruals.  
 Fourth quarter 2015 net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was $2.9 billion, compared with $2.8 billion in the fourth
quarter of 2014. The $72 million (2.6 percent) increase was principally the result of growth in average earning assets, partially offset by a continued shift in loan portfolio mix. Average earning assets were $18.1 billion (5.1
percent) higher in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by increases of $10.3 billion (4.2 percent) in loans and $7.4 billion (7.5 percent) in investment securities. The net interest margin, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 3.06 percent, compared with 3.14 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting a change in the loan portfolio mix, as well as growth in the investment portfolio at lower average
rates and lower reinvestment rates on investment securities.  

67       

TABLE 24    FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS  

(a)  
  Interest and rates are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis utilizing a tax rate of 35 percent.     
    
  Noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $2.3 billion, compared with $2.4 billion in the
same period of 2014, representing a decrease of $30 million (1.3 percent). The decrease was due to the impact of the fourth quarter 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by fee revenue growth and the HSA deposit sale. The fee revenue growth
reflected higher credit and debit card revenue, trust and investment management fees and merchant processing services revenue, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue, primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of
MSRs, net of hedging activities. Credit and debit card revenue increased $22 million (8.1 percent) over the fourth quarter of 2014, due to higher transaction volumes. Trust and investment management fees increased $14 million (4.3 percent),
reflecting the benefits of the Company s investments in its corporate trust and fund services businesses, as well as account growth, improved market conditions and lower fee waivers. Merchant processing services revenue increased $9 million
(2.3 percent) as a result of higher transaction volumes, along with account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip card technology requirements. Adjusted for the approximate $16

million impact of foreign currency rate changes, year-over- year merchant processing services growth would have been approximately 6.5 percent.  
 Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $2.8 billion, or $5 million (0.2 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Compensation
expense increased $61 million (5.3 percent), reflecting the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities, while employee benefits expense was $27 million (11.0 percent) higher, mainly due to increased pension
costs. Offsetting these increases was a $33 million (25.6 percent) decline in marketing and business development expense, principally due to charitable contributions in the fourth quarter of 2014, and a $35 million (6.4 percent) decline in other
noninterest expense, reflecting the impact of fourth quarter 2014 legal accruals partially offset by higher compliance-related expenses.    The
provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $305 million, an increase of $17 million (5.9 percent) from the same period of 2014. The provision for credit losses was equal to net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of
2015 and $20 million lower than net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net charge-offs were $305 million

68       

in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $308 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.    The
provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted in an effective tax rate of 27.2 percent, compared with an effective tax rate of 25.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2014.  
  LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW     The Company s major lines of business
are Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate, Consumer and Small Business Banking, Wealth Management and Securities Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about
which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.     Basis for Financial
Presentation  Business line results are derived from the Company s business unit profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense.
The allowance for credit losses and related provision expense are allocated to the lines of business based on the related loan balances managed. Goodwill and other intangible assets are assigned to the lines of business based on the mix of business
of the acquired entity. Within the Company, capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is allocated to the operating segments to support evaluation of business performance. Business lines are allocated capital on a
risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements. Generally, the determination of the amount of capital allocated to each business line includes credit and operational capital allocations following a Basel III
regulatory framework. Interest income and expense is determined based on the assets and liabilities managed by the business line. Because funding and asset liability management is a central function, funds transfer-pricing methodologies are utilized
to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to all business line assets and liabilities, respectively, using a

matched funding concept. Also, each business unit is allocated the taxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt products. The residual effect on net interest income of asset/liability management
activities is included in Treasury and Corporate Support. Noninterest income and expenses directly managed by each business line, including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within
each segment s financial results in a manner similar to the consolidated financial statements. Occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the lines of business. Generally, operating losses are charged to the line of
business when the loss event is realized in a manner similar to a loan charge-off. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line s operations are charged to the
applicable business line based on its utilization of those services, primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within
noninterest expense. Certain activities that do not directly support the operations of the lines of business or for which the lines of business are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance are not charged to the lines
of business. The income or expenses associated with these corporate activities is reported within the Treasury and Corporate Support line of business. Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a standard tax rate with the residual tax
expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.    Designations, assignments and
allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company s diverse customer base. During 2015, certain
organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, 2014 results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.

Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate  Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate offers lending, equipment
finance and small-ticket leasing, depository services, treasury management, capital markets, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and
public sector clients. Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate contributed $884 million of the Company s net income in 2015, or a decrease of $208 million (19.0 percent) compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by a higher
provision for credit losses, higher noninterest expense and lower net revenue.    Net revenue decreased $71 million (2.4 percent) in 2015,
compared with 2014. Noninterest income decreased $75 million (7.8 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, driven by higher loan-related charges, partially offset by higher loan syndication and bond underwriting fees, as well as higher commercial
leasing revenue. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $4 million (0.2 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, driven by increases in average loans and deposits, partially offset by lower rates and fees on loans.  
 Noninterest expense increased $71 million (5.8 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily resulting from higher compensation expense due to
higher variable compensation and merit increases, higher benefits expense due to increased pension costs, an increase in the FDIC insurance assessment allocation based on increased loan volumes, and higher net shared services expense. The provision
for credit losses increased $184 million in 2015, compared with 2014, due to an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation driven by a decline in energy prices and an increase in net charge-offs. Nonperforming assets were $168 million at
December 31, 2015, compared with $170 million at December 31, 2014. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of period-end loans were 0.19 percent at December 31, 2015, compared with 0.21 percent at December 31, 2014. Refer
to the  Corporate Risk Profile  section for further information on factors impacting the credit quality of the loan portfolios.     Consumer and Small
Business Banking  Consumer and Small Business Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM processing and mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablet
computers. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking and indirect lending, as well as mortgage banking. Consumer and Small Business Banking contributed $1.4 billion of the Company s net income in 2015, or a decrease of $129 million
(8.7 percent), compared with 2014. The decrease was due to

lower net revenue and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses.  
 Net revenue decreased $204 million (2.8 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased
$100 million (2.1 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily due to lower rates on loans and lower loan fees due to the wind down of the CAA product, partially offset by higher average loan, deposit and loans held for sale
balances. Noninterest income decreased $104 million (4.0 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily the result of lower mortgage banking revenue due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of MSRs, net of hedging activities, partially offset
by higher mortgage production revenue. Noninterest expense increased $266 million (5.8 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, the result of higher compensation, employee benefits and mortgage servicing-related expenses.  
 The provision for credit losses decreased $266 million (67.7 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, due to lower net charge-offs and a favorable
change in the reserve allocation driven by improvements in the mortgage portfolio. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs decreased to 0.25 percent in 2015, compared with 0.38 percent in 2014. Nonperforming assets were
$1.3 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $1.4 billion at December 31, 2014. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of period-end loans were 0.95 percent at December 31, 2015, compared with 1.10 percent at December 31,
2014. Refer to the  Corporate Risk Profile  section for further information on factors impacting the credit quality of the loan portfolios.     Wealth
Management and Securities Services  Wealth Management and Securities Services provides private banking, financial advisory services, investment management, retail brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing through five
businesses: Wealth Management, Corporate Trust Services, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management, Institutional Trust   Custody and Fund Services. Wealth Management and Securities Services contributed $257 million of the Company s
net income in 2015, an increase of $6 million (2.4 percent), compared with 2014. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to higher net revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.  
 Net revenue increased $73 million (4.1 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, driven by a $70 million (5.0 percent) increase in noninterest income,
reflecting the impact of account growth, improved market conditions and lower fee waivers. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $3 million (0.8 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, principally due to higher average loan and
deposit  

72       

balances, partially offset by a lower loan rates and a decrease in the margin benefit of corporate trust deposits.  
 Noninterest expense increased $72 million (5.2 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to
higher net shared services expense and higher compensation and employee benefits expenses primarily due to merit increases and increased pension costs, respectively.  
  Payment Services  Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing card services,
consumer lines of credit and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $1.2 billion of the Company s net income in 2015, or an increase of $22 million (1.9 percent) compared with 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher net
revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses.    Net revenue increased $260 million (5.2
percent) in 2015, compared with 2014. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $181 million (10.3 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily driven by improved loan rates and higher average loan balances and fees.
Noninterest income increased $79 million (2.4 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily due to an increase in credit and debit card revenue on higher transaction volumes, along with higher merchant processing services revenue, driven by
increased transaction volumes and product fees and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip card technology requirements, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency rate changes.  
 Noninterest expense increased $210 million (8.6 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily due to higher net shared services and compensation and
marketing expenses. The provision for credit losses increased $21 million (2.7 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily due to an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation due to loan growth. As a percentage of average loans outstanding,
net charge-offs were 3.01 percent in 2015, compared with 3.11 percent in 2014.     Treasury and Corporate Support  Treasury and Corporate Support includes the
Company s investment portfolios, most covered commercial and commercial real estate loans and related OREO, funding, capital management, interest rate risk management, income taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most investments
in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded net income of $2.2 billion in 2015, compared with
$1.9 billion in 2014.  
 
  Net revenue increased $87 million (2.9 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014. Net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, increased $129 million (6.1 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, principally due to growth in the investment securities portfolio. Noninterest income decreased $42 million (4.6 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014,
primarily due to lower other income from Visa stock sales, the 2015 student loan market adjustment and the 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by the 2015 HSA deposit sale gain and higher commercial products revenue.  
 Noninterest expense decreased $403 million (37.1 percent) in 2015, compared with 2014, principally due to a reduction of reserves for losses allocated
to the business lines, lower costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects, the 2014 FHA DOJ settlement and lower charitable contributions, partially offset by higher compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases and
staffing for risk and compliance activities, and higher employee benefits expense, reflecting higher pension costs.    Income taxes are assessed to
each line of business at a managerial tax rate of 36.4 percent with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.  
  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES     In addition to capital ratios defined by banking
regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:      

Tangible common equity to tangible assets,        

Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets,        

Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets estimated for the Basel III fully implemented standardized approach, and    

Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets estimated for the Basel III fully implemented advanced approaches.    
 These measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market or
economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company s capital position relative to other financial services companies. These measures differ from currently
effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the numerator includes unrealized gains and losses related to available-for-sale securities and excludes preferred securities, including preferred stock, the nature and
extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These measures are not defined in

73       

generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), or are not currently effective or defined in federal banking regulations. As a result, these measures disclosed by the Company may be
considered non-GAAP financial measures.  
 
  There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages
readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.

The following table shows the Company s
calculation of these Non-GAAP financial measures:      

(1)  
  Includes goodwill related to certain investments in unconsolidated financial institutions per prescribed regulatory requirements beginning March 31, 2014.     

(2)  
  Includes net losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and other adjustments.     

(4)  
  December 31, 2015 and 2014, calculated under the Basel III transitional standardized approach; all other periods calculated under Basel I.     

(5)  
  Includes higher risk-weighting for unfunded loan commitments, investment securities, residential mortgages, MSRs and other adjustments.     

(6)  
  Primarily reflects higher risk-weighting for MSRs.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES     Note 2 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses accounting standards recently issued but not yet required to be adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards
materially affects the Company s financial condition or results of operations, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section(s) of the Management s Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES     The accounting and reporting policies of the
Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. The Company s financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding the Company s financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those
policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are not
considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements. These factors include, among other things, whether the
estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information (including third party sources or available prices), sensitivity of the estimates to changes in
economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under GAAP. Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the Company s Audit Committee.  
 Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those policies considered to be critical
accounting policies are described below.     Allowance for Credit Losses  The allowance for credit losses is established to provide for probable losses incurred in
the Company s credit portfolio. The methods utilized to estimate the allowance for credit losses, key assumptions and quantitative and qualitative information considered by management in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses
are discussed in the  Credit Risk Management  section.

Management s evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of
all the accounting estimates for a banking institution. It is an inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed throughout the Management s Discussion and Analysis section of the Annual Report. Although methodologies
utilized to determine each element of the allowance reflect management s assessment of credit risk as identified through assessments completed of individual credits and of homogenous pools affected by material credit events, degrees of
imprecision exist in these measurement tools due in part to subjective judgments involved and an inherent lagging of credit quality measurements relative to the stage of the business cycle. Even determining the stage of the business cycle is highly
subjective. As discussed in the  Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses  section, management considers the effect of changes in economic conditions, risk management practices, and other factors that contribute to
imprecision of loss estimates in determining the allowance for credit losses. If not considered, incurred losses in the portfolio related to imprecision and other subjective factors could have a dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and financial
viability of a banking institution.    Given the many subjective factors affecting the credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for credit losses
may not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is in part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation to changes in the business cycle, the exposure and mix
of loans within risk rating categories, levels of nonperforming loans and the timing of charge-offs and recoveries. For example, the amount of loans within specific risk ratings may change, providing a leading indicator of changing credit quality,
while nonperforming loans and net charge-offs may be slower to reflect changes. Also, inherent loss ratios, determined through migration analysis and historical loss performance over the estimated business cycle of a loan, may not change to the same
degree as net charge-offs. Because risk ratings and inherent loss ratios primarily drive the allowance specifically allocated to commercial lending segment loans, the degree of change in the commercial lending allowance may differ from the level of
changes in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Also, management would maintain an appropriate allowance for credit losses by increasing allowance rates during periods of economic uncertainty or changes in the business cycle.  
 Some factors considered in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses are quantifiable while other factors require qualitative judgment.
Management conducts an analysis with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of inherent losses, and utilizes this analysis along with

75       

qualitative factors that can affect the precision of credit loss estimates, including economic conditions, such as changes in unemployment or bankruptcy rates, and concentration risks, such as
risks associated with specific industries, the housing market, and loans to highly leveraged enterprises, in determining the overall level of the allowance for credit losses. The Company s determination of the allowance for commercial lending
segment loans is sensitive to the assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates at December 31, 2015. In the event that 10 percent of period ending loan balances (including unfunded commitments) within each risk category of this
segment of the loan portfolio experienced downgrades of two risk categories, the allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately $236 million at December 31, 2015. The Company believes the allowance for credit losses
appropriately considers the imprecision in estimating credit losses based on credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates but actual losses may differ from those estimates. In the event that inherent loss or estimated loss rates for commercial
lending segment loans increased by 10 percent, the allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately $158 million at December 31, 2015. The Company s determination of the allowance for consumer lending segment loans is
sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates and estimated impairments on restructured loans. In the event that estimated losses for this segment of the loan portfolio increased by 10 percent, the allowance for credit losses would increase by
approximately $183 million at December 31, 2015. Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and
extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses. They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and inherent losses and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk rating or
loss rates. Given current processes employed by the Company, management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach
different reasonable conclusions that could be significant to the Company s financial statements. Refer to the  Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses  section for further information.  
  Fair Value Estimates  A portion of the Company s assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in fair value
recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These include all of the

Company s available-for-sale investment securities, derivatives and other trading instruments, MSRs and MLHFS. The estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale, which are
recorded at the lower-of-cost-or-fair value. The determination of fair value is important for certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates including goodwill and other intangible assets, impaired
loans, OREO and other repossessed assets.    Fair value is generally defined as the exit price at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing, unrelated parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Fair value is based on quoted market prices in an active market, or if market prices are not available, is estimated using models employing
techniques such as matrix pricing or discounting expected cash flows. The significant assumptions used in the models, which include assumptions for interest rates, discount rates, prepayments and credit losses, are independently verified against
observable market data where possible. Where observable market data is not available, the estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of judgment. In this circumstance, fair value is estimated based on management s
judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset or liability. This valuation process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount recorded
on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income (loss).    When available,
trading and available-for-sale securities are valued based on quoted market prices. However, certain securities are traded less actively and therefore, quoted market prices may not be available. The determination of fair value may require
benchmarking to similar instruments or performing a discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of future cash flows and prepayment, interest and default rates. An example is non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. For more information
on investment securities, refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    As few derivative contracts are listed on an
exchange, the majority of the Company s derivative positions are valued using valuation techniques that use readily observable market inputs. Certain derivatives, however, must be valued using techniques that include unobservable inputs. For
these instruments, the significant assumptions must be estimated and therefore, are subject to judgment. Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of the Company s derivative positions.  
 Refer to Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding estimations of fair value.

76       

Purchased Loans and Related Indemnification Assets  In accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance
effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009, all purchased loans and related indemnification assets arising from loss-sharing arrangements with the FDIC are recorded at fair value at date of purchase. The initial valuation of these
loans and the related indemnification assets requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates about how the acquired loans will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis and
independent third party appraisals. Factors that may significantly affect the initial valuation include, among others, market-based and industry data related to expected changes in interest rates, assumptions related to probability and severity of
credit losses, estimated timing of credit losses including the foreclosure and liquidation of collateral, expected prepayment rates, required or anticipated loan modifications, unfunded loan commitments, the specific terms and provisions of any loss
sharing agreements, and specific industry and market conditions that may impact discount rates and independent third party appraisals.    On an
ongoing basis, the accounting for purchased loans and related indemnification assets follows applicable authoritative accounting guidance for purchased non-impaired loans and purchased impaired loans. Refer to Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, refer to the  Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses  section for information on the determination of the required allowance for credit
losses, if any, for these loans.     Mortgage Servicing Rights  MSRs are capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained, or may be
purchased from others. The Company records MSRs at fair value. Because MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, the Company determines the fair value by estimating the present value of the asset s future cash flows
utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates, and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and independent third party valuations. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recorded in earnings
during the period in which they occur. Risks inherent in the MSRs  valuation include higher than expected prepayment rates and/or delayed receipt of cash flows. The Company may utilize derivatives, including interest rate swaps, forward
commitments to buy TBAs, and futures and options contracts, to mitigate the valuation risk. Refer to Notes 10 and 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the assumptions used in determining the fair value
of MSRs and an analysis of the sensitivity to

changes in interest rates of the fair value of the MSRs portfolio and the related derivative instruments used to mitigate the valuation risk.  
  Goodwill and Other Intangibles  The Company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangibles, at fair
value. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. In certain situations, interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair
value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible
inability to realize the carrying amount.    The initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets and subsequent impairment analysis
require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis. Additionally, estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten
years and, by their nature, are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, changes in revenue growth
trends, cost structures, technology, changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions. In determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates, the Company reviews historical performance of the underlying assets or similar
assets in an effort to assess and validate assumptions utilized in its estimates.    In assessing the fair value of reporting units, the Company
considers the stage of the current business cycle and potential changes in market conditions in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows. Also, management often utilizes other information to validate the reasonableness of its
valuations, including public market comparables, and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Valuation multiples may be based on revenue, price-to-earnings and tangible capital ratios of comparable public companies and
business segments. These multiples may be adjusted to consider competitive differences, including size, operating leverage and other factors. The carrying amount of a reporting unit is determined based on the amount of equity required for the
reporting unit s activities, considering the specific assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The Company determines the amount of equity for each reporting unit on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital
requirements, and includes deductions  

77       

and limitations related to certain types of assets including MSRs, purchased credit card relationship intangibles, and capital markets activity in the Company s Wholesale Banking and
Commercial Real Estate segment. The Company does not assign corporate assets and liabilities to reporting units that do not relate to the operations of the reporting unit or are not considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit.
These assets and liabilities primarily relate to the Company s investment securities portfolio and other investments (including direct equity investments, bank-owned life insurance and tax-advantaged investments) and corporate debt and other
funding liabilities. In the most recent goodwill impairment test, the portion of the Company s total equity allocated to the Treasury and Corporate Support operating segment included approximately $3 billion in excess of the economic and
regulatory capital requirements of that segment.    The Company s annual assessment of potential goodwill impairment was completed during the
second quarter of 2015. Based on the results of this assessment, no goodwill impairment was recognized. The Company continues to monitor goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment indicators throughout the year.  
  Income Taxes  The Company estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which it operates, including
federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and an insignificant amount to foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Accrued taxes are reported in other assets or other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and
liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions
that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized
upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, the Company assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax

treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and
subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions regarding the estimated amounts of accrued taxes.  
 Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being
conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the
operating results of the Company. Refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     Under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )). Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.    During the most recently completed fiscal
quarter, there was no change made in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting.    The annual report of the Company s management on internal control over financial
reporting is provided on page 79. The attestation report of Ernst   Young LLP, the Company s independent accountants, regarding the Company s internal control over financial reporting is provided on page 81.

78       

Report of Management   
 Responsibility for the financial statements and other information presented throughout this Annual Report rests with the management of U.S. Bancorp. The Company
believes the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and present the substance of transactions based on the circumstances and management s best
estimates and judgment.    In meeting its responsibilities for the reliability of the financial statements, management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as defined by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company s system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of publicly filed financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  
 To test compliance, the Company carries out an extensive audit program. This program includes a review for compliance with written policies and procedures and a
comprehensive review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal control. Although control procedures are designed and tested, it must be recognized that there are limits inherent in all systems of internal control and, therefore,
errors and irregularities may nevertheless occur. Also, estimates and judgments are required to assess and balance the relative cost and expected benefits of the controls. Projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
 The Board of Directors of the Company has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are independent of U.S. Bancorp. The Audit Committee meets periodically with
management, the internal auditors and the independent accountants to consider audit results and to discuss internal accounting control, auditing and financial reporting matters.  
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes the Company
designed and maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.    The Company s independent accountants,
Ernst   Young LLP, have been engaged to render an independent professional opinion on the financial statements and issue an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Their opinion on the financial
statements appearing on page 80 and their attestation on internal control over financial reporting appearing on page 81 are based on procedures conducted in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States).

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   
 The Board of Directors and Shareholders of U.S. Bancorp:    We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Bancorp as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of U.S. Bancorp s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of U.S. Bancorp at
December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), U.S. Bancorp s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated
February 25, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   
  on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting     The Board of Directors and
Shareholders of U.S. Bancorp:    We have audited U.S. Bancorp s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria
established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). U.S. Bancorp s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on U.S. Bancorp s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.    We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.    A
company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.    Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.    In our opinion, U.S. Bancorp maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.    We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Bancorp as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders 
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 and our report dated February 25, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTE 1    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

U.S. Bancorp is a multi-state financial services holding company headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) provide a full range of financial services, including lending and depository services through banking offices principally in the Midwest and West regions of the United States. The
Company also engages in credit card, merchant, and ATM processing, mortgage banking, insurance, trust and investment management, brokerage, and leasing activities, principally in domestic markets.  
  Basis of Presentation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and all variable interest entities
( VIEs ) for which the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the VIE that
could potentially be significant to the VIE. Consolidation eliminates all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Certain items in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  
  Uses of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual experience could differ from those estimates.  
  BUSINESS SEGMENTS     Within the Company, financial performance is measured by
major lines of business based on the products and services provided to customers through its distribution channels. The Company has five reportable operating segments:  
  Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate  Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository
services, treasury management, capital markets, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients.  
  Consumer and Small Business Banking  Consumer and Small Business Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales,
on-line services, direct mail, ATM processing and mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablet computers. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking and indirect lending, as well as mortgage banking.

Wealth Management and Securities Services  Wealth Management and Securities Services provides private banking,
financial advisory services, investment management, retail brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing through five businesses: Wealth Management, Corporate Trust Services, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management, Institutional
Trust   Custody and Fund Services.     Payment Services  Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit
cards, corporate, government and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit and merchant processing.     Treasury and Corporate Support  Treasury and
Corporate Support includes the Company s investment portfolios, most covered commercial and commercial real estate loans and related other real estate owned ( OREO ), funding, capital management, interest rate risk management, income
taxes not allocated to business lines, including most investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis.  
  Segment Results  Accounting policies for the lines of business are the same as those used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements with respect to
activities specifically attributable to each business line. However, the preparation of business line results requires management to allocate funding costs and benefits, expenses and other financial elements to each line of business. For details of
these methodologies and segment results, see  Basis for Financial Presentation  and Table 25  Line of Business Financial Performance  included in Management s Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated by reference into
these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     SECURITIES     Realized
gains or losses on securities are determined on a trade date basis based on the specific amortized cost of the investments sold.     Trading Securities  Debt and
equity securities held for resale are classified as trading securities and are included in other assets and reported at fair value. Changes in fair value and realized gains or losses are reported in noninterest income.  
  Available-for-sale Securities  These securities are not trading securities but may be sold before maturity in response to changes in the Company s interest
rate risk profile, funding needs, demand for collateralized deposits by public entities or

88       

other reasons. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized net gains or losses reported within other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders  equity. Declines
in fair value for credit-related other-than-temporary impairment, if any, are reported in noninterest income.     Held-to-maturity Securities  Debt securities for
which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Declines in fair value for credit-related other-than-temporary impairment, if
any, are reported in noninterest income.     Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase  Securities
purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions with a receivable or payable recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold,
plus accrued interest. Collateral requirements are continually monitored and additional collateral is received or provided as required. The Company records a receivable or payable for cash collateral paid or received.  
  EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING ENTITIES     Equity investments in public
entities in which the Company s ownership is less than 20 percent are generally accounted for as available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair value. Similar investments in private entities are accounted for using the cost method.
Investments in entities where the Company has a significant influence (generally between 20 percent and 50 percent ownership), but does not control the entity, are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in limited partnerships
and limited liability companies where the Company s ownership interest is greater than 5 percent are accounted for using the equity method. All equity investments are evaluated for impairment at least annually and more frequently if
certain criteria are met.     LOANS     The Company offers a broad array of
lending products and categorizes its loan portfolio into three segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Company s three loan portfolio segments
are commercial lending, consumer lending and covered loans. The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending segment are
commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The three

classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans. The covered loan segment consists of only one class.  
 The Company s accounting methods for loans differ depending on whether the loans are originated or purchased, and for purchased loans, whether the
loans were acquired at a discount related to evidence of credit deterioration since date of origination.     Originated Loans Held for Investment  Loans the
Company originates as held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income, net deferred loan fees or costs, and any direct principal charge-offs. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balances as
earned. Loan and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized over the life of the loan and/or commitment period as yield adjustments.  
  Purchased Loans  All purchased loans (non-impaired and impaired) acquired after January 1, 2009 are initially measured at fair value as of the acquisition date
in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value. An allowance for credit losses is not recorded at the acquisition date for loans purchased after January 1, 2009.
In accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance, purchased non-impaired loans acquired in a business combination prior to January 1, 2009 were generally recorded at the predecessor s carrying value including an allowance
for credit losses.    In determining the acquisition date fair value of purchased impaired loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Company generally
aggregates purchased consumer loans and certain smaller balance commercial loans into pools of loans with common risk characteristics, while accounting for larger balance commercial loans individually. Expected cash flows at the purchase date in
excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable. Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash flows over those expected at
the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively. The present value of any decreases in expected cash flows, other than from decreases in variable interest rates, after the purchase date is recognized by recording an allowance for
credit losses. Revolving loans, including lines of credit and credit cards loans, and leases are excluded from purchased impaired loans accounting.  
 For purchased loans acquired after January 1, 2009 that are not deemed impaired at acquisition, credit discounts representing the principal losses
expected over the life of the loan are a component of the initial fair value. Subsequent to

89       

the purchase date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for credit losses for these loans is similar to originated loans; however, the Company records a provision for credit
losses only when the required allowance exceeds any remaining credit discounts. The remaining differences between the purchase price and the unpaid principal balance at the date of acquisition are recorded in interest income over the life of the
loans.     Covered Assets  Loans covered under loss sharing or similar credit protection agreements with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
( FDIC ) are reported in loans along with the related indemnification asset. Foreclosed real estate covered under similar agreements is recorded in other assets. In accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance effective for
the Company beginning January 1, 2009, all purchased loans and related indemnification assets are recorded at fair value at the date of purchase.  
 Effective January 1, 2013, the Company amortizes any reduction in expected cash flows from the FDIC resulting from increases in expected cash flows
from the covered assets (when there are no previous valuation allowances to reverse) over the shorter of the remaining contractual term of the indemnification agreements or the remaining life of the covered assets. Prior to January 1, 2013, the
Company considered such increases in expected cash flows of purchased loans and decreases in expected cash flows of the FDIC indemnification assets together and recognized them over the remaining life of the loans.  
  Commitments to Extend Credit  Unfunded commitments for residential mortgage loans intended to be held for sale are considered derivatives and recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in income. All other unfunded loan commitments are not considered derivatives and are not reported on the balance sheet. For loans purchased after January 1, 2009, the fair value
of the unfunded credit commitments is generally considered in the determination of the fair value of the loans recorded at the date of acquisition. Reserves for credit exposure on all other unfunded credit commitments are recorded in other
liabilities.     Allowance for Credit Losses  The allowance for credit losses reserves for probable and estimable losses incurred in the Company s loan and
lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, and includes certain amounts that do not represent loss exposure to the Company because those losses are recoverable under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. The allowance for credit losses
is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge-offs. Management evaluates the allowance each quarter to ensure it appropriately reserves for incurred losses.

The allowance recorded for loans in the commercial lending segment is based on reviews of individual
credit relationships and considers the migration analysis of commercial lending segment loans and actual loss experience. In the migration analysis applied to risk rated loan portfolios, the Company currently examines up to a 15-year period of loss
experience. For each loan type, this historical loss experience is adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices or economic conditions. The
results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm an appropriate historical time frame is selected for each commercial loan type. The allowance recorded for impaired loans greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is
based on an individual loan analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent
loans, rather than the migration analysis. The allowance recorded for all other commercial lending segment loans is determined on a homogenous pool basis and includes consideration of product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy
experience, portfolio growth and historical losses, adjusted for current trends. The Company also considers the impacts of any loan modifications made to commercial lending segment loans and any subsequent payment defaults to its expectations of
cash flows, principal balance, and current expectations about the borrower s ability to pay in determining the allowance for credit losses.  
 The allowance recorded for Troubled Debt Restructuring ( TDR ) loans and purchased impaired loans in the consumer lending segment is
determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool, or the prior quarter effective rate, respectively. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans in the consumer
lending segment is determined based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. The allowance recorded for all other consumer lending segment loans is determined on a homogenous pool basis and includes consideration of product mix, risk
characteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy experience, delinquency status, refreshed loan-to-value ratios when possible, portfolio growth and historical losses, adjusted for current trends. The Company also considers any modifications made to
consumer lending segment loans including the impacts of any subsequent payment defaults since modification in determining the allowance for credit losses, such as the borrower s ability to pay under the restructured terms, and the timing and
amount of payments.  

90       

The allowance for the covered loan segment is evaluated each quarter in a manner similar to that
described for non-covered loans and reflects decreases in expected cash flows of those loans after the acquisition date. The provision for credit losses for covered loans considers the indemnification provided by the FDIC.  
 In addition, subsequent payment defaults on loan modifications considered TDRs are considered in the underlying factors used in the determination of the
appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. For each loan segment, the Company estimates future loan charge-offs through a variety of analysis, trends and underlying assumptions. With respect to the commercial lending segment, TDRs may be
collectively evaluated for impairment where observed performance history, including defaults, is a primary driver of the loss allocation. For commercial TDRs individually evaluated for impairment, attributes of the borrower are the primary factors
in determining the allowance for credit losses. However, historical loss experience is also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this category of loans. With respect to the consumer lending segment, performance of the portfolio,
including defaults on TDRs, is considered when estimating future cash flows.    The Company s methodology for determining the appropriate
allowance for credit losses for each loan segment also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used. As a result, in addition to the amounts determined under the methodologies described above, management also considers the potential
impact of other qualitative factors which include, but are not limited to, economic factors; geographic and other concentration risks; delinquency and nonaccrual trends; current business conditions; changes in lending policy, underwriting standards,
internal review and other relevant business practices; and the regulatory environment. The consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the Company s allowance for credit losses for each of the above loan
segments.    The Company also assesses the credit risk associated with off-balance sheet loan commitments, letters of credit, and derivatives. Credit
risk associated with derivatives is reflected in the fair values recorded for those positions. The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposure related to loan commitments and other credit guarantees is included in other liabilities. Because
business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments.  
  Credit Quality  The quality of the Company s loan portfolios is assessed as a function of net credit losses, levels of

nonperforming assets and delinquencies, and credit quality ratings as defined by the Company.  
 For all loan classes, loans are considered past due based on the number of days delinquent except for monthly amortizing loans which are classified
delinquent based upon the number of contractually required payments not made (for example, two missed payments is considered 30 days delinquent). When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is reversed.  
 Commercial lending segment loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and interest has become 90 days past due or
is otherwise considered doubtful. Commercial lending segment loans are generally fully or partially charged down to the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, less costs to sell, when the loan is considered uncollectible.  
 Consumer lending segment loans are generally charged-off at a specific number of days or payments past due. Residential mortgages and other retail loans
secured by 1-4 family properties are generally charged down to the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, less costs to sell, at 180 days past due, and placed on nonaccrual status in instances where a partial charge-off occurs unless the
loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans and lines in a junior lien position secured by 1-4 family properties are placed on nonaccrual status at 120 days past due or when behind a first lien that has become 180 days or greater
past due or placed on nonaccrual status. Any secured consumer lending segment loan whose borrower has had debt discharged through bankruptcy, for which the loan amount exceeds the fair value of the collateral, is charged down to the fair value of
the related collateral and the remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual status. Credit card loans continue to accrue interest until the account is charged off. Credit cards are charged off at 180 days past due. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4
family properties are charged-off at 120 days past due; and revolving consumer lines are charged off at 180 days past due. Similar to credit cards, other retail loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status because of the relative short period
of time to charge-off. Certain retail customers having financial difficulties may have the terms of their credit card and other loan agreements modified to require only principal payments and, as such, are reported as nonaccrual.  
 For all loan classes, interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are generally recorded as a reduction to a loan s carrying amount while a loan
is on nonaccrual and are recognized as interest income upon payoff of the loan. However, interest income may be recognized for interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible. In certain circumstances,
loans in  

91       

any class may be restored to accrual status, such as when a loan has demonstrated sustained repayment performance or no amounts are past due and prospects for future payment are no longer in
doubt; or when the loan becomes well secured and is in the process of collection. Loans where there has been a partial charge-off may be returned to accrual status if all principal and interest (including amounts previously charged-off) is expected
to be collected and the loan is current.    Covered loans not considered to be purchased impaired are evaluated for delinquency, nonaccrual status and
charge-off consistent with the class of loan they would be included in had the loss share coverage not been in place. Generally, purchased impaired loans are considered accruing loans. However, the timing and amount of future cash flows for some
loans is not reasonably estimable, and those loans are classified as nonaccrual loans with interest income not recognized until the timing and amount of the future cash flows can be reasonably estimated.  
 The Company classifies its loan portfolios using internal credit quality ratings on a quarterly basis. These ratings include: pass, special mention and
classified, and are an important part of the Company s overall credit risk management process and evaluation of the allowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those not classified on the Company s rating scale for
problem credits, as minimal credit risk has been identified. Special mention loans are those that have a potential weakness deserving management s close attention. Classified loans are those where a well-defined weakness has been identified
that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. It is possible that others, given the same information, may reach different reasonable conclusions regarding the credit quality rating classification of specific loans.  
  Troubled Debt Restructurings  In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is
experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. Concessionary modifications are classified as TDRs unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in payments to be received. The Company
recognizes interest on TDRs if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions as agreed upon with the Company and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which
is generally six months or greater. To the extent a previous restructuring was insignificant, the Company considers the cumulative effect of past restructurings related to the receivable when determining whether a current restructuring is a TDR.
Loans classified as TDRs are considered impaired loans for reporting and measurement purposes.

The Company has implemented certain restructuring programs that may result in TDRs. However, many of the
Company s TDRs are also determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes.    For the commercial lending
segment, modifications generally result in the Company working with borrowers on a case-by-case basis. Commercial and commercial real estate modifications generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or
decrease to the interest rate, which may not be deemed a market rate of interest. In addition, the Company may work with the borrower in identifying other changes that mitigate loss to the Company, which may include additional collateral or
guarantees to support the loan. To a lesser extent, the Company may waive contractual principal. The Company classifies all of the above concessions as TDRs to the extent the Company determines that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty.
   Modifications for the consumer lending segment are generally part of programs the Company has initiated. The Company participates in the U.S.
Department of Treasury Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ). HAMP gives qualifying homeowners an opportunity to permanently modify residential mortgage loans and achieve more affordable monthly payments, with the U.S. Department
of Treasury compensating the Company for a portion of the reduction in monthly amounts due from borrowers participating in this program. The Company also modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal Housing Administration, Department of
Veterans Affairs, or its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company provides concessions to qualifying borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The concessions may include adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable
rates to fixed rates, extension of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, participation in
residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement and the loan documents are
not modified until that time. The Company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs and continues to report them as TDRs after the trial period.  
 Credit card and other retail loan TDRs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers experiencing financial difficulty with
modifications whereby balances may be amortized up to 60 months, and generally include waiver of fees and reduced interest rates.

92       

In addition, the Company considers secured loans to consumer borrowers that have debt discharged through
bankruptcy where the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be TDRs.    Modifications to loans in the covered segment are similar in nature to that
described above for non-covered loans, and the evaluation and determination of TDR status is similar, except that acquired loans restructured after acquisition are not considered TDRs for accounting and disclosure purposes if the loans evidenced
credit deterioration as of the acquisition date and are accounted for in pools. Losses associated with the modification on covered loans, including the economic impact of interest rate reductions, are generally eligible for reimbursement under loss
sharing agreements with the FDIC.     Impaired Loans  For all loan classes, a loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current events or information, it is
probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due per the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans include all nonaccrual and TDR loans. For all loan classes, interest income on TDR loans is recognized under the modified
terms and conditions if the borrower has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles. Interest income is generally not recognized on other impaired loans until the loan is paid off.
However, interest income may be recognized for interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible.  
 Factors used by the Company in determining whether all principal and interest payments due on commercial and commercial real estate loans will be
collected and therefore whether those loans are impaired include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of the borrower, collateral and/or guarantees on the loan, and the borrower s estimated future ability to pay based on industry,
geographic location and certain financial ratios. The evaluation of impairment on residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans is primarily driven by delinquency status of individual loans or whether a loan has been modified, and
considers any government guarantee where applicable. Individual covered loans, whose future losses are covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company, are evaluated for impairment
and accounted for in a manner consistent with the class of loan they would have been included in had the loss sharing coverage not been in place.     Leases  The
Company s lease portfolio includes both direct financing and leveraged leases. The net investment in direct

financing leases is the sum of all minimum lease payments and estimated residual values, less unearned income. Unearned income is recorded in interest income over the terms of the leases to
produce a level yield.    The investment in leveraged leases is the sum of all lease payments, less nonrecourse debt payments, plus estimated residual
values, less unearned income. Income from leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the leases based on the unrecovered equity investment.  
 Residual values on leased assets are reviewed regularly for other-than-temporary impairment. Residual valuations for retail automobile leases are based
on independent assessments of expected used car sale prices at the end-of-term. Impairment tests are conducted based on these valuations considering the probability of the lessee returning the asset to the Company, re-marketing efforts, insurance
coverage and ancillary fees and costs. Valuations for commercial leases are based upon external or internal management appraisals. When there is impairment of the Company s interest in the residual value of a leased asset, the carrying value is
reduced to the estimated fair value with the writedown recognized in the current period.     Other Real Estate  OREO is included in other assets, and is property
acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings on defaulted loans. OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs. The fair value of OREO is evaluated regularly and any decreases in value along with holding costs, such as
taxes and insurance, are reported in noninterest expense.     LOANS HELD FOR SALE   
 Loans held for sale ( LHFS ) represent mortgage loans intended to be sold in the secondary market and other loans that management has an active plan to sell.
LHFS are carried at the lower-of-cost-or-fair value as determined on an aggregate basis by type of loan with the exception of loans for which the Company has elected fair value accounting, which are carried at fair value. The credit component of any
writedowns upon the transfer of loans to LHFS is reflected in loan charge-offs.    Where an election is made to carry the LHFS at fair value, any
change in fair value is recognized in noninterest income. Where an election is made to carry LHFS at lower-of-cost-or-fair value, any further decreases are recognized in noninterest income and increases in fair value above the loan cost basis are
not recognized until the loans are sold. Fair value elections are made at the time of origination or purchase based on the Company s fair value election policy. The Company has elected fair value accounting for substantially all its mortgage
loans held for sale ( MLHFS ).  

93       

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to manage various risks and to accommodate the business requirements of its customers.
Derivative instruments are reported in other assets or other liabilities at fair value. Changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.  
 All derivative instruments that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value and classified as either a hedge of the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability ( fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow hedge  or a hedge
of the volatility of an investment in foreign operations driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates ( net investment hedge ). Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a fair value
hedge, and the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, are recorded in earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income
(loss) until cash flows of the hedged item are realized. Any change in fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recorded in noninterest income. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges that are highly effective are
recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company performs an assessment, at inception and, at a minimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine the effectiveness of the derivative in offsetting changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged
item(s).    If a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss in other comprehensive
income (loss) is amortized to earnings over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in other comprehensive
income (loss) is reported in earnings immediately, unless the forecasted transaction is at least reasonably possible of occurring, whereby the amounts remain within other comprehensive income (loss).  
  REVENUE RECOGNITION     The Company recognizes revenue as it is earned based on
contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are provided and collectability is reasonably assured. In certain circumstances, noninterest income is reported net of associated expenses that are directly related to variable volume-based
sales or revenue sharing arrangements or

when the Company acts on an agency basis for others. Certain specific policies include the following:     Credit
and Debit Card Revenue  Credit and debit card revenue includes interchange from consumer credit and debit cards processed through card association networks, annual fees, and other transaction and account management fees. Interchange rates are
generally set by the credit card associations and based on purchase volumes and other factors. The Company records interchange as transactions occur. Transaction and account management fees are recognized as transactions occur or services are
provided, except for annual fees which are recognized over the applicable period. Volume-related payments to partners and credit card associations and costs for rewards programs are also recorded within credit and debit card revenue when earned by
the partner or customer.     Corporate Payment Products Revenue  Corporate payment products revenue primarily includes interchange from corporate and purchasing
cards processed through card association networks and revenue from proprietary network transactions. The Company records corporate payment products revenue as transactions occur. Volume-related payments to customers and credit card associations are
also recorded within corporate payment products revenue when earned by the customer or card association.     Merchant Processing Services  Merchant processing
services revenue consists principally of merchant discount and other transaction and account management fees charged to merchants for the electronic processing of card association network transactions, net of interchange paid to the card-issuing
bank, card association assessments, and revenue sharing amounts. All of these are recognized at the time the merchant s transactions are processed or other services are performed. The Company may enter into revenue sharing agreements with
referral partners or in connection with purchases of merchant contracts from sellers. The revenue sharing amounts are determined primarily on sales volume processed or revenue generated for a particular group of merchants. Merchant processing
revenue also includes revenues related to point-of-sale equipment recorded as sales when the equipment is shipped or as earned for equipment rentals.     Trust and
Investment Management Fees  Trust and investment management fees are recognized over the period in which services are performed and are based on a percentage of the fair value of the assets under management or administration, fixed based on
account type, or transaction-based fees.  

94       

Deposit Service Charges  Service charges on deposit accounts are primarily monthly fees based on minimum balances or
transaction-based fees. These fees are recognized as earned or as transactions occur and services are provided.     Commercial Products Revenue  Commercial
products revenue primarily includes revenue related to ancillary services provided to Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate customers including standby letter of credit fees, non-yield related loan fees, capital markets related revenue and
non-yield related leasing revenue. These fees are recognized as earned or as transactions occur and services are provided.     Mortgage Banking Revenue  Mortgage
banking revenue includes revenue derived from mortgages originated and subsequently sold, generally with servicing retained. The primary components include: gains and losses on mortgage sales; servicing revenue; changes in fair value for mortgage
loans originated with the intent to sell and measured at fair value under the fair value option; changes in fair value for derivative commitments to purchase and originate mortgage loans; changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights
( MSRs  and the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage origination pipeline, funded loans and MSRs. Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income. Refer to Other Significant Policies in
Note 1, as well as Note 10 and Note 22 for a further discussion of MSRs.     OTHER SIGNIFICANT POLICIES   
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Goodwill is recorded on acquired businesses if the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other
intangible assets are recorded at their fair value upon completion of a business acquisition or certain other transactions, and generally represent the value of customer contracts or relationships. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject, at a
minimum, to annual tests for impairment at a reporting unit level. In certain situations, an interim impairment test may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying amount. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, using straight-line and accelerated methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the
carrying amount. Determining the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, includes assessing the current implied fair value of the reporting unit as if it were being acquired in a business combination and comparing it to the carrying amount of the
reporting unit s goodwill. Determining the amount of other intangible asset impairment, if any, includes assessing the present value of the estimated

future cash flows associated with the intangible asset and comparing it to the carrying amount of the asset.  
  Income Taxes  Deferred taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their
financial reporting carrying amounts. The Company uses the deferral method of accounting on investments that generate investment tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to the related asset. Beginning
January 1, 2014, the Company presents the expense on certain qualified affordable housing investments in tax expense rather than noninterest expense.  
  Mortgage Servicing Rights  MSRs are capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained or if they are purchased from others. MSRs are
recorded at fair value. The Company determines the fair value by estimating the present value of the asset s future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates, and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade
information, industry surveys and independent third party valuations. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recorded in earnings as mortgage banking revenue during the period in which they occur.  
  Pensions  For purposes of its pension plans, the Company utilizes its fiscal year-end as the measurement date. At the measurement date, plan assets are determined
based on fair value, generally representing observable market prices or the net asset value provided by the plans  administrator. The actuarial cost method used to compute the pension liabilities and related expense is the projected unit credit
method. The projected benefit obligation is principally determined based on the present value of projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate. The discount rate utilized is based on the investment yield of high quality corporate bonds
available in the marketplace with maturities equal to projected cash flows of future benefit payments as of the measurement date. Periodic pension expense (or income) includes service costs, interest costs based on the assumed discount rate, the
expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially derived market-related value and amortization of actuarial gains and losses. Pension accounting reflects the long-term nature of benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets,
and can have the effect of reducing earnings volatility related to short-term changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized gains and losses which are
deferred and amortized over the future service periods of active employees. The market-related value utilized to determine the expected return on plan assets is based on fair value adjusted for the difference between

95       

expected returns and actual performance of plan assets. The unrealized difference between actual experience and expected returns is included in expense over a period of approximately twelve
years. The overfunded or underfunded status of the plans is recorded as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in that status recognized through other comprehensive income (loss).  
  Premises and Equipment  Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated primarily on a straight-line basis over the
estimated life of the assets. Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for newly constructed buildings and from 3 to 20 years for furniture and equipment.  
 Capitalized leases, less accumulated amortization, are included in premises and equipment. Capitalized lease obligations are included in long-term debt.
Capitalized leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and the amortization is included in depreciation expense.     Stock-Based
Compensation  The Company grants stock-based awards, including restricted stock, restricted stock units and options to purchase common stock of the Company. Stock option grants are for a fixed number of shares to employees and directors with an
exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants are awarded at no cost to the recipient. Stock-based compensation for awards is recognized in the Company s results of
operations on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company immediately recognizes compensation cost of awards to employees that meet retirement status, despite their continued active employment. The amortization of stock-based
compensation reflects estimated forfeitures adjusted for actual forfeiture experience. As compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of
restrictions. At the time stock-based awards are exercised, cancelled, expire, or restrictions are released, the Company may be required to recognize an adjustment to tax expense, depending on the market price of the Company s common stock at
that time.     Per Share Calculations  Earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income applicable to U.S. Bancorp common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting income and outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities.

NOTE 2    ACCOUNTING CHANGES  
      
   Revenue Recognition  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued accounting guidance, originally effective
for the Company on January 1, 2017, related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance by one year, resulting in it becoming effective for the Company on
January 1, 2018.    This guidance amends certain currently existing revenue recognition accounting guidance and allows for either retrospective
application to all periods presented or a modified retrospective approach where the guidance would only be applied to existing contracts in effect at the adoption date and new contracts going forward. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of this guidance under the modified retrospective approach and expects the adoption will not be material to its financial statements.     Consolidation  In
February 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance, effective for the Company on January 1, 2016, related to the analysis required by organizations to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. The Company expects the
adoption of this guidance will not be material to its financial statements.      

NOTE 3    BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  
      
  In June 2014, the Company acquired the Chicago-area branch banking operations of the Charter One Bank franchise ( Charter One ) owned by RBS
Citizens Financial Group. The acquisition included Charter One s retail branch network, small business operations and select middle market relationships. The Company acquired approximately $969 million of loans and $4.8 billion of deposits
with this transaction.      

NOTE 4    RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS  
      
  Banking regulators require bank subsidiaries to maintain minimum average reserve balances, either in the form of cash or reserve balances held with
central banks or other financial institutions. The amount of required reserve balances were approximately $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and primarily represent those required to be held at the
Federal Reserve Bank. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company held $3.3 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, of balances at the Federal Reserve Bank and other financial institutions to meet these requirements. These balances are included
in cash and due from banks on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 5     INVESTMENT SECURITIES  
      
  The amortized cost, other-than-temporary impairment recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), gross unrealized holding gains and losses, and fair
value of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investment securities at December 31 were as follows:      

(a)  
  Held-to-maturity investment securities are carried at historical cost or at fair value at the time of transfer from the available-for-sale to held-to-maturity category, adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts and credit-related other-than-temporary impairment.     

(b)  
  Available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair value with unrealized net gains or losses reported within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders  equity.

(c)  
  Prime securities are those designated as such by the issuer at origination. When an issuer designation is unavailable, the Company determines at acquisition date the categorization based on asset pool characteristics
(such as weighted-average credit score, loan-to-value, loan type, prevalence of low documentation loans) and deal performance (such as pool delinquencies and security market spreads). When the Company determines the designation, prime securities
typically have a weighted average credit score of 725 or higher and a loan-to-value of 80 percent or lower; however, other pool characteristics may result in designations that deviate from these credit score and loan-to-value thresholds.

(d)  
  Includes all securities not meeting the conditions to be designated as prime.     

(e)  
  Represents impairment not related to credit for those investment securities that have been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.     

(f)  
  Represents unrealized losses on investment securities that have not been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.     
    
  The weighted-average maturity of the available-for-sale investment securities was 4.7 years at
December 31, 2015, compared with 4.3 years at December 31, 2014. The corresponding weighted-average yields were 2.21 percent and 2.32 percent, respectively. The weighted-average maturity of the held-to-maturity investment securities was
4.2

years at December 31, 2015, and 4.0 years at December 31, 2014. The corresponding weighted-average yields were both 1.92 percent, respectively.  
 For amortized cost, fair value and yield by maturity date of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investment securities outstanding at
December 31, 2015, refer to Table 13 included  

97       

in Management s Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 Investment securities with a fair value of $13.1 billion at December 31, 2015, and $12.6 billion at December 31, 2014, were pledged to secure
public, private and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes required by

contractual obligation or law. Included in these amounts were securities where the Company and certain counterparties have agreements granting the counterparties the right to sell or pledge the
securities. Investment securities securing these types of arrangements had a fair value of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2015, and $856 million at December 31, 2014.

The following table provides information about the
amount of interest income from taxable and non-taxable investment securities:      
   The following table provides information about the amount of gross gains and losses realized through the sales of available-for-sale
investment securities:      

The Company conducts a regular assessment of its investment securities with unrealized losses to
determine whether investment securities are other-than-temporarily impaired considering, among other factors, the nature of the investment securities, credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent and duration of the unrealized
loss, expected cash flows of underlying collateral, the existence of any government or agency guarantees, market conditions and whether the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the investment
securities. The Company determines other-than-temporary

impairment recorded in earnings for debt securities not intended to be sold by estimating the future cash flows of each individual investment security, using market information where available,
and discounting the cash flows at the original effective rate of the investment security. Other-than-temporary impairment recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) is measured as the difference between that discounted amount and the fair value
of each investment security. The total amount of other-than-temporary impairment recorded was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Changes in the credit losses on debt securities are
summarized as follows:      

(a)  
  Primarily represents principal losses allocated to mortgage and asset-backed securities in the Company s portfolio under the terms of the securitization transaction documents.     
    
      98       

At December 31, 2015, certain investment securities had a fair value below amortized cost. The following table shows
the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company s investment securities with unrealized losses, aggregated by investment category and length of time the individual investment securities have been in continuous unrealized loss
positions, at December 31, 2015:      

(a)  
  The Company had $5 million of unrealized losses on residential non-agency mortgage-backed securities. Credit-related other-than-temporary impairment on these securities may occur if there is further deterioration in
the underlying collateral pool performance. Borrower defaults may increase if economic conditions worsen. Additionally, deterioration in home prices may increase the severity of projected losses.     

(b)  
  Prime securities are those designated as such by the issuer at origination. When an issuer designation is unavailable, the Company determines at acquisition date the categorization based on asset pool characteristics
(such as weighted-average credit score, loan-to-value, loan type, prevalence of low documentation loans) and deal performance (such as pool delinquencies and security market spreads).     

(c)  
  Includes all securities not meeting the conditions to be designated as prime.     
    
  The Company does not consider these unrealized losses to be credit-related. These unrealized losses
primarily relate to changes in interest rates and market spreads subsequent to purchase. A substantial portion of investment securities that have unrealized losses are either corporate debt issued with high investment grade credit ratings or agency
mortgage-backed securities. In general, the issuers of the investment

securities are contractually prohibited from prepayment at less than par, and the Company did not pay significant purchase premiums for these investment securities. At December 31, 2015, the
Company had no plans to sell investment securities with unrealized losses, and believes it is more likely than not it would not be required to sell such investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost.

99       

NOTE 6    LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
      
  The composition of the loan portfolio at December 31, disaggregated by class and underlying specific portfolio type, was as follows:  

The Company had loans of $78.1 billion at December 31, 2015, and $79.8 billion at December 31,
2014, pledged at the Federal Home Loan Bank, and loans of $63.4 billion at December 31, 2015, and $61.8 billion at December 31, 2014, pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank.  
 The majority of the Company s loans are to borrowers in the states in which it has Consumer and Small Business Banking offices. Collateral for
commercial loans may include marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. For details of the Company s commercial portfolio by industry group and geography as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, see Table 7 included in
Management s Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    For detail of
the Company s commercial real estate portfolio by property type and geography as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, see Table 8 included in Management s

Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Such loans are collateralized by the related property.  
 Originated loans are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned interest and deferred fees and costs. Net unearned interest and
deferred fees and costs amounted to $550 million at December 31, 2015, and $574 million at December 31, 2014. All purchased loans and related indemnification assets are recorded at fair value at the date of purchase. The Company
evaluates purchased loans for impairment at the date of purchase in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance. Purchased loans with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually
required payments will not be collected are considered  purchased impaired loans.  All other purchased loans are considered  purchased nonimpaired loans. 

100       

Changes in the accretable balance for purchased impaired loans for the years ended December 31, were as follows:  

(a)  
  Primarily relates to changes in expected credit performance.     

(b)  
  The amount for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily represents the reclassification of unamortized decreases in the FDIC asset, partially offset by the impact of changes in expectations about retaining
covered single-family loans beyond the term of the indemnification agreements.     
    
   Allowance for Credit Losses  The allowance for credit losses reserves for probable and estimable losses incurred in
the Company s loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, and includes certain amounts that do

not represent loss exposure to the Company because those losses are recoverable under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC.

Activity in the allowance for credit losses by
portfolio class was as follows:      

(a)  
  Includes net changes in credit losses to be reimbursed by the FDIC and reductions in the allowance for covered loans where the reversal of a previously recorded allowance was offset by an associated decrease in the
indemnification asset, and the impact of any loan sales.     
    
      101       

Additional detail of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio class was as follows:  

(a)  
  Represents the allowance for credit losses related to loans greater than $5 million classified as nonperforming or TDRs.     
 Additional detail of loan balances by portfolio class was as follows:      

(a)  
  Represents loans greater than $5 million classified as nonperforming or TDRs.     

(b)  
  Includes expected reimbursements from the FDIC under loss sharing agreements.     
    
   Credit Quality  The quality of the Company s loan portfolios is assessed as a function of net credit losses,
levels of nonperforming assets and delinquencies, and credit quality ratings as defined by the Company. These credit quality

ratings are an important part of the Company s overall credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses.

102       

The following table provides a summary of loans by portfolio class, including the delinquency status of those that continue
to accrue interest, and those that are nonperforming:      

(a)  
  At December 31, 2015, $320 million of loans 30 89 days past due and $2.9 billion of loans 90 days or more past due purchased from Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ) mortgage pools
whose repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, were classified as current, compared with $431 million and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2014, respectively.

Total nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, restructured loans not performing in accordance with
modified terms, other real estate and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company. For details of the Company s nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, see Table 16 included in Management s Discussion and Analysis
which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    At December 31, 2015, the amount of foreclosed
residential real estate held by the Company, and included in OREO, was $282 million ($250 million excluding covered assets), compared with $270 million ($233 million excluding covered assets) at December 31, 2014. This excludes $535

million and $641 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of foreclosed residential real estate related to mortgage loans whose payments are primarily insured by the Federal
Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. In addition, the amount of residential mortgage loans secured by residential real estate in the process of foreclosure at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $2.6 billion
and $2.9 billion, respectively, of which $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, related to loans purchased from Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ) mortgage pools whose repayments are insured by the Federal Housing
Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  

103       

The following table provides a summary of loans by portfolio class and the Company s internal credit quality rating:

(a)  
  Classified rating on consumer loans primarily based on delinquency status.     

(c)  
  At December 31, 2015, $2.9 billion of GNMA loans 90 days or more past due and $1.9 billion of restructured GNMA loans whose repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the
Department of Veterans Affairs were classified with a pass rating, compared with $3.1 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2014, respectively.     
 For all loan classes, a loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current events or information, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts
due per the contractual terms of the loan agreement. A summary of impaired loans, which include all nonaccrual and TDR loans, by portfolio class was as follows:      

(a)  
  Substantially all loans classified as impaired at December 31, 2015 and 2014, had an associated allowance for credit losses. The total amount of interest income recognized during 2015 on loans classified as impaired
at December 31, 2015, excluding those acquired with deteriorated credit quality, was $274 million, compared to what would have been recognized at the original contractual terms of the loans of $370 million.     
    
      104       

Additional information on impaired loans for the years ended December 31 follows:  

105       

Troubled Debt Restructurings  In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the
collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. The following table provides a summary of loans modified as TDRs for the years ended December 31, by
portfolio class:      

Residential mortgages, home equity and second mortgages, and loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools in
the table above include trial period arrangements offered to customers during the periods presented. The post-modification balances for these loans reflect the current outstanding balance until a permanent modification is made. In addition, the
post-modification balances typically include capitalization of unpaid accrued interest and/or fees under the various modification programs. For those loans modified as

TDRs during the fourth quarter of 2015, at December 31, 2015, 151 residential mortgages, 66 home equity and second mortgage loans and 1,954 loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools with
outstanding balances of $18 million, $5 million and $257 million, respectively, were in a trial period and have estimated post-modification balances of $24 million, $5 million and $259 million, respectively, assuming permanent modification
occurs at the end of the trial period.  

106       

The following table provides a summary of TDR loans that defaulted (fully or partially charged-off or became 90 days or
more past due) for the years ended December 31, that were modified as TDRs within 12 months previous to default:      

In addition to the defaults in the table above, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company
had a total of 1,885 residential mortgage loans, home equity and second mortgage loans and loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools with aggregate outstanding balances of $252 million

where borrowers did not successfully complete the trial period arrangement and therefore are no longer eligible for a permanent modification under the applicable modification program.

Covered Assets  Covered assets represent loans
and other assets acquired from the FDIC, subject to loss sharing agreements, and include expected reimbursements from the FDIC. The carrying amount of the covered assets at December 31, consisted of purchased impaired loans, purchased
nonimpaired loans and other assets as shown in the following table:      

(a)  
  Relates to loss sharing agreements with remaining terms up to four years.     

(b)  
  Represents decreases in expected reimbursements by the FDIC as a result of decreases in expected losses on the covered loans. These amounts are amortized as a reduction in interest income on covered loans over the
shorter of the expected life of the respective covered loans or the remaining contractual term of the indemnification agreements.     
    
      107       

Interest income is recognized on purchased impaired loans through accretion of the difference between the
carrying amount of those loans and their expected cash flows. The initial determination of the fair value of the purchased loans includes

the impact of expected credit losses and, therefore, no allowance for credit losses is recorded at the purchase date. To the extent credit deterioration occurs after the date of acquisition, the
Company records an allowance for credit losses.  

NOTE 7    LEASES  
      
  The components of the net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases at December 31 were as follows:  

The minimum future lease payments to be received from sales-type and direct financing leases were as follows at December 31, 2015:  

NOTE 8    ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND VARIABLE 
INTEREST ENTITIES  

The Company transfers financial assets in the normal course of business. The majority of the Company s financial asset
transfers are residential mortgage loan sales primarily to government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ), transfers of tax-advantaged investments, commercial loan sales through participation agreements, and other individual or portfolio loan
and securities sales. In accordance with the accounting guidance for asset transfers, the Company considers any ongoing involvement with transferred assets in determining whether the assets can be derecognized from the balance sheet. Guarantees
provided to certain third parties in connection with the transfer of assets are further discussed in Note 23.    For loans sold under participation
agreements, the Company also considers whether the terms of the loan participation agreement meet the accounting definition of a participating interest. With the exception of servicing and certain performance-based guarantees, the Company s
continuing involvement with financial assets sold is minimal and generally limited to market customary representation and warranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale depends on the previous carrying amount of the transferred financial assets, the
consideration received, and any liabilities incurred in exchange for the transferred assets. Upon transfer, any servicing assets and other interests that continue to be held by the Company are initially recognized at fair value. For further
information on MSRs, refer to Note 10. On a limited basis, the Company may acquire and package high-grade corporate bonds for select corporate

customers, in which the Company generally has no continuing involvement with these transactions. Additionally, the Company is an authorized GNMA issuer and issues GNMA securities on a regular
basis. The Company has no other asset securitizations or similar asset-backed financing arrangements that are off-balance sheet.    The Company is
involved in various entities that are considered to be VIEs. The Company s investments in VIEs are primarily related to investments promoting affordable housing, community development and renewable energy sources. Some of these tax-advantaged
investments support the Company s regulatory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. The Company s investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other
tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified time periods. These tax credits are recognized as a reduction of tax expense or, for investments qualifying as investment tax credits, as a reduction to
the related investment asset. The Company recognized federal and state income tax credits related to its affordable housing and other tax-advantaged investments in tax expense of $733 million, $773 million and $758 million for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company also recognized $1.2 billion, $937 million and $780 million of investment tax credits for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

108       

The Company recognized $698 million, $771 million and $934 million of expenses related to all of these investments for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of
which $261 million, $258 million and $297 million, respectively, was included in tax expense and the remainder was included in noninterest expense.  
 The Company is not required to consolidate VIEs in which it has concluded it does not have a controlling financial interest, and thus is not the primary
beneficiary. In such cases, the Company does not have both the power to direct the entities  most significant activities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs.
   The Company s investments in these unconsolidated VIEs are carried in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company s
unfunded capital and other commitments related to these unconsolidated VIEs are generally carried in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company s maximum exposure to loss from these unconsolidated VIEs include the
investment recorded on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of unfunded capital commitments, and previously recorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at
the project level. While the Company believes potential losses from these investments are remote, the maximum exposure was determined by assuming a scenario where the community-based business and housing projects completely fail and do not meet
certain government compliance requirements resulting in recapture of the related tax credits.    The following table provides a summary of investments in community
development and tax-advantaged VIEs that the Company has not consolidated:      
   The Company also has noncontrolling financial investments in private investment funds and partnerships considered to be
VIEs, which are not consolidated. The Company s recorded investment in these entities, carried in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was approximately $32 million at December 31, 2015, compared with $94 million at
December 31, 2014. The maximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs was $47 million at December 31, 2015 and $105 million at December 31, 2014,

representing the Company s investment balance and its unfunded commitments to invest additional amounts.  
 The Company s individual net investments in unconsolidated VIEs, which exclude any unfunded capital commitments, ranged from less than $1 million
to $46 million at December 31, 2015, compared with less than $1 million to $53 million at December 31, 2014.    The Company is required to
consolidate VIEs in which it has concluded it has a controlling financial interest. The Company sponsors entities to which it transfers its interests in tax-advantaged investments to third parties. At December 31, 2015, approximately $3.0
billion of the Company s assets and $2.2 billion of its liabilities included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were related to community development and tax-advantaged investment VIEs which the Company has consolidated, primarily related to
these transfers. These amounts compared to $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2014. The majority of the assets of these consolidated VIEs are reported in other assets, and the liabilities are reported in long-term debt
and other liabilities. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. The creditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The Company s exposure to the consolidated
VIEs is generally limited to the carrying value of its variable interests plus any related tax credits previously recognized or transferred to others with a guarantee.  
 The Company also sponsors a conduit to which it previously transferred high-grade investment securities. The Company consolidates the conduit because of
its ability to manage the activities of the conduit. At December 31, 2015, $28 million of the held- to-maturity investment securities on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet were related to the conduit, compared with $35 million at
December 31, 2014.    In addition, the Company sponsors a municipal bond securities tender option bond program. The Company controls the
activities of the program s entities, is entitled to the residual returns and provides credit, liquidity and remarketing arrangements to the program. As a result, the Company has consolidated the program s entities. At December 31,
2015, $2.3 billion of available-for-sale investment securities and $2.2 billion of short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were related to the tender option bond program, compared with $2.9 billion of available-for-sale investment
securities and $2.7 billion of short-term borrowings at December 31, 2014.  

109       

NOTE 9    PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT  
      
  Premises and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following:      

NOTE 10    MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS  

The Company serviced $231.8 billion of residential mortgage loans for others at December 31, 2015, and $225.0 billion
at December 31, 2014, which include subserviced mortgages with no corresponding MSRs asset. The net impact included in mortgage banking revenue of fair value changes of MSRs due to changes in valuation assumptions and derivatives used to
economically hedge MSRs were net gains of $23 million,

$241 million (of which $44 million related to excess servicing rights sold during 2014) and $192 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Loan
servicing fees, not including valuation changes, included in mortgage banking revenue, were $728 million, $732 million and $754 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Changes in fair value of capitalized MSRs for the
years ended December 31, are summarized as follows:      

(a)  
  Includes changes in MSR value associated with changes in market interest rates, including estimated prepayment rates and anticipated earnings on escrow deposits.     

(b)  
  Includes changes in MSR value not caused by changes in market interest rates, such as changes in cost to service, ancillary income, and discount rate, as well as the impact of any model changes. 2014 includes a $44
million revaluation gain related to excess servicing rights sold.     

(c)  
  Primarily represents changes due to realization of expected cash flows over time (decay).       The estimated
sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the MSRs portfolio and the related derivative instruments as of December 31 follows:      

The fair value of MSRs and their sensitivity to changes in interest rates is influenced by the mix of the
servicing portfolio and characteristics of each segment of the portfolio. The Company s servicing portfolio consists of the distinct portfolios of government-insured mortgages, conventional mortgages and Housing Finance Agency ( HFA )
mortgages. The servicing portfolios are predominantly comprised of
fixed- 

rate agency loans with limited adjustable-rate or jumbo mortgage loans. The HFA division specializes in servicing loans made under state and local housing authority programs. These programs
provide mortgages to low-income and moderate-income borrowers and are generally government-insured programs with a favorable rate subsidy, down payment and/or closing cost assistance.

110       

A summary of the Company s MSRs and related characteristics by portfolio as of December 31 follows:  

(a)  
  Represents principal balance of mortgages having corresponding MSR asset.     

(b)  
  Value is calculated as fair value divided by the servicing portfolio.     

(c)  
  Represents loans sold primarily to GSEs.         

NOTE 11    INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
      
  Intangible assets consisted of the following:      

(a)  
  Estimated life represents the amortization period for assets subject to the straight line method and the weighted average or life of the underlying cash flows amortization period for intangibles subject to
accelerated methods. If more than one amortization method is used for a category, the estimated life for each method is calculated and reported separately.     

(b) Amortization methods:   
    
    SL = straight line method    

AC = accelerated methods generally based on cash flows    

(c)

long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2015, were:      

NOTE 14    JUNIOR  
  SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES     
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company sponsored, and wholly owned 100 percent of the common equity of, USB Capital IX, a wholly-owned
unconsolidated trust, formed for the purpose of issuing redeemable Income Trust Securities ( ITS ) to third party investors, originally investing the proceeds

in junior subordinated debt securities ( Debentures ) issued by the Company and entering into stock purchase contracts to purchase preferred stock in the future. During 2010, the
Company exchanged depositary shares representing an ownership interest in its Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock ( Series A Preferred Stock ) to acquire a portion of the ITS issued by USB Capital IX and retire a portion of
the Debentures and cancel a pro-rata portion of stock purchase contracts. During 2011, USB Capital IX sold the remaining Debentures, originally issued by the Company to the trust, to investors to generate cash proceeds to purchase the Company s
Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the stock purchase contracts. As part of this sale, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company purchased $176 million of the Debentures, which effectively retired the debt. The Company classifies the remaining $500
million of Debentures at December 31, 2015 and 2014, as long-term debt. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, $676 million of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock was the sole asset of USB Capital IX. The Company s obligations
under the transaction documents, taken together, have the effect of providing a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company, on a junior subordinated basis, of the payment obligations of the trust.

NOTE 15    SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY  

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had authority to issue 4 billion shares of common stock and 50 million
shares of preferred stock. The Company had 1.7 billion and 1.8 billion shares of common stock outstanding at

December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company had 80 million shares reserved for future issuances, primarily under its stock incentive plans at December 31, 2015.

The number of shares issued and outstanding and the
carrying amount of each outstanding series of the Company s preferred stock was as follows:      

During 2015, the Company issued depositary shares representing an ownership interest in
30,000 shares of Series I Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (the  Series I Preferred Stock ). The Series I Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and will not be

2021, and thereafter will accrue and be payable quarterly at a floating rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR plus 3.486 percent. The Series I Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company s option, in whole or in part, on or after
January 15, 2021. The Series I Preferred stock is redeemable at the Company s option, in whole, but not in part, prior to January 15, 2021 within 90 days following an official administrative or judicial decision, amendment to, or
change in the laws or regulations that would not allow the Company to treat the full liquidation value of the Series I Preferred Stock as Tier 1 capital for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve.  
 During 2013, the Company issued depositary shares representing an ownership interest in 20,000 shares of Series H Non-Cumulative Perpetual
Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (the  Series H Preferred Stock ). The Series H Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the

or after July 15, 2018. The Series H Preferred stock is redeemable at the Company s option, in whole, but not in part, prior to July 15, 2018 within 90 days following an official
administrative or judicial decision, amendment to, or change in the laws or regulations that would not allow the Company to treat the full liquidation value of the Series H Preferred Stock as Tier 1 capital for purposes of the capital adequacy
guidelines of the Federal Reserve.    During 2012, the Company issued depositary shares representing an ownership interest in 44,000 shares of
Series F Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (the  Series F Preferred Stock ), and depositary shares representing an ownership interest in 43,400 shares of

the Company s option, in whole, but not in part, prior to January 15, 2022, for the Series F Preferred Stock and prior to April 15, 2017, for the Series G Preferred Stock, within
90 days following an official administrative or judicial decision, amendment to, or change in the laws or regulations that would not allow the Company to treat the full liquidation value of the Series F Preferred Stock or Series G Preferred Stock,
respectively, as Tier 1 capital for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board.    During 2010, the Company issued
depositary shares representing an ownership interest in 5,746 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to investors, in exchange for their portion of USB Capital IX Income Trust Securities. During 2011, the Company issued depositary shares
representing an ownership interest in 6,764 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to USB Capital IX, thereby settling the stock purchase contract established between the Company and USB Capital IX as part of the 2006 issuance of USB Capital IX Income
Trust Securities. The preferred shares were issued to USB Capital IX for the purchase price specified in the stock forward purchase contract. The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share, no stated maturity and
will not be subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company. Dividends, if declared, will accrue and be payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of three-month LIBOR plus 1.02 percent or
3.50 percent. The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company s option, subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board.

During 2006, the Company issued depositary shares representing an ownership interest in
40,000 shares of Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (the  Series B Preferred Stock ). The Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and will not be
subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company. Dividends, if declared, will accrue and be payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of three-month LIBOR plus .60 percent, or 3.50 percent. The
Series B Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company s option, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.    During 2015, 2014
and 2013, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock under various authorizations approved by its Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2015, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased by the Company under the
current Board of Directors approved authorization was $1.3 billion.    The following table summarizes the Company s common stock repurchased in each of the last
three years:

and into earnings for the years ended December 31, is as follows:      

Regulatory Capital  The Company uses certain measures defined by bank regulatory agencies to access its capital.
Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the following four years to full implementation by January 1, 2018. Basel
III includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets: a general standardized approach and more risk-sensitive advanced approaches, with the Company s capital adequacy being evaluated against the methodology that is
most restrictive.    Tier 1 capital is considered core capital and includes common shareholders  equity adjusted for the aggregate impact of
certain items included in other comprehensive income (loss) ( common equity tier 1 capital ), plus qualifying preferred stock, trust preferred securities and noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries subject to certain
limitations. Total risk-based capital includes Tier 1 capital and

other items such as subordinated debt and the allowance for credit losses. Capital measures are stated as a percentage of risk-adjusted assets, which are measured based on their perceived credit
risk and include certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit, and derivative contracts. Under the standardized approach, the Company is also subject to a leverage ratio requirement, a non risk-based
asset ratio, which is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average assets adjusted for goodwill and other non-qualifying intangibles and other assets.  
 For a summary of the regulatory capital requirements and the actual ratios as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, for the Company and its bank
subsidiary, see Table 23 included in Management s Discussion and Analysis, which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

117       

The following table provides the components of the Company s regulatory capital at December 31:  

(a)  
  Includes the impact of items included in other comprehensive income (loss), such as unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, accumulated net gains on cash flow hedges, pension liability
adjustments, etc.     
    
  Noncontrolling interests principally represent third party investors  interests in consolidated
entities, including preferred stock of consolidated subsidiaries. During 2006, the Company s banking subsidiary formed USB Realty Corp., a real estate investment trust, for the purpose of issuing 5,000 shares of Fixed-to-Floating Rate
Exchangeable Non-cumulative Perpetual Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share ( Series A Preferred Securities ) to third party investors. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Securities, if declared,
will accrue and be payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR plus 1.147 percent. If USB Realty Corp.

has not declared a dividend on the Series A Preferred Securities before the dividend payment date for any dividend period, such dividend shall not be cumulative and shall cease to accrue and be
payable, and USB Realty Corp. will have no obligation to pay dividends accrued for such dividend period, whether or not dividends on the Series A Preferred Securities are declared for any future dividend period.  
 The Series A Preferred Securities will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of USB Realty Corp. on each fifth anniversary after the
dividend payment date occurring in January 2012. Any redemption will be subject to the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

118       

NOTE 16    EARNINGS PER SHARE  
      
  The components of earnings per share were:      

(a)  
  Represents stock issuance costs originally recorded in capital surplus upon the issuance of the Company s Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock that were reclassified to retained earnings on the
redemption date.     
    
  Options outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2013 to purchase 1 million and 5 million
common shares, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per

share for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013, respectively, because they were antidilutive.

NOTE 17    EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  

Employee Retirement Savings Plan  The Company has a defined contribution retirement savings plan that covers
substantially all its employees. Qualified employees are allowed to contribute up to 75 percent of their annual compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limits, through salary deductions under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Employee contributions are invested at their direction among a variety of investment alternatives. Employee contributions are 100 percent matched by the Company, up to four percent of each employee s eligible annual compensation. The
Company s matching contribution vests immediately and is invested in the same manner as each employee s future contribution elections. Total expense for the Company s matching contributions was $131 million, $122 million and $118
million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.     Pension Plans  The Company has a tax qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that provides
benefits to substantially all its employees. Participants receive annual cash balance pay credits based on eligible pay multiplied by a percentage determined by their age and years of service. Participants also receive an annual interest credit.
Employees become vested upon completing three years of vesting service. For participants in the plan before 2010 that elected to stay under their existing formula, pension benefits are provided to eligible employees based on years of service,
multiplied by a percentage of their final average pay. Additionally, as a result of plan mergers, a portion of pension benefits may also be provided using a cash balance benefit formula where only interest credits continue to be credited to
participants  accounts.  
 
  In general, the Company s qualified pension plan s funding objectives include maintaining a
funded status sufficient to meet participant benefit obligations over time while reducing long-term funding requirements and pension costs. The Company has an established process for evaluating the plan, its performance and significant plan
assumptions, including the assumed discount rate and the long-term rate of return ( LTROR ). Annually, the Company s Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the  Committee ), assisted by outside consultants, evaluates
plan objectives, funding policies and plan investment policies considering its long-term investment time horizon and asset allocation strategies. The process also evaluates significant plan assumptions. Although plan assumptions are established
annually, the Company may update its analysis on an interim basis in order to be responsive to significant events that occur during the year, such as plan mergers and amendments.  
 The Company s funding policy is to contribute amounts to its plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Pension Protection Act, plus such additional amounts as the Company determines to be appropriate. The Company made contributions of $414 million and $475 million to its pension plan in 2015 and 2014,
respectively, and expects to contribute $348 million to its pension plan in 2016. Any contributions made to the qualified plan are invested in accordance with established investment policies and asset allocation strategies.

119       

In addition to the funded qualified pension plan, the Company maintains a non-qualified plan that is
unfunded and provides benefits to certain employees. The assumptions used in computing the accumulated benefit obligation, the projected benefit obligation and net pension expense are substantially consistent with those assumptions used for the
funded qualified plan. In 2016, the Company expects to contribute $22 million to its non-qualified pension plan which equals the 2016 expected benefit payments.

Postretirement Welfare Plan  In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides health care and death
benefits to certain former employees who retired prior to January 1, 2014. Employees retiring after December 31, 2013, are not eligible for retiree health care benefits. The Company expects to contribute $7 million to its postretirement
welfare plan in 2016.  

The following table summarizes the changes in benefit
obligations and plan assets for the years ended December 31, and the funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31 for the retirement plans:  

(a)  
  2014 includes $242 million of payments as a result of a bulk lump sum offering to certain deferred vested participants.     
 
 The following table provides information for pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31:  

120       

The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31 for the retirement plans:      

(a)  
  The pretax estimated actuarial loss (gain) and prior service cost (credit) for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in 2016 are
$175 million and $(5) million, respectively.     

(b)  
  The pretax estimated actuarial loss (gain) and prior service cost (credit) for the postretirement welfare plan that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost
in 2016 are $(4) million and $(3) million, respectively.       The following table sets forth weighted average assumptions used to determine the
projected benefit obligations at December 31:      

(b)  
  Determined on an active liability-weighted basis.

The following table sets forth weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended
December 31:      

(b)  
  With the help of an independent pension consultant, the Company considers several sources when developing its expected long-term rates of return on plan assets assumptions, including, but not limited to, past returns
and estimates of future returns given the plans  asset allocation, economic conditions, and peer group LTROR information. The Company determines its expected long-term rates of return reflecting current economic conditions and plan assets.

(c)  
  Determined on an active liability weighted basis.

  Not applicable     
    
   Investment Policies and Asset Allocation  In establishing its investment policies and asset allocation strategies,
the Company considers expected returns and the volatility associated with different strategies. An independent consultant performs modeling that projects numerous outcomes using a broad range of possible scenarios, including a mix of possible rates
of inflation and economic growth. Starting with current economic information, the model bases its projections on past relationships between inflation, fixed income rates and equity returns when these types of economic conditions have existed over
the previous 30 years, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Estimated future returns and other actuarially determined adjustments are also considered in calculating the estimated return on assets.  
 Generally, based on historical performance of the various investment asset classes, investments in equities have outperformed other investment classes
but are subject to higher volatility. In an effort to minimize volatility, while recognizing the long-term up-side potential of investing in equities, the Committee has determined that a target asset allocation of 43 percent global equities, 30
percent debt securities, 7 percent domestic mid-small cap equities, 5 percent emerging markets equities, 5 percent real estate equities, 5 percent hedge funds and 5 percent private equity funds is appropriate.  
 At December 31, 2015 and 2014, plan assets of the qualified pension plan included asset management arrangements with related parties totaling $63
million and $70 million, respectively.  
 
  In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, the Company groups plan assets into a three-level
hierarchy for valuation techniques used to measure their fair value based on whether the valuation inputs are observable or unobservable. Refer to Note 22 for further discussion on these levels.  
 The assets of the qualified pension plan include investments in equity and U.S. Treasury securities whose fair values are determined based on quoted
prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The qualified pension plan also invests in U.S. agency, corporate and municipal debt securities, which are all valued based on observable market prices or data
by third-party pricing services, and mutual funds which are valued based on quoted net asset values provided by the trustee of the fund; these assets are classified as Level 2. Additionally, the qualified pension plan invests in certain assets that
are valued based on net asset values as a practical expedient, including investments in collective investment funds, hedge funds, and private equity funds; the net asset values are provided by the fund trustee or administrator and are not classified
in the fair value hierarchy based on new accounting guidance issued by the FASB during 2015.  

122       

The following table summarizes the plan investment assets measured at fair value at December 31:  

(d)  
  This category consists of several investment strategies diversified across several hedge fund managers.

NOTE 18     STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION   

As part of its employee and director compensation programs, the Company currently may grant certain stock awards under
the provisions of its stock incentive plan. The plan provides for grants of options to purchase shares of common stock at a fixed price equal to the fair value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Option grants are generally exercisable up
to ten years from the date of grant. In addition, the plan provides for grants of shares of common stock or stock units that are subject to restriction on transfer prior to vesting. Most stock and unit awards vest over

three to five years and are subject to forfeiture if certain vesting requirements are not met. Stock incentive plans of acquired companies are generally terminated at the merger closing dates.
Participants under such plans receive the Company s common stock, or options to buy the Company s common stock, based on the conversion terms of the various merger agreements. At December 31, 2015, there were 47 million shares
(subject to adjustment for forfeitures) available for grant under various plans.  

STOCK OPTION AWARDS   
 The following is a summary of stock options outstanding and exercised under prior and existing stock incentive plans of the Company:  

(a)  
  Options cancelled include both non-vested (i.e., forfeitures) and vested options.     

(b)  
  Outstanding options include stock-based awards that may be forfeited in future periods. The impact of the estimated forfeitures is reflected in compensation expense.     
    
  Stock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of the award at the date of grant or modification.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, requiring the use of subjective assumptions. Because employee stock options have characteristics that differ from those of traded
options, including vesting provisions and

trading limitations that impact their liquidity, the determined value used to measure compensation expense may vary from the actual fair value of the employee stock options. The following table
includes the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted and the assumptions utilized by the Company for newly issued grants:

124       

Expected stock volatility is based on several factors including the historical volatility of the
Company s common stock, implied volatility determined from traded options and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations to estimate the

expected life of options. The risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant. The expected dividend yield is
based on the Company s expected dividend yield over the life of the options.  

The following summarizes certain stock option
activity of the Company:      
   To satisfy option exercises, the Company predominantly uses treasury stock.  
 Additional information regarding stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2015, is as follows:  
   
    RESTRICTED STOCK AND UNIT AWARDS     A summary
of the status of the Company s restricted shares of stock and unit awards is presented below:      

The total fair value of shares vested was $152 million, $139 million and $127 million for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense was $125 million, $125 million and $129 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. On an after-tax basis, stock-based
compensation was $78 million, $78 million and $80

million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, there was $158 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
share-based arrangements granted under the plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years as compensation expense.

125       

The components of income tax expense were:      
   A reconciliation of expected income tax expense at the federal statutory rate of 35 percent to the Company s applicable income tax
expense follows:      

(a)  
  Includes the resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities.     
    
  The tax effects of fair value adjustments on securities available-for-sale, derivative instruments in
cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments, pension and post-retirement plans and certain tax benefits related to stock options are recorded directly to shareholders  equity as part of other comprehensive income (loss).  
 In preparing its tax returns, the Company is required to interpret complex tax laws and regulations and utilize income and cost allocation methods to
determine its taxable income. On an ongoing basis, the Company is subject to examinations by federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities that may

give rise to differing interpretations of these complex laws, regulations and methods. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are
completed and matters are resolved. Federal tax examinations for all years ending through December 31, 2010, are completed and resolved. The Company s tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 are under
examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The years open to examination by state and local government authorities vary by jurisdiction.

A reconciliation of the changes in the federal, state
and foreign unrecognized tax position balances are summarized as follows:      

The total amount of unrecognized tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax
rate as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, were $165 million, $192 million and $181 million, respectively. The Company classifies interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions as a component of income tax expense. At
December 31, 2015, the Company s unrecognized tax position balance included $30 million in accrued interest.

During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 the Company recorded approximately $(1) million, $4 million and $(12) million, respectively, in interest on unrecognized tax
positions.    While certain examinations may be concluded, statutes may lapse or other developments may occur, the Company does not believe there will
be a significant increase or decrease in uncertain tax positions over the next twelve months.  

126       

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax effect of estimated temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting

purposes and the amounts used for the same items for income tax reporting purposes.

The significant components of the Company s net
deferred tax asset (liability) follows:      

The Company has approximately $1.1 billion of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards
which expire at various times through 2035. A substantial portion of these carryforwards relate to state-only net operating losses. These carryforwards are subject to a full valuation allowance. Management has determined it is more likely than not
the other net deferred tax assets could be realized through carry back to taxable income in prior years, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income.

At December 31, 2015, retained earnings included approximately $102 million of base year reserves of
acquired thrift institutions, for which no deferred federal income tax liability has been recognized. These base year reserves would be recaptured if the Company s banking subsidiaries cease to qualify as a bank for federal income tax purposes.
The base year reserves also remain subject to income tax penalty provisions that, in general, require recapture upon certain stock redemptions of, and excess distributions to, stockholders.

NOTE 20     DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS   

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to manage various risks and to
accommodate the business requirements of its customers. The Company recognizes all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in other assets or in other liabilities. On the date the Company enters into a derivative contract, the
derivative is designated as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, net investment hedge, or a designation is not made as it is a customer-related transaction, an economic hedge for asset/liability risk management purposes or another stand-alone
derivative created through the Company s operations ( free-standing derivative ). When a derivative is designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge, the Company performs an assessment, at inception and, at a

minimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine the effectiveness of the derivative in offsetting changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged item(s).  
  Fair Value Hedges  These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the change in fair value related to interest rate changes of its
underlying fixed-rate debt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges, and changes in the fair value of the hedged items, are recorded in earnings. All fair value hedges were highly effective for the year ended
December 31, 2015, and the change in fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness was not material.  

127       

Cash Flow Hedges  These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the forecasted cash flows
from its underlying variable-rate loans and debt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the cash flows of the hedged items are realized. If a derivative
designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss in other comprehensive income (loss) is amortized to earnings over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If a hedged forecasted
transaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in other comprehensive income (loss) is reported in earnings immediately, unless the forecasted transaction is at least reasonably possible of occurring,
whereby the amounts remain within other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2015, the Company had $67 million (net-of-tax) of realized and unrealized losses on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive
income (loss), compared with $172 million (net-of-tax) of realized and unrealized losses at December 31, 2014. The estimated amount to be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings during the next 12 months is a loss of
$68 million (net-of-tax). This amount includes gains and losses related to hedges that were terminated early for which the forecasted transactions are still probable. All cash flow hedges were highly effective for the year ended December 31,
2015, and the change in fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness was not material.     Net Investment Hedges  The Company uses forward commitments to
sell specified amounts of certain foreign currencies, and occasionally non-derivative debt instruments, to hedge the volatility of its investment in foreign businesses driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The ineffectiveness on
all net investment hedges was not material for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no non-derivative debt instruments designated as net investment hedges at December 31, 2015 or 2014.

Other Derivative Positions  The Company enters into free-standing derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk and
for other risk management purposes. These derivatives include forward commitments to sell to-be-announced securities ( TBAs ) and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans, which are used to economically hedge the interest rate
risk related to residential MLHFS and unfunded mortgage loan commitments. The Company also enters into interest rate swaps, forward commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to economically
hedge the change in the fair value of the Company s MSRs. The Company also enters into foreign currency forwards to economically hedge remeasurement gains and losses the Company recognizes on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
In addition, the Company acts as a seller and buyer of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts for its customers. The Company mitigates the market and liquidity risk associated with these customer derivatives by entering into
similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. The Company s
customer derivatives and related hedges are monitored and reviewed by the Company s Market Risk Committee, which establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company also has derivative
contracts that are created through its operations, including commitments to originate MLHFS and swap agreements related to the sale of a portion of its Class B common shares of Visa Inc. Refer to Note 22 for further information on these swap
agreements.    For additional information on the Company s purpose for entering into derivative transactions and its overall risk management
strategies, refer to  Management Discussion and Analysis   Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks  which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the derivative contracts. The
Company measures that credit risk using a credit valuation adjustment and includes it within the fair value of the derivative. The Company manages counterparty credit risk through diversification of its derivative positions among various
counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. A master netting arrangement allows two counterparties, who have multiple derivative contracts with each other, the ability to
net settle amounts under all contracts, including any related collateral, through a single payment and in a single currency. Collateral arrangements require the counterparty to deliver collateral (typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency
securities) equal to the Company s net derivative receivable, subject to minimum transfer and credit rating requirements.  

The Company s collateral arrangements are predominately bilateral and, therefore, contain provisions
that require collateralization of the Company s net liability derivative positions. Required collateral coverage is based on certain net liability thresholds and contingent upon the Company s credit rating from two of the nationally
recognized statistical rating organizations. If the Company s credit rating were to fall below credit ratings thresholds established in the collateral arrangements, the counterparties to the derivatives could request immediate additional
collateral coverage up to and including full collateral coverage for derivatives in a net liability position. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives under collateral arrangements that were in a net liability position at December 31, 2015,
was $956 million. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $823 million of cash posted as collateral against this net liability position.

NOTE 21     NETTING ARRANGEMENTS FOR CERTAIN 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES   

The majority of the Company s derivative portfolio consists of bilateral over-the-counter trades. However, current
regulations require that certain interest rate swaps and forwards and credit contracts need to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses. In addition, a portion of the Company s derivative positions are exchange-traded. These are
predominately U.S. Treasury futures or options on U.S. Treasury futures. Of the Company s $202.4 billion total notional amount of derivative positions at December 31, 2015, $69.8 billion related to those centrally cleared through
clearinghouses and $8.3 billion related to those that were exchange-traded. Irrespective of how derivatives are traded, the Company s derivative contracts include offsetting rights (referred to as netting arrangements), and depending on
expected volume, credit risk, and counterparty preference, collateral maintenance may be required. For all derivatives under collateral support arrangements, fair value is determined daily and, depending on the collateral maintenance requirements,
the Company and a counterparty may receive or deliver collateral, based upon the net fair value of all derivative positions between the Company and the counterparty. Collateral is typically cash, but securities may be allowed under collateral
arrangements with certain counterparties. Receivables and payables related to cash collateral are included in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, along with the related derivative asset and liability fair values.
Any securities pledged to counterparties as collateral remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities received from counterparties as collateral are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In
general, securities

used as collateral can be sold, repledged or otherwise used by the party in possession. No restrictions exist on the use of cash collateral by either party. Refer to Note 20 for further
discussion of the Company s derivatives, including collateral arrangements.    As part of the Company s treasury and broker-dealer
operations, the Company executes transactions that are treated as securities sold under agreements to repurchase or securities purchased under agreements to resell, both of which are accounted for as collateralized financings. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase include repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions. Securities purchased under agreements to resell include reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions. For securities sold under
agreements to repurchase, the Company records a liability for the cash received, which is included in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For securities purchased under agreements to resell, the Company records a receivable for
the cash paid, which is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.    Securities transferred to counterparties under repurchase
agreements and securities loaned transactions continue to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are measured at fair value, and are included in investment securities or other assets. Securities received from counterparties under reverse
repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless the counterparty defaults. The securities transferred under repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions typically are U.S.
Treasury and  

132       

agency securities or residential agency mortgage-backed securities. The securities loaned or borrowed typically are corporate debt securities traded by the Company s broker-dealer. In
general, the securities transferred can be sold, repledged or otherwise used by the party in possession. No restrictions exist on the use of cash collateral by either party. Repurchase/reverse repurchase and securities loaned/borrowed transactions
expose the Company to counterparty risk. The Company manages this risk by performing

assessments, independent of business line managers, and establishing concentration limits on each counterparty. Additionally, these transactions include collateral arrangements that require the
fair values of the underlying securities to be determined daily, resulting in cash being obtained or refunded to counterparties to maintain specified collateral levels. At December 31, 2015, the Company had no outstanding securities loaned
transactions.  

The following table summarizes the maturities by
category of collateral pledged for repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015:      

The Company executes its derivative, repurchase/reverse repurchase and securities loaned/borrowed
transactions under the respective industry standard agreements. These agreements include master netting arrangements that allow for multiple contracts executed with the same counterparty to be viewed as a single arrangement. This allows for net
settlement of a single amount on a daily basis. In the event of default, the master netting arrangement provides for close-out netting, which allows all of these positions with the defaulting counterparty to be terminated and net settled with a
single payment amount.  
 
  The Company has elected to offset the assets and liabilities under netting arrangements for the balance
sheet presentation of the majority of its derivative counterparties, excluding centrally cleared derivative contracts due to current uncertainty about the legal enforceability of netting arrangements with the clearinghouses. The netting occurs at
the counterparty level, and includes all assets and liabilities related to the derivative contracts, including those associated with cash collateral received or delivered. The Company has not elected to offset the assets and liabilities under
netting arrangements for the balance sheet presentation of repurchase/reverse repurchase and securities loaned/borrowed transactions.

The following tables provide information on the
Company s netting adjustments, and items not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but available for offset in the event of default:      

(b)  
  For derivative assets this includes any derivative liability fair values that could be offset in the event of counterparty default; for reverse repurchase agreements this includes any repurchase agreement payables
that could be offset in the event of counterparty default; for securities borrowed this includes any securities loaned payables that could be offset in the event of counterparty default.     

(c)  
  Includes the fair value of securities received by the Company from the counterparty. These securities are not included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless the counterparty defaults.     

133       

(b)  
  For derivative liabilities this includes any derivative asset fair values that could be offset in the event of counterparty default; for repurchase agreements this includes any reverse repurchase agreement
receivables that could be offset in the event of counterparty default; for securities loaned this includes any securities borrowed receivables that could be offset in the event of counterparty default.     

(c)  
  Includes the fair value of securities pledged by the Company to the counterparty. These securities are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless the Company defaults.     

NOTE 22    FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  

The Company uses fair value measurements for the initial recording of certain assets and liabilities, periodic
remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities, and disclosures. Derivatives, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, MSRs and substantially all MLHFS are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time,
the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held for sale, loans held for investment and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of
lower-of-cost-or-fair value accounting or impairment write-downs of individual assets.    Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be
received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement
reflects all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and
the risk of nonperformance.    The Company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three-level hierarchy for valuation
techniques used to measure financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is based on whether the valuation inputs are observable or unobservable. These levels are:  

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 includes U.S. Treasury securities, as well as exchange-traded instruments, including certain perpetual preferred and corporate
debt securities.        

Level 2   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted

prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2
includes debt securities that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and which are typically valued using third party pricing services; derivative contracts and other assets and liabilities, including securities, whose value is
determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data; and MLHFS whose values are determined using quoted prices for similar assets or pricing
models with inputs that are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data.         

Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments
whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category
includes MSRs, certain debt securities and certain derivative contracts.      When the Company changes its valuation inputs for measuring
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value, either due to changes in current market conditions or other factors, it may need to transfer those assets or liabilities to another level in the hierarchy based on the new inputs used. The
Company recognizes these transfers at the end of the reporting period in which the transfers occur. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no transfers of financial assets or financial liabilities between the
hierarchy levels.  

134       

The Company has processes and controls in place to increase the reliability of estimates it makes in
determining fair value measurements. Items quoted on an exchange are verified to the quoted price. Items provided by a third party pricing service are subject to price verification procedures as described in more detail in the specific valuation
discussions below. For fair value measurements modeled internally, the Company s valuation models are subject to the Company s Model Risk Governance Policy and Program, as maintained by the Company s risk management department. The
purpose of model validation is to assess the accuracy of the models  input, processing, and reporting components. All models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use, and are subject to formal change
control procedures. Under the Company s Model Risk Governance Policy, models are required to be reviewed at least annually to ensure they are operating as intended. Inputs into the models are market observable inputs whenever available. When
market observable inputs are not available, the inputs are developed based upon analysis of historical experience and evaluation of other relevant market data. Significant unobservable model inputs are subject to review by senior management in
corporate functions, who are independent from the modeling. Significant unobservable model inputs are also compared to actual results, typically on a quarterly basis. Significant Level 3 fair value measurements are also subject to corporate-level
review and are benchmarked to market transactions or other market data, when available. Additional discussion of processes and controls are provided in the valuation methodologies section that follows.  
 The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value and for
estimating fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value as required under disclosure guidance related to the fair value of financial instruments. In addition, the following section includes an indication of the level of the fair
value hierarchy in which the assets or liabilities are classified. Where appropriate, the description includes information about the valuation models and key inputs to those models. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there
were no significant changes to the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure fair value.     Cash and Due From Banks  The carrying value of cash and due
from banks approximate fair value and are classified within Level 1. Fair value is provided for disclosure purposes only.     Federal Funds Sold and Securities
Purchased Under Resale Agreements  The carrying value of federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements approximate fair value because of the relatively short time

between the origination of the instrument and its expected realization and are classified within Level 2. Fair value is provided for disclosure purposes only.  
  Investment Securities  When quoted market prices for identical securities are available in an active market, these prices are used to determine fair value and these
securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 investment securities include U.S. Treasury and exchange-traded securities.  
 For other securities, quoted market prices may not be readily available for the specific securities. When possible, the Company determines fair value
based on market observable information, including quoted market prices for similar securities, inactive transaction prices, and broker quotes. These securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 valuations are
generally provided by a third party pricing service. The Company reviews the valuation methodologies utilized by the pricing service and, on a quarterly basis, reviews the security level prices provided by the pricing service against
management s expectation of fair value, based on changes in various benchmarks and market knowledge from recent trading activity. Additionally, each quarter, the Company validates the fair value provided by the pricing service by comparing them
to recent observable market trades (where available), broker provided quotes, or other independent secondary pricing sources. Prices obtained from the pricing service are adjusted if they are found to be inconsistent with relevant market data. Level
2 investment securities are predominantly agency mortgage-backed securities, certain other asset-backed securities, municipal securities, corporate debt securities, agency debt securities and certain perpetual preferred securities.  
 The fair value of securities for which there are no market trades, or where trading is inactive as compared to normal market activity, are classified
within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company determines the fair value of these securities by using a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporating observable market information, where available. These valuations are modeled by a
unit within the Company s treasury department. The valuations use assumptions regarding housing prices, interest rates and borrower performance. Inputs are refined and updated at least quarterly to reflect market developments and actual
performance. The primary valuation drivers of these securities are the prepayment rates, default rates and default severities associated with the underlying collateral, as well as the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the
projected cash flows. Level 3 fair values, including the assumptions used, are subject to review by senior management in corporate functions, who are independent from the modeling. The fair value measurements are also

135       

compared to fair values provided by third party pricing services and broker provided quotes, where available. Securities classified within Level 3 include non-agency mortgage-backed securities,
non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, certain asset-backed securities, certain collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations and certain corporate debt securities.  
  Mortgage Loans Held For Sale  MLHFS measured at fair value, for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist, are initially valued at
the transaction price and are subsequently valued by comparison to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are classified within Level 2. Included in mortgage banking revenue was a $27 million net gain, a $185 million net
gain and a $335 million net loss for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from the changes to fair value of these MLHFS under fair value option accounting guidance. Changes in fair value due to instrument specific
credit risk were immaterial. Interest income for MLHFS is measured based on contractual interest rates and reported as interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Electing to measure MLHFS at fair value reduces certain timing
differences and better matches changes in fair value of these assets with changes in the value of the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting.  
  Loans  The loan portfolio includes adjustable and fixed-rate loans, the fair value of which is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and other valuation
techniques. The expected cash flows of loans consider historical prepayment experiences and estimated credit losses and are discounted using current rates offered to borrowers with similar credit characteristics. Generally, loan fair values reflect
Level 3 information. Fair value is provided for disclosure purposes only, with the exception of impaired collateral-based loans that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis utilizing the underlying collateral fair value.  
  Mortgage Servicing Rights  MSRs are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology, and are classified within Level 3. The Company determines fair value by
estimating the present value of the asset s future cash flows using prepayment rates, discount rates, and other assumptions. The MSR valuations, as well as the assumptions used, are developed by the mortgage banking division and are subject to
review by senior management in corporate functions, who are independent from the modeling. The MSR valuations and assumptions are validated through comparison to trade information when available, publicly available data and industry surveys and are
also compared to independent third

party valuations each quarter. Risks inherent in MSR valuation include higher than expected prepayment rates and/or delayed receipt of cash flows. There is minimal observable market activity for
MSRs on comparable portfolios, and, therefore the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment. Refer to Note 10 for further information on MSR valuation assumptions.  
  Derivatives  The majority of derivatives held by the Company are executed over-the-counter and are valued using standard cash flow, Black-Derman-Toy and Monte Carlo
valuation techniques. The models incorporate inputs, depending on the type of derivative, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates and volatility. In addition, all derivative values incorporate an assessment of the risk of counterparty
nonperformance, measured based on the Company s evaluation of credit risk as well as external assessments of credit risk, where available. The Company monitors and manages its nonperformance risk by considering its ability to net derivative
positions under master netting arrangements, as well as collateral received or provided under collateral arrangements. Accordingly, the Company has elected to measure the fair value of derivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net basis. The
majority of the derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as the significant inputs to the models, including nonperformance risk, are observable. However, certain derivative transactions are with counterparties where
risk of nonperformance cannot be observed in the market, and therefore the credit valuation adjustments result in these derivatives being classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The credit valuation adjustments for nonperformance risk
are determined by the Company s treasury department using credit assumptions provided by the risk management department. The credit assumptions are compared to actual results quarterly and are recalibrated as appropriate.  
 The Company also has other derivative contracts that are created through its operations, including commitments to purchase and originate mortgage loans
and swap agreements executed in conjunction with the sale of a portion of its Class B common shares of Visa Inc. ( the Visa swaps ). The mortgage loan commitments are valued by pricing models that include market observable and unobservable
inputs, which result in the commitments being classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The unobservable inputs include assumptions about the percentage of commitments that actually become a closed loan and the MSR value that is
inherent in the underlying loan value, both of which are developed by the Company s mortgage banking division. The closed loan percentages for the mortgage loan commitments are monitored on an on-going basis, as these percentages are also used
for the Company s economic hedging activities.  

136       

The inherent MSR value for the commitments are generated by the same models used for the Company s MSRs and thus are subject to the same processes and controls as described for the MSRs
above. The Visa swaps require payments by either the Company or the purchaser of the Visa Inc. Class B common shares when there are changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Inc. Class B common shares to Visa Inc. Class A common shares, as
well as quarterly payments to the purchaser based on specified terms of the agreements. Management reviews and updates the Visa swaps fair value in conjunction with its review of Visa related litigation contingencies, and the associated escrow
funding. The fair value of the Visa swaps are calculated by the Company s corporate development department using a discounted cash flow methodology which includes unobservable inputs about the timing and settlement amounts related to the
resolution of certain Visa related litigation. The expected litigation resolution impacts the Visa Inc. Class B common share to Visa Inc. Class A common share conversion rate, as well as the ultimate termination date for the Visa swaps.
Accordingly, the Visa swaps are classified within Level 3. Refer to Note 23 for further information on the Visa restructuring and related card association litigation.  
  Other Financial Instruments  Other financial instruments include cost method equity investments and certain community development and tax-advantaged related assets
and liabilities. The majority of the Company s cost method equity investments are in Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank stock, for which the carrying amounts approximate fair value and are classified within Level 2. Investments in
other equity and limited partnership funds are estimated using fund provided net asset values. These equity investments are classified within Level 3. The community development and tax-advantaged related asset balances primarily represent the
underlying assets of consolidated community development and tax-advantaged entities. The community development and tax-advantaged related liabilities represent the underlying liabilities of the consolidated entities (included in long-term debt) and
liabilities related to other third party interests (included in other liabilities). The carrying value of the community development and tax-advantaged related asset and other liability balances are a reasonable estimate of fair value and are
classified within Level 3. Refer to Note 8 for further information on community development and tax-advantaged related assets and liabilities. Fair value is provided for disclosure purposes only.  
  Deposit Liabilities  The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is equal to the amount payable on demand. The fair value
of fixed-rate

certificates of deposit was estimated by discounting the contractual cash flow using current market rates. Deposit liabilities are classified within Level 2. Fair value is provided for disclosure
purposes only.     Short-term Borrowings  Federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, commercial paper and other short-term funds
borrowed have floating rates or short-term maturities. The fair value of short-term borrowings was determined by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates. Short-term borrowings are classified within Level 2. Included in
short-term borrowings is the Company s obligation on securities sold short, which is required to be accounted for at fair value per applicable accounting guidance. Fair value for other short-term borrowings is provided for disclosure purposes
only.     Long-term Debt  The fair value for most long-term debt was determined by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates. Junior
subordinated debt instruments were valued using market quotes. Long-term debt is classified within Level 2. Fair value is provided for disclosure purposes only.  
  Loan Commitments, Letters of Credit and Guarantees  The fair value of commitments, letters of credit and guarantees represents the estimated costs to terminate or
otherwise settle the obligations with a third party. Other loan commitments, letters of credit and guarantees are not actively traded, and the Company estimates their fair value based on the related amount of unamortized deferred commitment fees
adjusted for the probable losses for these arrangements. These arrangements are classified within Level 3. Fair value is provided for disclosure purposes only.  
  SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS OF LEVEL 3 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES     The
following section provides information on the significant inputs used by the Company to determine the fair value measurements of Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, the following
section includes a discussion of the sensitivity of the fair value measurements to changes in the significant inputs and a description of any interrelationships between these inputs for Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis. The discussion below excludes nonrecurring fair value measurements of collateral value used for impairment measures for loans and OREO. These valuations utilize third party appraisal or broker price opinions, and are classified as
Level 3 due to the significant judgment involved.

Available-For-Sale Investment Securities  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of
the Company s modeled Level 3 available-for-sale investment securities are prepayment rates, probability of default and loss severities associated with the underlying collateral, as well as the discount margin used to calculate the present
value of the projected cash flows. Increases in prepayment rates for Level 3 securities will typically result in higher fair values, as increased prepayment rates accelerate the receipt of expected cash flows and reduce exposure to credit losses.
Increases in the probability of default and loss severities will result in lower fair values, as these increases reduce expected cash flows. Discount margin is the Company s estimate of the current market spread above the respective benchmark
rate.

Higher discount margin will result in lower fair values, as it reduces the present value of the expected cash flows.  
 Prepayment rates generally move in the opposite direction of market interest rates. In the current environment, an increase in the probability of
default will generally be accompanied with an increase in loss severity, as both are impacted by underlying collateral values. Discount margins are influenced by market expectations about the security s collateral performance, and therefore may
directionally move with probability and severity of default; however, discount margins are also impacted by broader market forces, such as competing investment yields, sector liquidity, economic news, and other macroeconomic factors.

(a)  
  Prime securities are those designated as such by the issuer at origination. When an issuer designation is unavailable, the Company determines at acquisition date the categorization based on asset pool characteristics
(such as weighted-average credit score, loan-to-value, loan type, prevalence of low documentation loans) and deal performance (such as pool delinquencies and security market spreads).     

(b)  
  Includes all securities not meeting the conditions to be designated as prime.     
    
   Mortgage Servicing Rights  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the
Company s MSRs are expected prepayments and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows. Significant increases in either of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value
measurement.

Significant decreases in either of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement. There is no direct interrelationship between prepayments and discount
rate. Prepayment rates generally move in the opposite direction of market interest rates. Discount rates are generally impacted by changes in market return requirements.

The following table shows the significant valuation
assumption ranges for MSRs at December 31, 2015:      

Derivatives  The Company has two distinct Level 3 derivative portfolios: (i) the Company s commitments to
purchase and originate mortgage loans that meet the requirements of a derivative and (ii) the Company s asset/liability and
customer- 

related derivatives that are Level 3 due to unobservable inputs related to measurement of risk of nonperformance by the counterparty. In addition, the Company s Visa swaps are classified
within Level 3.  

138       

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s derivative
commitments to purchase and originate mortgage loans are the percentage of commitments that actually become a closed loan and the MSR value that is inherent in the underlying loan value. A significant increase in the rate of loans that close would
result

in a larger derivative asset or liability. A significant increase in the inherent MSR value would result in an increase in the derivative asset or a reduction in the derivative liability.
Expected loan close rates and the inherent MSR values are directly impacted by changes in market rates and will generally move in the same direction as interest rates.

The following table shows the significant valuation
assumption ranges for the Company s derivative commitments to purchase and originate mortgage loans at December 31, 2015:      

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of certain of the Company s
asset/liability and customer-related derivatives is the credit valuation adjustment related to the risk of counterparty nonperformance. A significant increase in the credit valuation adjustment would result in a lower fair value measurement. A
significant decrease in the credit valuation adjustment would result in a higher fair value measurement. The credit valuation adjustment is impacted by changes in the Company s assessment of the counterparty s credit position. At
December 31, 2015, the minimum, maximum and average credit valuation adjustment as a percentage of the derivative

contract fair value prior to adjustment was 0 percent, 98 percent and 5 percent, respectively.  
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Visa swaps are management s estimate of the probability of certain
litigation scenarios, and the timing of the resolution of the related litigation loss estimates in excess, or shortfall, of the Company s proportional share of escrow funds. An increase in the loss estimate or a delay in the resolution of the
related litigation would result in an increase in the derivative liability. A decrease in the loss estimate or an acceleration of the resolution of the related litigation would result in a decrease in the derivative liability.

The following table summarizes the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  

(a)  
  Prime securities are those designated as such by the issuer at origination. When an issuer designation is unavailable, the Company determines at acquisition date the categorization based on asset pool characteristics
(such as weighted-average credit score, loan-to-value, loan type, prevalence of low documentation loans) and deal performance (such as pool delinquencies and security market spreads).     

(b)  
  Includes all securities not meeting the conditions to be designated as prime.     

(c)  
  Represents the Company s obligation on securities sold short required to be accounted for at fair value per applicable accounting guidance.

      141       

The Company is also required periodically to measure certain other financial assets at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis.    These measurements of fair value usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-fair value accounting or write-downs of individual
assets.    The following table summarizes the balances as of the measurement date of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, and still held as of the
reporting date as of December 31:      

(a)  
  Represents the carrying value of loans for which adjustments were based on the fair value of the collateral, excluding loans fully charged-off.     

(b)  
  Primarily represents the fair value of foreclosed properties that were measured at fair value based on an appraisal or broker price opinion of the collateral subsequent to their initial acquisition.
      The following table summarizes losses recognized related to nonrecurring fair value measurements of individual assets or portfolios for the years
ended December 31:      

(a)  
  Represents write-downs of student loans held for sale based on non-binding quoted prices received for the portfolio, that were subsequently transferred to loans, and write-downs of loans which were based on the fair
value of the collateral, excluding loans fully charged-off.     

(b)  
  Primarily represents related losses of foreclosed properties that were measured at fair value subsequent to their initial acquisition.     
  FAIR VALUE OPTION     The following table summarizes the differences between the
aggregate fair value carrying amount of MLHFS for which the fair value option has been elected and the aggregate unpaid principal amount that the Company is contractually obligated to receive at maturity as of December 31:  

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   
 The following table summarizes the estimated fair value for financial instruments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and includes financial instruments that are not
accounted for at fair value. In accordance with disclosure guidance related to fair values of financial instruments, the Company did not include

assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments, such as the value of goodwill, long-term relationships with deposit, credit card, merchant processing and trust customers, other
purchased intangibles, premises and equipment, deferred taxes and other liabilities. Additionally, in accordance with the disclosure guidance, insurance contracts and investments accounted for under the equity method are excluded.

142       

The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments as of December 31, are shown in the table below:

(a)  
  Excludes mortgages held for sale for which the fair value option under applicable accounting guidance was elected.     

(b)  
  Excludes loans measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.     

(c)  
  Excludes the Company s obligation on securities sold short required to be accounted for at fair value per applicable accounting guidance.     
    
  The fair value of unfunded commitments, deferred non-yield related loan fees, standby letters of credit
and other guarantees is approximately equal to their carrying value. The carrying value of unfunded commitments, deferred non-yield related loan fees

and standby letters of credit was $515 million and $413 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The carrying value of other guarantees was $184 million and $211 million at
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

NOTE 23    GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES  

Visa Restructuring and Card Association Litigation  The Company s payment services business issues and
acquires credit and debit card transactions through the Visa U.S.A. Inc. card association or its affiliates (collectively  Visa ). In 2007, Visa completed a restructuring and issued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its financial
institution members in contemplation of its initial public offering ( IPO ) completed in the first quarter of 2008 (the  Visa Reorganization ). As a part of the Visa Reorganization, the Company received its proportionate number
of shares of Visa Inc. common stock, which were subsequently converted to Class B shares of Visa Inc. ( Class B shares ). Visa U.S.A. Inc. ( Visa U.S.A. ) and MasterCard International (collectively, the  Card
Associations ) are defendants in antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of the Card Associations (the  Visa Litigation ). Visa U.S.A. member banks have a contingent obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A. bylaws
(which were modified at the time of the restructuring in October 2007) for potential losses arising from the Visa Litigation. The indemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member banks has no specific maximum amount.  
 Using proceeds from its IPO and through reductions to the conversion ratio applicable to the Class B shares held by Visa U.S.A. member banks, Visa Inc.
has funded an escrow account for the benefit of member financial institutions to fund

their indemnification obligations associated with the Visa Litigation. The receivable related to the escrow account is classified in other liabilities as a direct offset to the related Visa
Litigation contingent liability. On October 19, 2012, Visa signed a settlement agreement to resolve class action claims associated with the multi-district interchange litigation, the largest of the remaining Visa Litigation matters. The
settlement has been approved by the court, but has been challenged by some class members and is being appealed. In addition, a number of class members opted out of the settlement and have filed actions against the Card Associations. At
December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the Company s liability related to the Visa Litigation matters, net of its share of the escrow fundings, was $19 million. During 2015, the Company sold 2.5 million of its Class B shares.
These sales, and any previous sales of its Class B shares, do not impact the Company s liability for the Visa Litigation matters or the receivable related to the escrow account. The remaining 6.4 million Class B shares held by the
Company will be eligible for conversion to Class A shares of Visa Inc., and thereby become marketable, upon final settlement of the Visa Litigation. These shares are excluded from the Company s financial instruments disclosures included in
Note 22.  

143       

Commitments to Extend Credit  Commitments to extend credit are legally binding and generally have fixed expiration
dates or other termination clauses. The contractual amount represents the Company s exposure to credit loss, in the event of default by the borrower. The Company manages this credit risk by using the same credit policies it applies to loans.
Collateral is obtained to secure commitments based on management s credit assessment of the borrower. The collateral may include marketable securities, receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate. Since the Company expects many of the
commitments to expire without being drawn, total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent the Company s future liquidity requirements. In addition, the commitments include consumer credit lines that are cancelable upon notification to
the consumer.    The contract or notional amounts of unfunded commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2015, excluding those commitments considered
derivatives, were as follows:      

(a)  
  Primarily cancelable at the Company s discretion.        Lease Commitments  Rental expense for operating
leases totaled $328 million in 2015, $326 million in 2014 and $311 million in 2013. Future minimum payments, net of sublease rentals, under capitalized leases and noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one
year or more, consisted of the following at December 31, 2015:      

OTHER GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES   
 The following table is a summary of other guarantees and contingent liabilities of the Company at December 31, 2015:  
   
    Letters of Credit  Standby letters of credit are commitments the Company issues to guarantee the performance of a customer to a
third party. The guarantees frequently support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper issuances, bond financings and other similar transactions. The Company also issues and confirms commercial letters of credit on
behalf of customers to ensure payment or collection in connection with trade transactions. In the event of a customer s or counterparty s nonperformance, the Company s credit loss exposure is similar to that in any extension of
credit, up to the letter s contractual amount. Management assesses the borrower s credit to determine the necessary collateral, which may include marketable securities, receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate. Since the
conditions requiring the Company to fund letters of credit may not occur, the Company expects its liquidity requirements to be less than the total outstanding commitments. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under standby
letter of credit arrangements at December 31, 2015, were approximately $13.0 billion with a weighted-average term of approximately 21 months. The estimated fair value of standby letters of credit was approximately $57 million at
December 31, 2015.    The contract or notional amount of letters of credit at December 31, 2015, were as follows:  

144       

Guarantees  Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the Company to customers or other third parties. The
Company s guarantees primarily include parent guarantees related to subsidiaries  third party borrowing arrangements; third party performance guarantees inherent in the Company s business operations, such as indemnified securities
lending programs and merchant charge-back guarantees; indemnification or buy-back provisions related to certain asset sales; and contingent consideration arrangements related to acquisitions. For certain guarantees, the Company has recorded a
liability related to the potential obligation, or has access to collateral to support the guarantee or through the exercise of other recourse provisions can offset some or all of the maximum potential future payments made under these guarantees.
     Third Party Borrowing Arrangements   The Company provides guarantees to third parties as a part of certain subsidiaries  borrowing arrangements. The
maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements were approximately $8 million at December 31, 2015.      Commitments
from Securities Lending   The Company participates in securities lending activities by acting as the customer s agent involving the loan of securities. The Company indemnifies customers for the difference between the fair value of the
securities lent and the fair value of the collateral received. Cash collateralizes these transactions. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements were approximately $4.2 billion at December 31,
2015, and represent the fair value of the securities lent to third parties. At December 31, 2015, the Company held $4.4 billion of cash as collateral for these arrangements.  
   Asset Sales   The Company has provided guarantees to certain third parties in connection with the sale or syndication of certain assets, primarily loan
portfolios and tax-advantaged investments. These guarantees are generally in the form of asset buy-back or make-whole provisions that are triggered upon a credit event or a change in the tax-qualifying status of the related projects, as applicable,
and remain in effect until the loans are collected or final tax credits are realized, respectively. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements were approximately $5.1 billion at December 31, 2015,
and represented the proceeds received from the buyer or the guaranteed portion in these transactions where the buy-back or make-whole provisions have not yet expired. At December 31, 2015, the Company had reserved $89 million for potential
losses related to the sale or syndication of tax- advantaged investments.

The maximum potential future payments do not include loan sales where the Company provides standard
representation and warranties to the buyer against losses related to loan underwriting documentation defects that may have existed at the time of sale that generally are identified after the occurrence of a triggering event such as delinquency. For
these types of loan sales, the maximum potential future payments is generally the unpaid principal balance of loans sold measured at the end of the current reporting period. Actual losses will be significantly less than the maximum exposure, as only
a fraction of loans sold will have a representation and warranty breach, and any losses on repurchase would generally be mitigated by any collateral held against the loans.  
 The Company regularly sells loans to GSEs as part of its mortgage banking activities. The Company provides customary representations and warranties to
the GSEs in conjunction with these sales. These representations and warranties generally require the Company to repurchase assets if it is subsequently determined that a loan did not meet specified criteria, such as a documentation deficiency or
rescission of mortgage insurance. If the Company is unable to cure or refute a repurchase request, the Company is generally obligated to repurchase the loan or otherwise reimburse the counterparty for losses. At December 31, 2015, the Company
had reserved $30 million for potential losses from representation and warranty obligations, compared with $46 million at December 31, 2014. The Company s reserve reflects management s best estimate of losses for representation and
warranty obligations. The Company s repurchase reserve is modeled at the loan level, taking into consideration the individual credit quality and borrower activity that has transpired since origination. The model applies credit quality and
economic risk factors to derive a probability of default and potential repurchase that are based on the Company s historical loss experience, and estimates loss severity based on expected collateral value. The Company also considers qualitative
factors that may result in anticipated losses differing from historical loss trends.    As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $12
million and $19 million, respectively, of unresolved representation and warranty claims from the GSEs. The Company does not have a significant amount of unresolved claims from investors other than the GSEs.  
   Merchant Processing   The Company, through its subsidiaries, provides merchant processing services. Under the rules of credit card associations, a
merchant processor retains a contingent liability for credit card transactions processed. This contingent liability arises in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder s
favor. In this situation,  

145       

the transaction is  charged-back  to the merchant and the disputed amount is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the Company is unable to collect this amount from the
merchant, it bears the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder.    A cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally has until the
later of up to four months after the date the transaction is processed or the receipt of the product or service to present a charge-back to the Company as the merchant processor. The absolute maximum potential liability is estimated to be the total
volume of credit card transactions that meet the associations  requirements to be valid charge-back transactions at any given time. Management estimates that the maximum potential exposure for charge-backs would approximate the total amount of
merchant transactions processed through the credit card associations for the last four months. For the last four months this amount totaled approximately $95.0 billion. In most cases, this contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products
and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants. However, where the product or service has been purchased but is not provided until a future date ( future delivery ), the potential
for this contingent liability increases. To mitigate this risk, the Company may require the merchant to make an escrow deposit, place maximum volume limitations on future delivery transactions processed by the merchant at any point in time, or
require various credit enhancements (including letters of credit and bank guarantees). Also, merchant processing contracts may include event triggers to provide the Company more financial and operational control in the event of financial
deterioration of the merchant.    The Company currently processes card transactions in the United States, Canada, Europe, Mexico and Brazil through
wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures with other financial institutions. In the event a merchant was unable to fulfill product or services subject to future delivery, such as airline tickets, the Company could become financially liable for
refunding tickets purchased through the credit card associations under the charge-back provisions. Charge-back risk related to these merchants is evaluated in a manner similar to credit risk assessments and, as such, merchant processing contracts
contain various provisions to protect the Company in the event of default. At December 31, 2015, the value of airline tickets purchased to be delivered at a future date was $6.7 billion. The Company held collateral of $307 million in escrow
deposits, letters of credit and indemnities from financial institutions, and liens on various assets. With respect to future delivery risk for other merchants, the Company held $26 million of merchant escrow deposits as collateral. In addition to
specific collateral or other credit

enhancements, the Company maintains a liability for its implied guarantees associated with future delivery. At December 31, 2015, the liability was $49 million primarily related to these
airline processing arrangements.    In the normal course of business, the Company has unresolved charge-backs. The Company assesses the likelihood of
its potential liability based on the extent and nature of unresolved charge-backs and its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2015, the Company held $76 million of merchant escrow deposits as collateral and had a recorded liability for
potential losses of $12 million.      Contingent Consideration Arrangements   The Company has contingent payment obligations related to certain business
combination transactions. Payments are guaranteed as long as certain post-acquisition performance-based criteria are met or customer relationships are maintained. At December 31, 2015, the maximum potential future payments required to be made
by the Company under these arrangements was approximately $2 million. If required, the majority of these contingent payments are payable within the next 12 months.  
   Tender Option Bond Program Guarantee   As discussed in Note 8, the Company sponsors a municipal bond securities tender option bond program and consolidates
the program s entities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company provides financial performance guarantees related to the program s entities. At December 31, 2015, the Company guaranteed $2.2 billion of borrowings of the
program s entities, included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in short-term borrowings. The Company also included on its Consolidated Balance Sheet the related $2.3 billion of available-for-sale investment securities serving as collateral for
this arrangement.      Minimum Revenue Guarantees   In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into revenue share agreements with third party
business partners who generate customer referrals or provide marketing or other services related to the generation of revenue. In certain of these agreements, the Company may guarantee that a minimum amount of revenue share payments will be made to
the third party over a specified period of time. At December 31, 2015, the maximum potential future payments required to be made by the Company under these agreements were $12 million.  
   Other Guarantees and Commitments   The Company has also made other financial performance guarantees and commitments primarily related to the operations of its
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015, the maximum potential future payments guaranteed or committed by the Company under these arrangements were approximately $792 million.

146       

Litigation and Regulatory Matters  The Company is subject to various litigation and regulatory matters that arise in
the ordinary course of its business. The Company establishes reserves for such matters when potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes the ultimate resolution of existing legal and regulatory matters will
not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. However, changes in circumstances or additional information could result in additional accruals or resolution in excess of established
accruals, which could adversely affect the Company s results from operations, potentially materially.      Litigation Matters   In the last several
years, the Company and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee for residential mortgage backed securities trusts. Among these lawsuits are actions originally brought in June 2014 by a group of
institutional investors, including BlackRock and PIMCO funds, against six bank trustees, including the Company. These actions are in early stages and currently are pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these lawsuits, the investors allege that U.S. Bank National Association as trustee caused them to incur substantial losses by failing to enforce loan repurchase obligations and
failing to abide by appropriate standards of care after events of default allegedly occurred. The plaintiffs seek monetary damages in an unspecified amount and also seek equitable relief.  
   Regulatory Matters   The Company is currently subject to examinations, inquiries and investigations by government agencies and bank regulators concerning
mortgage-related practices, including those related to compliance with selling guidelines relating to residential home loans sold to GSEs, foreclosure-related expenses submitted to the Federal Housing Administration or GSEs for reimbursement,
lender-placed insurance, and notices and filings in bankruptcy cases. The Company is also subject to ongoing examinations, inquiries and investigations by government agencies, bank regulators and law enforcement with respect to Bank Secrecy
Act/anti-money laundering compliance program adequacy and effectiveness and sanctions compliance requirements as administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In October 2015, the Company entered into a Consent Order with the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (the  OCC ) concerning deficiencies in its Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance program, and requiring an ongoing review of that program. If the Company does not satisfactorily correct the
identified deficiencies, it could be required to enter into further orders, pay fines or penalties or further modify its business practices. Some of the compliance program

enhancements and other actions required by the Consent Order have already been, or are currently in the process of being, implemented, and are not expected to be material to the Company.  
 The Company is also continually subject to examinations, inquiries and investigations in areas of increasing regulatory scrutiny, such as compliance,
risk management, third party risk management and consumer protection.    The Company is cooperating fully with all pending examinations, inquiries and
investigations, any of which could lead to administrative or legal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in these proceedings or settlements may include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in the Company s business practices (which may
increase the Company s operating expenses and decrease its revenue).    Certain federal and state governmental authorities reached settlement
agreements in 2012 and 2013 with other major financial institutions regarding their mortgage origination, servicing, and foreclosure activities. Those governmental authorities have had settlement discussions with other financial institutions,
including the Company. The Company has not agreed to any settlement; however, if a settlement were reached it would likely include an agreement to comply with specified servicing standards, and settlement payments to governmental authorities as well
as a monetary commitment that could be satisfied under various loan modification programs (in addition to the programs the Company already has in place).  
 In April 2011, the Company and certain other large financial institutions entered into Consent Orders with the OCC and the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System relating to residential mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices. In June 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the 2011 Consent Order it had with the OCC. The OCC terminated the amended Consent Order
in February 2016. Depending on the Company s progress toward addressing the requirements of the 2011 Consent Order it has with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Company may be required to enter into further orders and
settlements, pay additional fines or penalties, make restitution or further modify the Company s business practices (which may increase the Company s operating expenses and decrease its revenue).  
   Outlook   Due to their complex nature, it can be years before litigation and regulatory matters are resolved. The Company may be unable to develop an estimate
or range of loss where matters are in early stages, there are significant factual or legal issues to be resolved, damages are unspecified or uncertain, or there is uncertainty as to a litigation class being certified or the outcome of pending
motions, appeals or proceedings. For those litigation and regulatory matters where

147       

the Company has information to develop an estimate or range of loss, the Company believes the upper end of reasonably possible losses in aggregate, in excess of any reserves established for
matters where a loss is considered probable, will not be material to its financial condition, results of

operations or cash flows. The Company s estimates are subject to significant judgment and uncertainties, and the matters underlying the estimates will change from time to time. Actual
results may vary significantly from the current estimates.

Company Information   
    
   General Business Description  U.S. Bancorp is a multi-state financial services holding company headquartered in
Minneapolis, Minnesota. U.S. Bancorp was incorporated in Delaware in 1929 and operates as a financial holding company and a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Company provides a full range of financial services,
including lending and depository services, cash management, capital markets, and trust and investment management services. It also engages in credit card services, merchant and ATM processing, mortgage banking, insurance, brokerage and leasing.  
 U.S. Bancorp s banking subsidiary is engaged in the general banking business, principally in domestic markets. The subsidiary, with $310 billion in
deposits at December 31, 2015, provides a wide range of products and services to individuals, businesses, institutional organizations, governmental entities and other financial institutions. Commercial and consumer lending services are
principally offered to customers within the Company s domestic markets, to domestic customers with foreign operations and to large national customers operating in specific industries targeted by the Company. Lending services include traditional
credit products as well as credit card services, lease financing and import/export trade, asset-backed lending, agricultural finance and other products. Depository services include checking accounts, savings accounts and time certificate contracts.
Ancillary services such as capital markets, treasury management and receivable lock-box collection are provided to corporate customers. U.S. Bancorp s bank and trust subsidiaries provide a full range of asset management and fiduciary
services for individuals, estates, foundations, business corporations and charitable organizations.    Other U.S. Bancorp non-banking subsidiaries
offer investment and insurance products to the Company s customers principally within its markets, and fund administration services to a broad range of mutual and other funds.  
 Banking and investment services are provided through a network of 3,133 banking offices principally operating in the Midwest and West regions of the
United States, through on-line services and over mobile devices. The Company operates a network of 4,936 ATMs and provides 24-hour, seven day a week telephone customer service. Mortgage banking services are provided through banking offices and loan
production offices throughout the Company s markets. Lending products may be originated through banking offices, indirect correspondents, brokers or other lending sources. The Company is also one of the largest providers of corporate and
purchasing card services and corporate trust services in the

United States. A wholly-owned subsidiary, Elavon, Inc. ( Elavon ), provides merchant processing services directly to merchants and through a network of banking affiliations.
Wholly-owned subsidiaries, and affiliates of Elavon, provide similar merchant services in Canada, Mexico, Brazil and segments of Europe directly or through joint ventures with other financial institutions. The Company also provides corporate trust
and fund administration services in Europe. These foreign operations are not significant to the Company.    On a full-time equivalent basis, as of
December 31, 2015, U.S. Bancorp employed 65,433 people.     Risk Factors  An investment in the Company involves risk, including the possibility that the value
of the investment could fall substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could be reduced or eliminated. Below are risk factors that could adversely affect the Company s financial results and condition and the
value of, and return on, an investment in the Company.     REGULATORY AND LEGAL RISK   
  The Company is subject to extensive and expanding government regulation and supervision, which can lead to costly enforcement actions while increasing the cost of
doing business and limiting the Company s ability to generate revenue  Federal and state regulation and supervision has increased in recent years due to the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the
 Dodd-Frank Act ) and other financial reform initiatives. The Company will continue to face such increased regulation into 2016 and in future years, as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide economic stimulus,
financial market stability, and enhancement of the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors  funds, the federal Deposit Insurance Fund, and the banking system as a whole,
and not the Company s debt holders or shareholders. These regulations, and the Company s inability to act in certain instances without receiving prior regulatory approval, affect the Company s lending practices, capital structure,
investment practices, dividend policy, ability to repurchase common stock, and ability to pursue strategic acquisitions, among other things.  
 Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, or their interpretation or implementation, and/or the continued heightening of regulatory
practices, requirements or expectations, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. For example, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency s (the  OCC s ) Guidelines for

156       

Heightened Standards and the Federal Reserve s Enhanced Prudential Supervision Rules have required and will continue to require significant Board of Directors oversight and management focus
on governance and risk-management activities. The OCC has also recently proposed guidelines that, if implemented, will require banks to develop and maintain a recovery plan subject to regulatory review, which could present new challenges and demands
on resources. In addition, many parts of the Dodd-Frank Act are still in the implementation stage, which leaves some uncertainty as to its fully implemented aggregate impact upon the Company.  
 The financial services industry is facing more intense scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of
regulations on both the federal and state levels, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices and other consumer compliance matters, and compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering requirements and sanctions compliance
requirements as administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In accordance with this trend, the Company entered into a Consent Order with the OCC in October 2015 that concerns deficiencies in its Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering
compliance program, and requires an ongoing review of that program. Federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess significant
civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines, or restitution; to issue cease and desist or removal orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. These enforcement actions may be initiated
for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. If the Company does not make satisfactory progress toward addressing the requirements of the October 2015 Consent Order, for example, it may be required to enter into further
orders and settlements, pay fines or other penalties or further modify its business practices (which may increase the Company s operating expenses and decrease its revenue). Foreign supervisors also have increased regulatory scrutiny and
enforcement in areas related to consumer compliance, money laundering, and information technology systems and controls, among others. Any future enforcement action could have a material adverse impact on the Company.  
 In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations and the severity of other terms of regulatory
settlements have been increasing dramatically and are likely to continue to increase. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant
consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the

ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. Violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in
risk management practices also may be incorporated into the Company s bank supervisory ratings. A downgrade in these ratings, or other regulatory actions and settlements, such as the October 2015 Consent Order, can limit the Company s
ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities for a period of time and require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities.  
 Compliance with new regulations and supervisory initiatives may continue to increase the Company s costs. In addition, regulatory changes may
reduce the Company s revenues, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer, alter the investments it makes, affect the manner in which it operates its businesses, increase its litigation and regulatory costs should it fail
to appropriately comply with new laws and regulatory requirements, and increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. See  Supervision and Regulation  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for additional information regarding the extensive regulatory framework applicable to the Company.     More stringent requirements related to capital and liquidity
have been adopted by U.S. banking regulators that may limit the Company s ability to return earnings to shareholders or operate or invest in its business  U.S. banking regulators have adopted more stringent capital- and liquidity-related
standards applicable to larger banking organizations, including the Company. The rules require banks to hold more and higher quality capital as well as sufficient unencumbered liquid assets to meet certain stress scenarios defined by regulation. The
implementation of these rules including the common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer, or additional capital- and liquidity-related rules could require the Company to take further steps to increase its capital, increase its investment
security holdings, divest assets or operations or otherwise change aspects of its capital and/or liquidity measures, including in ways that may be dilutive to shareholders or could limit the Company s ability to pay common stock dividends,
repurchase its common stock, invest in its businesses or provide loans to its customers. See  Supervision and Regulation  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the capital and liquidity
requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III.    Additional requirements are expected in the future. The Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System has recently proposed a policy statement that details the  

157       

framework it would follow in setting the countercyclical capital buffer, a macroprudential tool that would raise capital requirements when there is an elevated risk of above normal losses in the
U.S. financial system. Furthermore, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the  Basel Committee ) has published several consultative papers regarding (i) the standardized approach to credit risk, (ii) a fundamental review of the
trading book, (iii) interest rate risk in the banking book, and (iv) operational risk. Finally, the Basel Committee has published its final net stable funding ratio framework. The U.S. banking regulators are expected to incorporate all of these
measures into domestic regulation. The ultimate impact on the Company s capital and liquidity will depend on the final U.S. rulemakings and implementation process thereafter.  
  The Company is subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential legal liability and governmental actions  The Company faces significant legal
risks in its business, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and governmental proceedings against it and other financial institutions are increasing. Customers, clients and other counterparties have grown
more litigious and are making claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages, while banking regulators and certain other governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Department of Justice, have demonstrated an increasing focus on
enforcement, including in connection with alleged violations of law and customer harm. In addition, governmental authorities have begun to seek criminal penalties against companies in the financial services sector for regulatory violations and have
begun to require an admission of wrongdoing from financial institutions in connection with settling such matters. Criminal convictions or admissions of wrongdoing in a settlement with the government can lead to greater exposure in civil litigation
and reputational harm.    As an example of increased risks arising from litigation, the Company and other large financial institutions have been sued
over the past several years in their capacity as trustee for residential mortgage backed securities ( RMBS ) trusts. The plaintiffs in these actions allege that the significant losses they incurred as investors in the RMBS trusts were
caused by the trustees  failure to enforce loan repurchase obligations and to abide by appropriate standards of care after events of default allegedly occurred, while also arguing to broaden the trustees  duties. Although the Company has
denied liability and believes it has meritorious defenses in these cases, any finding of liability or new or enhanced duties in one or more of these cases against the Company, or another financial institution, could result in a significant financial
loss or require a modification to the Company s business practices, which could negatively impact the Company s financial results.  
 Increased litigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant governmental action against the Company could

materially impact its financial condition and results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to the Company, which in turn could adversely impact its business prospects.  
  The Company faces increased regulatory and legal risk arising out of its mortgage lending and servicing businesses  The Company is subject to investigations,
examinations and inquiries by government agencies and bank regulators concerning mortgage-related practices, including those related to compliance with selling guidelines relating to residential home loans sold to GSEs, foreclosure-related expenses
submitted to the Federal Housing Administration or GSEs for reimbursement, lender-placed insurance, and notices and filings in bankruptcy cases. The Company is cooperating fully with these investigations, examinations and inquiries, any of which
could lead to administrative or legal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in such proceedings or settlements may include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations to the Company s business practices, which could increase the Company s
operating expenses and decrease its revenue. Additionally, reputational damage arising from these or other inquiries and industry-wide publicity could also have an adverse effect upon the Company s existing mortgage business and could reduce
future business opportunities.    In addition to governmental or regulatory investigations, the Company, like other companies with residential
mortgage origination and servicing operations, faces the risk of class actions and other litigation arising out of these operations.     The Company may be required
to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties  When the Company sells mortgage loans that it has originated to various parties, including GSEs, it is
required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. The Company may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or be subject to indemnification claims in the
event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a certain period. Contracts for residential mortgage loan sales to the GSEs include various types of specific remedies and penalties that could be applied to
inadequate responses to repurchase requests. If economic conditions and the housing market deteriorate or the GSEs increase their claims of breached representations and warranties, the Company could have increased repurchase obligations and
increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring material increases to its repurchase reserve.     The Company is exposed to risk of environmental liability when it
takes title to properties  In the course of the Company s business, the Company may foreclose on and

158       

take title to real estate. As a result, the Company could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. The Company may be held liable to a governmental entity or to
third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical
releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if the Company is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, it may be subject to common law claims by third parties
based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If the Company becomes subject to significant environmental liabilities, its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.     ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS RISK      Deterioration in
business and economic conditions could adversely affect the financial services industry, and a reversal or slowing of the current economic recovery could adversely affect the Company s lending business and the value of loans and debt securities
it holds  The Company s business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and abroad, including factors such as the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation,
home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and
credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets, and the strength of the domestic and global economies in which the Company operates. The deterioration of any of these conditions can adversely affect the Company s consumer
and commercial businesses and securities portfolios, its level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, its capital levels and liquidity, and its results of operations.  
 Given the high percentage of the Company s assets represented directly or indirectly by loans, and the importance of lending to its overall
business, weak economic conditions are likely to have a negative impact on the Company s business and results of operations. A reversal or slowing of the current economic recovery or another severe contraction could adversely impact loan
utilization rates as well as delinquencies, defaults and customer ability to meet obligations under the loans. The value to the Company of other assets such as investment securities, most of which are debt securities or other financial instruments
supported by loans, similarly would be negatively impacted by widespread decreases in credit quality resulting from a weakening of the

economy. Downward valuation of debt securities could also negatively impact the Company s capital position.  
 Stress in the commercial real estate markets, or a downturn in the residential real estate markets, could cause credit losses and deterioration in asset
values for the Company and other financial institutions. A downturn in used auto prices from its current levels could result in increased credit losses and impairment of residual lease values for the Company. Additionally, the current environment of
heightened scrutiny of financial institutions, as well as a continued focus on the pace and sustainability of the economic recovery, has resulted in increased public awareness of and sensitivity to banking fees and practices.  
 Any further deterioration in global economic conditions, including those related to recent disruptions in Europe and China, could slow the recovery of
the domestic economy or negatively impact the Company s borrowers or other counterparties that have direct or indirect exposure to these regions. Such global disruptions can undermine investor confidence, cause a contraction of available
credit, or create market volatility, any of which could have significant adverse effects on the Company s businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, even if the Company s direct exposure to the affected region is
limited. The continued depression of commodity prices, inclusive of energy prices, for an extended period of time, as well as other negative domestic market developments, may erode consumer confidence levels and cause adverse changes in payment
patterns, leading to increases in delinquencies and default rates in certain industries, or regions. Such developments could increase the Company s loan charge-offs and provision for credit losses. Any future economic deterioration that affects
household or corporate incomes and the continuing concern regarding the possibility of a return to recessionary conditions could also result in reduced demand for credit or fee-based products and services.  
  Improvements in economic indicators disproportionately affecting the financial services industry may lag improvements in the general economy  Should the moderate
recovery of the United States economy continue, the improvement of certain economic indicators, such as real estate asset values, may nevertheless continue to lag behind the overall economy, which can affect certain industries, such as real estate
and financial services, more significantly. Should real estate asset values fail to recover for an extended period of time, the Company could be adversely affected.  
  Changes in interest rates could reduce the Company s net interest income  The Company s earnings are dependent to a large degree on net interest income,
which is  

159       

the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which
in turn are affected by prevailing economic conditions, by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and by the policies of various regulatory agencies. Like all financial institutions, the Company s financial position is
affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Volatility in interest rates can also result in the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments. Direct investments, such as United States government and corporate securities and
other investment vehicles (including mutual funds) generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements.  
  Further downgrades in the U.S. government s sovereign credit rating could result in risks to the Company and general economic conditions that the Company is not
able to predict  In the past, certain ratings agencies downgraded their sovereign credit rating, or negatively revised their outlook, of the U.S. government, and have indicated that they will continue to assess fiscal projections, as well as the
medium-term economic outlook for the United States. As a result, there continues to be the perceived risk of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade of the U.S. government, including the ratings of U.S. Treasury securities. If such a downgrade were to
occur, the ratings and perceived creditworthiness of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by institutions, agencies or instrumentalities directly linked to the U.S. government could also be correspondingly affected. A downgrade might adversely
affect the market value of such instruments. Instruments of this nature are often held by financial institutions, including the Company, for investment, liquidity planning and collateral purposes. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the
U.S. government and perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government related obligations could create uncertainty in the U.S. and global financial markets and negatively impact the Company s liquidity.  
  CREDIT AND MORTGAGE BUSINESS RISK      Heightened credit risk could require
the Company to increase its provision for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition  When the Company lends money, or commits to lend money, it incurs credit risk,
or the risk of losses if its borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of the largest lenders in the United States, the credit performance of the Company s loan portfolios significantly affects its financial results and condition. The Company
incurred high levels of losses on loans during the most recent financial

crisis and recovery period, and if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of its customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations, which could result
in a higher level of credit losses and higher provisions for credit losses. The Company reserves for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance. The amount of the
Company s allowance for loan losses is based on its historical loss experience as well as an evaluation of the risks associated with its loan portfolio, including the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and
geographic concentrations within the portfolio. The stress on the United States economy and the local economies in which the Company does business may be greater or last longer than expected, resulting in, among other things, greater than expected
deterioration in credit quality of the loan portfolio, or in the value of collateral securing those loans.    In addition, the process the Company
uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their
loans. These economic predictions and their impact may no longer be capable of accurate estimation, which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process. As with any such assessments, the Company may fail to identify the proper factors or to
accurately estimate the impacts of the factors that the Company does identify. The Company also makes loans to borrowers where it does not have or service the loan with the first lien on the property securing its loan. For loans in a junior lien
position, the Company may not have access to information on the position or performance of the first lien when it is held and serviced by a third party and this may adversely affect the accuracy of the loss estimates for loans of these types.
Increases in the Company s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect its financial results. In addition, the Company s ability to
assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models and approaches it uses to select, manage, and underwrite its customers become less predictive of future behaviors.  
  A concentration of credit and market risk in the Company s loan portfolio could increase the potential for significant losses  The Company may have higher
credit risk, or experience higher credit losses, to the extent its loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. For example, the Company s credit risk and credit losses can
increase if borrowers who engage in similar activities are uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions, or by regulation, such as regulation related to climate change. Deterioration in economic conditions or real estate
values in  

160       

states or regions where the Company has relatively larger concentrations of residential or commercial real estate could result in higher credit costs. In particular, deterioration in real estate
values and underlying economic conditions in California could result in significantly higher credit losses to the Company.     Changes in interest rates can impact
the value of the Company s mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale, and can make its mortgage banking revenue volatile from quarter to quarter, which can reduce its earnings  The Company has a portfolio of MSRs, which is the
right to service a mortgage loan collect principal, interest and escrow amounts for a fee. The Company initially carries its MSRs using a fair value measurement of the present value of the estimated future net servicing income, which
includes assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus fair value. As interest rates fall, prepayments tend to increase as borrowers refinance, and the fair value of
MSRs can decrease, which in turn reduces the Company s earnings. Futher, it is possible that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall or remain low, mortgage originations
may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs  value caused by the lower rates.     A decline in
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company s results of operations  The Company s ability to engage in routine funding or settlement transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and
commercial soundness of other domestic or foreign financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different
counterparties, and the Company routinely executes and settles transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional
clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, the soundness of one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other
institutions and impact the Company s predominately United States based businesses or the less significant merchant processing, corporate trust and fund administration services businesses it operates in foreign countries. Many of these
transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company s credit risk may be further increased when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is
liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover

the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due the Company. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect the Company s results of operations.  
  Change in residual value of leased assets may have an adverse impact on the Company s financial results  The Company engages in leasing activities and is
subject to the risk that the residual value of the property under lease will be less than the Company s recorded asset value. Adverse changes in the residual value of leased assets can have a negative impact on the Company s financial
results. The risk of changes in the realized value of the leased assets compared to recorded residual values depends on many factors outside of the Company s control, including supply and demand for the assets, condition of the assets at the
end of the lease term, and other economic factors.     OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS RISK   
  A breach in the security of the Company s systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and
create significant financial and legal exposure  Although the Company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Company s computer systems,
software, networks and other technology assets, as well as its intellectual property, and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Company and its customers, the Company s security measures do not provide
absolute security. Many financial services institutions, retailers and other companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted
attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks and other means. The Company and
certain other large financial institutions in the United States have experienced several well-publicized series of apparently related attacks from technically sophisticated and well resourced third parties that were intended to disrupt normal
business activities by making internet banking systems inaccessible to customers for extended periods. These  denial-of-service  attacks have not breached the Company s data security systems, but require substantial resources to
defend, and may affect customer satisfaction and behavior. Furthermore, even if not directed at the Company, attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect, directly or
indirectly, aspects of the Company s businesses.    Third parties with which the Company does business or that facilitate its business
activities, including exchanges, clearinghouses, payment and ATM networks, financial

161       

intermediaries or vendors that provide services or technology solutions for the Company s operations, could also be sources of operational and security risks to the Company, including with
respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by their employees or cyber attacks that could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Company or result in lost or compromised information of the Company or its
customers. In addition, several large and small retailers and hospitality companies have recently disclosed substantial cyber security breaches affecting debit and credit card accounts of their customers, some of whom were the Company s
cardholders. Although these incidents have not yet had a material impact on the Company, these attacks involving Company cards are likely to continue and could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company s
financial condition or results of operations.    It is possible that the Company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive
measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently, generally increase in sophistication, often are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide
variety of sources, including organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including parties sponsored by hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or
other users of the Company s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Company s data or that of its customers or clients, such as through  phishing  schemes. These risks may increase in the future
as the Company continues to increase its mobile payments and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, the Company s customers often use their own devices, such as
computers, smart phones and tablets, to make payments and manage their accounts. The Company has limited ability to assure the safety and security of its customers  transactions with the Company to the extent they are using their own devices,
which could be subject to similar threats.    If the Company s security systems were penetrated or circumvented, or if an authorized user
intentionally or unintentionally removed, lost or destroyed operations data, it could cause serious negative consequences for the Company, including significant disruption of the Company s operations, misappropriation of confidential
information of the Company or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Company or those of its customers and counterparties. These consequences could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws; financial loss to
the Company or to its customers; loss of confidence in the Company s security measures; customer dissatisfaction; significant litigation exposure; regulatory fines, penalties or

intervention; reimbursement or other compensatory costs; additional compliance costs; and harm to the Company s reputation, all of which could adversely affect the Company.  
  The Company relies on its employees, systems and third parties to conduct its business, and certain failures could adversely affect its operations  The Company
operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. The Company incurs risks for potential losses resulting from its operations, including, but not
limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, unauthorized access to its computer systems, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of
the internal control system and compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions, fines or civil money penalties that could arise as a result of an operational
deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.  
 Third parties provide key components of the Company s business infrastructure, such as internet connections, network access and mutual fund
distribution. While the Company has selected these third parties carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problems caused by third party service providers, including as a result of their not providing the Company their services for any
reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect the Company s ability to deliver products and services to the Company s customers and otherwise to conduct its business. Replacing third party service providers could
also entail significant delay and expense. In addition, failure of third party service providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Company s ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise
to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Company s businesses to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided
by that party.    Operational risks for large institutions such as the Company have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the
proliferation of new technologies, the use of internet services and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other
external parties. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Company s possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Company could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational

162       

damage and financial loss. This mishandling or misuse could include, for example, situations in which the information is erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the
information, either by fault of the Company s systems, employees, or third party service providers, or where the information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control
system, improper operation of systems or improper employee or third party actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face legal or regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.  
  The Company could lose market share and experience increased costs if it does not effectively develop and implement new technology  The financial services industry
is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including innovative ways that customers can make payments or manage their accounts, such as through the use of digital
wallets or digital currencies. The Company s continued success depends, in part, upon its ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that customers want to adopt, and create additional efficiencies in
the Company s operations. Developing and deploying new technology-driven products and services can also involve costs that the Company may not recover and divert resources away from other product development efforts. The Company may not be able
to effectively develop and implement profitable new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the
financial services industry could harm the Company s competitive position and negatively affect its revenue and profit.     Negative publicity could damage the
Company s reputation and adversely impact its business and financial results  Reputational risk, or the risk to the Company s business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in the Company s business and
increased substantially because of the financial crisis beginning in 2008. The reputation of the financial services industry in general has been damaged as a result of the financial crisis and other matters affecting the financial services industry,
including mortgage foreclosure issues. Negative public opinion about the financial services industry generally or the Company specifically could adversely affect the Company s ability to keep and attract customers, and expose the Company to
litigation and regulatory action. Negative public opinion can result from the Company s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices, corporate governance,
executive compensation, regulatory compliance, mergers and acquisitions, and related

disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct. Because most of the
Company s businesses operate under the  U.S. Bank  brand, actual or alleged conduct by one business can result in negative public opinion about other businesses the Company operates. Although the Company takes steps to minimize
reputation risk in dealing with customers and other constituencies, the Company, as a large diversified financial services company with a high industry profile, is inherently exposed to this risk.  
  The Company s business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, by terrorist activities or by international
hostilities  Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact the Company directly (for example, by interrupting the
Company s systems, which could prevent the Company from obtaining deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling its flow of business; causing significant damage to the Company s facilities; or otherwise preventing the Company
from conducting business in the ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on the Company s borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties (for example, by damaging properties pledged as collateral
for the Company s loans or impairing the ability of certain borrowers to repay their loans). The Company could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial
markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. These types of impacts could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in the Company experiencing higher levels of nonperforming
assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.    The Company s ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of these occurrences is
in part dependent on the quality of the Company s resiliency planning, and the Company s ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of disasters, terrorist activities or international
hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that the Company transacts with, particularly those
that it depends upon, but has no control over. Additionally, the nature and level of natural disasters may be exacerbated by global climate change.

163       

LIQUIDITY RISK      If the
Company does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer  The Company s liquidity is essential for the operation of its business. Market conditions, unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could negatively affect the
Company s level or cost of funding, affecting its ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a
timely manner. If the Company s access to stable and low-cost sources of funding, such as customer deposits, are reduced, the Company might need to use alternative funding, which could be more expensive or of limited availability. Any
substantial, unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could adversely affect the Company s business.     Loss of customer deposits could
increase the Company s funding costs  The Company relies on bank deposits to be a low-cost and stable source of funding. The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If the Company s competitors
raise the rates they pay on deposits, the Company s funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises its rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding.
Higher funding costs reduce the Company s net interest margin and net interest income. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock
market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, the Company may lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing the Company s funding costs and reducing the
Company s net interest income.     A downgrade in the Company s credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, funding costs and
access to capital markets  The Company s credit ratings are important to its liquidity. A reduction in one or more of the Company s credit ratings could adversely affect its liquidity, increase its funding costs or limit its access to
the capital markets. Further, a downgrade could decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or able, contractually or otherwise, to do business or lend to the Company, thereby adversely affecting the Company s competitive
position. The Company s credit ratings and credit rating agencies  outlooks are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, which consider a number of factors, including the Company s own financial strength, performance,

prospects and operations, as well as factors not within the control of the Company, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that the
Company will maintain its current ratings and outlooks.     The Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity needs and the payment of those
dividends could be limited by laws and regulations  The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Company receives a significant portion of its cash from dividends paid by its subsidiaries. These
dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Company s stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that its bank and certain of its non-bank
subsidiaries may pay to the Company without regulatory approval. Also, the Company s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiary s
creditors, except to the extent that any of the Company s claims as a creditor of that subsidiary may be recognized.     COMPETITIVE AND STRATEGIC RISK
     The financial services industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could intensify and adversely affect the Company s financial results 
The Company operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes, as well as continued industry consolidation, which may increase in connection with
current economic and market conditions. This consolidation may produce larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. The
Company competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, investment companies, credit card companies, and a variety of other financial services
and advisory companies. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions to compete with technology
companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial solutions. Many of the Company s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures. Also, the potential need to adapt to industry changes in
information technology systems, on  

164       

which the Company and financial services industry are highly dependent, could present operational issues and require capital spending. The Company s ability to compete successfully depends
on a number of factors, including, among others, its ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives; developing, maintaining and building long-term customer relationships based on quality service, competitive prices, high ethical
standards and safe, sound assets; and industry and general economic trends. A failure to compete effectively could contribute to downward price pressure on the Company s products or services or a loss of market share.  
  The Company may need to lower prices on existing products and services and develop and introduce new products and services to maintain market share  The
Company s success depends, in part, on its ability to adapt its products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce the Company s net
interest margin and revenues from its fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services and mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablet computers, could require the Company to
make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt its existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in the Company s businesses may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure.
The Company might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services, adapting to changing customer preferences and spending and saving habits, achieving market acceptance of its products and services, or sufficiently
developing and maintaining loyal customer relationships.     The Company s business could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled employees  The
Company s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key employees. Competition for the best people in most activities the Company engages in can be intense. The Company may not be able to hire the best people or to
keep them. Recent strong scrutiny of compensation practices has resulted in, and may continue to result in, additional regulation and legislation in this area, as well as additional legislative and regulatory initiatives. There is no assurance that
this will not cause increased turnover or impede the Company s ability to retain and attract the highest caliber employees.     The Company may not be able to
complete future acquisitions, and completed acquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated, may 

result in unforeseen integration difficulties, and may dilute existing shareholders  interests  The Company regularly explores opportunities to acquire financial services businesses or
assets and may also consider opportunities to acquire other banks or financial institutions. The Company cannot predict the number, size or timing of acquisitions it might pursue.  
 The Company must generally receive federal regulatory approval before it can acquire a bank or bank holding company. The Company s ability to
pursue or complete an attractive acquisition could be negatively impacted by regulatory delay or other regulatory issues. The Company cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted.
For example, the Company may be required to sell branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval. If the Company commits certain regulatory violations, including those that result in a downgrade in certain of the Company s bank
regulatory ratings, governmental authorities could, as a consequence, preclude it from pursuing future acquisitions for a period of time.    There can
be no assurance that acquisitions the Company completes will have the anticipated positive results, including results related to expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits.
Integration efforts could divert management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the Company s operations or results. The integration could result in higher than expected customer loss, deposit attrition, loss of key
employees, disruption of the Company s businesses or the businesses of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect the Company s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of
the acquisition. Also, the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected. In addition, future acquisitions may also expose the Company to increased legal
or regulatory risks. Finally, future acquisitions could be material to the Company, and it may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders  ownership interests.  
  ACCOUNTING AND TAX RISK      The Company s reported financial results
depend on management s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates, which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future  The Company s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how the
Company records and reports its financial  

165       

condition and results of operations. The Company s management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally
accepted accounting principles and reflect management s judgment regarding the most appropriate manner to report the Company s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or
method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances, yet might result in the Company s reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.  
 Certain accounting policies are critical to presenting the Company s financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make
difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include the
allowance for credit losses, estimations of fair value, the valuation of purchased loans and related indemnification assets, the valuation of MSRs, the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty
of estimates involved in these matters, the Company may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided,
recognize significant impairment on its goodwill and other intangible asset balances, or significantly increase its accrued taxes liability. For more information, refer to  Critical Accounting Policies  in this Annual Report.  
  Changes in accounting standards could materially impact the Company s financial statements  From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company s financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the
Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. The Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently, also retroactively, in each case potentially
resulting in the Company restating prior period financial statements. As an example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued proposed guidance related to a change in the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. This
proposed guidance represents a significant departure from current accounting guidance and requires earlier recognition of credit losses in a company s financial statements as it utilizes an expected credit loss concept

rather than the incurred loss concept. This new guidance is expected to be adopted by way of a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings upon the effective date.  
  The Company s investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on the Company s
financial results  The Company invests in certain tax-advantaged projects promoting affordable housing, community development and renewable energy resources. The Company s investments in these projects are designed to generate a return
primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. The Company is subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing
authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, will fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and will not be able to be realized. The possible inability to realize these tax credit and other tax
benefits can have a negative impact on the Company s financial results. The risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside of the Company s control, including changes in the
applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed.     RISK MANAGEMENT   
  The Company s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the Company  The Company s risk management framework seeks
to mitigate risk and loss. The Company has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate
risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, reputational risk, and operational risk related to its employees, systems and vendors, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Company s risk
management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that it has not appropriately anticipated or identified. The recent financial and credit crises and resulting regulatory reform highlighted both the importance and some of the
limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and the Company s regulators remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions build and maintain robust risk management policies. If the Company s risk management framework proves
ineffective, the Company could incur litigation and negative regulatory consequences, and suffer unexpected losses that could affect its financial condition or results of operations.
