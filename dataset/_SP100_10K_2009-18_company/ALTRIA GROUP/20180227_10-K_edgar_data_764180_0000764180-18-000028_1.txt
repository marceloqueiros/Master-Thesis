Part I 
   
  Item 1.  Business. 
  General Development of Business  
     General:    Altria Group, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1985.  At December 31, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. s wholly-owned subsidiaries included Philip Morris USA Inc. ( PM USA ), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States; John Middleton Co. ( Middleton ), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA; Sherman Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries ( Nat Sherman ), which are engaged in the manufacture and sale of super premium cigarettes and the sale of premium cigars; and UST LLC ( UST ), which through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC ( USSTC ) and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. ( Ste. Michelle ), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless tobacco products and wine.  Altria Group, Inc. s other operating companies included Nu Mark LLC ( Nu Mark ), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is engaged in the manufacture and sale of innovative tobacco products, and Philip Morris Capital Corporation ( PMCC ), a wholly-owned subsidiary that maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases.  Other Altria Group, Inc. wholly-owned subsidiaries included Altria Group Distribution Company, which provides sales and distribution services to certain Altria Group, Inc. operating subsidiaries, and Altria Client Services LLC, which provides various support services in areas, such as legal, regulatory, consumer engagement, finance, human resources and external affairs to Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.   
  At September 30, 2016, Altria Group, Inc. had an approximate 27% ownership of SABMiller plc ( SABMiller ), which Altria Group, Inc. accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  In October 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV ( Legacy AB InBev ) completed its business combination with SABMiller, and Altria Group, Inc. received cash and shares representing a 9.6% ownership in the combined company (the  Transaction ).  The newly formed Belgian company, which retained the name Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV ( AB InBev ), became the holding company for the combined businesses.  Subsequently, Altria Group, Inc. purchased approximately   12 million   ordinary shares of AB InBev, increasing Altria Group, Inc. s ownership to approximately   10.2%   at December 31, 2016.  At December 31, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. had an approximate   10.2%   ownership of AB InBev, which Altria Group, Inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag.  As a result of the one-quarter lag and the timing of the completion of the Transaction,   no   earnings from Altria Group, Inc. s equity investment in AB InBev were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016.  For further discussion, see   Note 6  .   Investment in AB InBev/SABMiller   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Item 8 ). 

In January 2017, Altria Group, Inc. acquired Nat Sherman, which joined PM USA and Middleton as part of Altria Group, Inc. s smokeable products segment. 
     Source of Funds:    Because Altria Group, Inc. is a holding company, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries.  At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. receives cash dividends on its interest in AB InBev if and when AB InBev pays such dividends.       
  Financial Information About Segments    
  Altria Group, Inc. s reportable segments are smokeable products, smokeless products and wine.  The financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria Group, Inc. s innovative tobacco products businesses to Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated results.   
  Altria Group, Inc. s chief operating decision maker (the  CODM ) reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, the segments.  Operating companies income for the segments is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles.  Interest and other debt expense, net, and provision for income taxes are centrally managed at the corporate level and, accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by the CODM.  Net revenues and operating companies income (together with a reconciliation to earnings before income taxes) attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth in   Note 15  .   Segment Reporting   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (   Note 15   ).  Information about total assets by segment is not disclosed because such information is not reported to or used by the CODM.  Segment goodwill and other intangible assets, net, are disclosed in   Note 3  .   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (   Note 3   )  .    The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in   Note 2  .   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (   Note 2   )  .

  Narrative Description of Business    
  Portions of the information called for by this Item are included in   Operating Results by Business Segment   in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Item 7 ). 
  Tobacco Space 
  Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco operating companies include PM USA, USSTC and other subsidiaries of UST, Middleton, Nu Mark and Nat Sherman.  Altria Group Distribution Company provides sales and distribution services to Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco operating companies.   
  The products of Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries include smokeable tobacco products, consisting of cigarettes manufactured and sold by PM USA and Nat Sherman, machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco manufactured and sold by Middleton and premium cigars sold by Nat Sherman; smokeless tobacco products manufactured and sold by USSTC; and innovative tobacco products, including e-vapor products manufactured and sold by Nu Mark.  
     Cigarettes:      PM USA is the largest cigarette company in the United States.    Marlboro  , the principal cigarette brand of PM USA, has been the largest-selling cigarette brand in the United States for over 40 years.  Nat Sherman sells substantially all of its super premium cigarettes in the United States.  Total smokeable products segment s cigarettes shipment volume in the United States was   116.6 billion   units in   2017  , a decrease of   5.1%   from   2016  .  
     Cigars:      Middleton is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco.  Middleton contracts with a third-party importer to supply a majority of its cigars and sells substantially all of its cigars to customers in the United States.    Black   Mild   is the principal cigar brand of Middleton.  Nat Sherman sources all of its cigars from third-party suppliers and sells substantially all of its cigars to customers in the United States.  Total smokeable products segment s cigars shipment volume was approximately   1.5 billion   units in   2017  , an increase of   9.9%   from   2016  .  

Smokeless tobacco products:      USSTC is the leading producer and marketer of moist smokeless tobacco ( MST ) products.  The smokeless products segment includes the premium brands,   Copenhagen   and   Skoal  , and value brands,   Red Seal   and   Husky.    Substantially all of the smokeless tobacco products are manufactured and sold to customers in the United States.  Total smokeless products segment s shipment volume was   841.3 million   units in   2017  , a decrease of   1.4%   from   2016  . 
     Innovative tobacco products:    Nu Mark participates in the e-vapor category and has developed and commercialized other innovative tobacco products.  In addition, Nu Mark sources the production of its e-vapor products through overseas contract manufacturing arrangements.  In 2013, Nu Mark introduced   MarkTen   e-vapor products.  In April 2014, Nu Mark acquired the e-vapor business of Green Smoke, Inc. and its affiliates ( Green Smoke ), which began selling e-vapor products in 2009.  In 2017, Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries purchased certain intellectual property related to innovative tobacco products.  
  In December 2013, Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with Philip Morris International Inc. ( PMI ) pursuant to which Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries provide an exclusive license to PMI to sell Nu Mark s e-vapor products outside the United States, and PMI s subsidiaries provide an exclusive license to Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries to sell two of PMI s heated tobacco product platforms in the United States.  Further, in July 2015, Altria Group, Inc. announced the expansion of its strategic framework with PMI to include a joint research, development and technology-sharing agreement.  Under this agreement, Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries and PMI will collaborate to develop e-vapor products for commercialization in the United States by Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries and in markets outside the United States by PMI.  This agreement also provides for exclusive technology cross licenses, technical information sharing and cooperation on scientific assessment, regulatory engagement and approval related to e-vapor products. 
  In the fourth quarter of 2016, PMI submitted a Modified Risk Tobacco Product ( MRTP ) application for an electronically heated tobacco product with the United States Food and Drug Administration s ( FDA ) Center for Tobacco Products and filed its corresponding pre-market tobacco product application in the first quarter of 2017.  Upon regulatory authorization by the FDA, Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries will have an exclusive license to sell this heated tobacco product in the United States.    
     Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials:      Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers (including distributors), large retail organizations, including chain stores, and the armed services. 
    The market for tobacco products is highly competitive, characterized by brand recognition and loyalty, with product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition.  Promotional activities include, in certain instances and where permitted by law, allowances, the distribution of incentive items, price promotions, product promotions, coupons and other discounts.

     Table of Contents  

In June 2009, the President of the United States of America signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ( FSPTCA ), which provides the FDA with broad authority to regulate the design, manufacture, packaging, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products; the authority to require disclosures of related information; and the authority to enforce the FSPTCA and related regulations.  The FSPTCA went into effect in 2009 for cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in August 2016 for all other tobacco products, including cigars, e-vapor products, pipe tobacco and oral tobacco-derived nicotine products ( Other Tobacco Products ).  The FSPTCA imposes restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products, including at retail.  PM USA, Middleton, Nat Sherman and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees as a result of the FSPTCA.  Their respective FDA user fee amounts are determined by an allocation formula administered by the FDA that is based on the respective market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product.  PM USA, Nat Sherman, USSTC and other U.S. tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the United States as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions. 
  In the United States, under a contract growing program, PM USA purchases the majority of its burley and flue-cured leaf tobaccos directly from tobacco growers.  Under the terms of this program, PM USA agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts.  PM USA also purchases a portion of its tobacco requirements through leaf merchants.   
  Nat Sherman purchases its tobacco requirements through leaf merchants. 
  USSTC purchases dark fire-cured, dark air-cured and burley leaf tobaccos from domestic tobacco growers under a contract growing program as well as from leaf merchants.   
  Middleton purchases burley, dark air-cured and flue-cured leaf tobaccos through leaf merchants.  Middleton does not have a contract growing program. 
  Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements.  See Item 1A.  Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Item 1A ) and   Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Price, Availability and Quality of Agricultural Products   in Item 7 for a discussion of risks associated with tobacco supply.  
  Wine 
  Ste. Michelle is a producer and supplier of premium varietal and blended table wines and of sparkling wines.  Ste. Michelle is a leading producer of Washington state wines, primarily   Chateau Ste. Michelle  ,   Columbia Crest   and   14 Hands  ,     and owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other domestic and foreign wine     regions.  Ste. Michelle s total   2017   wine shipment volume of approximately   8.5 million   cases decreased   8.6%   from   2016  .   
  Ste. Michelle     holds an 85% ownership interest in Michelle-Antinori, LLC, which owns   Stag s Leap Wine Cellars   in Napa Valley.  Ste. Michelle also owns   Conn Creek   in Napa Valley,   Patz   Hall   in Sonoma and   Erath   in Oregon.  In addition, Ste.  

Michelle imports and markets   Antinori  ,   Torres   and   Villa Maria Estate   wines and   Champagne Nicolas Feuillatte   in the United States.   
     Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials:      Key elements of Ste. Michelle s strategy are expanded domestic distribution of its wines, especially in certain account categories such as restaurants, wholesale clubs, supermarkets, wine shops and mass merchandisers, and a focus on improving product mix to higher-priced, premium products.  
  Ste. Michelle s business is subject to significant competition, including competition from many larger, well-established domestic and international companies, as well as from many smaller wine producers.  Wine segment competition is primarily based on quality, price, consumer and trade wine tastings, competitive wine judging, third-party acclaim and advertising.  Substantially all of Ste. Michelle s sales occur in the United States through state-licensed distributors.  Ste. Michelle also sells to domestic consumers through retail and e-commerce channels and exports wines to international distributors. 
  Federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the beverage alcohol industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing rules, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies.  Further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on Ste. Michelle s wine business. 
  Ste. Michelle uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards or purchased from independent growers, as well as bulk wine purchased from other sources.  Grape production can be adversely affected by weather and other forces that may limit production.  At the present time, Ste. Michelle believes that there is a sufficient supply of grapes and bulk wine available in the market to satisfy its current and expected production requirements.  See Item 1A for a discussion of risks associated with competition, unfavorable changes in grape supply and governmental regulations.  
  Financial Services Business 
  In 2003, PMCC ceased making new investments and began focusing exclusively on managing its portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize its operating results and cash flows from its existing lease portfolio activities and asset sales.  For further information on PMCC s finance assets, see   Note 7  .   Finance Assets, net   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.  
  Other Matters 
     Customers:      The largest customer of PM USA, USSTC, Middleton and Nat Sherman, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately   26%  ,   25%   and   26%   of Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated net revenues for the years ended   December 31, 2017  , 2016 and 2015, respectively.  In addition, Core-Mark Holding Company, Inc. accounted for approximately   14%  ,   14%   and   10%   of Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Substantially all of these net revenues were reported in the smokeable products and smokeless products segments.

     Employees:    At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries employed approximately   8,300   people.  
     Executive Officers of Altria Group, Inc.:    The disclosure regarding executive officers is included in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance -   Executive Officers as of February 13, 2018   of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
     Research and Development:    Research and development expense for the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015   is set forth in   Note 17  .   Additional Information   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.  
     Intellectual Property:    Trademarks are of material importance to Altria Group, Inc. and its operating companies, and are protected by registration or otherwise.  In addition, as of   December 31, 2017  , the portfolio of approximately 800 United States patents owned by Altria Group, Inc. s businesses, as a whole, was material to Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco businesses.  However, no one patent or group of related patents was material to Altria Group, Inc. s business or its tobacco businesses as of   December 31, 2017  .  Altria Group, Inc. s businesses also have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are protected by appropriate confidentiality measures.  Certain trade secrets are material to Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco and wine businesses. 
     Environmental Regulation:      Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States:  The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as  Superfund ), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party.  Subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) of Altria Group, Inc. are involved in several matters subjecting them to potential costs of remediation and natural resource damages under Superfund or other laws and regulations.  Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations.  As discussed in   Note 2  ,   Altria Group, Inc. provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.  Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. may undertake in the future.  In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation and compliance costs or damages and the making of  

related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.

  Item 1A.  Risk Factors. 
  The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our results of operations, our cash flows, our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  We    (1)    may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the SEC, reports to security 
  _____________________________________________________ 
   (1)    This section uses the terms  we,   our  and  us  when it is not necessary to distinguish among Altria Group, Inc. and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context.

holders, press releases and investor webcasts.  You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as  strategy,   expects,   continues,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   will,   estimates,   forecasts,   intends,   projects,   goals,   objectives,   guidance,   targets  and other words of similar meaning.  You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. 
  We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans, estimates and assumptions.  Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate.  Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected.  You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in Altria Group, Inc. s securities. In connection with the  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements.  We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in the  Business Environment  sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries  businesses below in Item 7.  You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors.  Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.  We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law. 
  Unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc., or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries.    
  Legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including PM USA and UST and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees.  Various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, tax, contraband-related claims, patent infringement, employment matters, claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors.  
  Litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases.  An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.  Damages claimed in some tobacco-related or other litigation are significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions of dollars.  The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may  

be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome.  In certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants  liability is joint and several.  In such cases, Altria Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment.  As a result, Altria Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts. Furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, Altria Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys  fees. 
  Although PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases.  This risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and Puerto Rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all.  As discussed in   Note 18  .   Contingencies   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (   Note 18   ), tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well.  Such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court.  Although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc., or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.  
  In certain litigation, Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries may face potentially significant non-monetary remedies, which may cause reputational harm.  For example, in the lawsuit brought by the United States Department of Justice, discussed in detail in   Note 18  , the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant non-monetary remedies, including the issuance of  corrective statements  that Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA began making in various media in the fourth quarter of 2017.   
  Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation.  Nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty, and significant challenges remain. 
  It is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc., or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation.  Altria Group, Inc. and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts.  Each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges.  However, Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries may enter into  

5 

     Table of Contents  

settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of Altria Group, Inc. to do so.  See Item 3.   Legal Proceedings   of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Item 3 ),   Note 18   and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of pending tobacco-related litigation.  
  Significant federal, state and local governmental actions, including actions by the FDA, and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on our tobacco subsidiaries  businesses and sales volumes. 
  As described in   Tobacco Space - Business Environment   in Item 7, our cigarette subsidiaries face significant governmental and private sector actions, including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold these subsidiaries responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.  These actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume, and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels.  
  Actions by the FDA and other federal, state or local governments or agencies, including those specific actions described in   Tobacco Space - Business Environment   in Item 7  ,   may impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products (for example, through product standards), limit adult tobacco consumer choices, delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk, require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace (for example as a result of product contamination, a determination by the FDA that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence, or because the FDA requires that a modification to a currently-marketed tobacco product proceed through the pre-market review process), restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers, restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products, create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies, impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packing requirements, interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business, or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments.  Any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.  See   Tobacco Space - Business Environment   in Item 7     for a more detailed discussion. 
  Tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation, which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries.  
  Tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes, and significant increases in tobacco product-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the United States at the state, federal and local levels. Tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco  

subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments or to other low-priced or low-taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. Such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries. For further discussion, see   Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Excise Taxes   in Item 7  . 
  Our tobacco businesses face significant competition within their categories and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of Altria Group, Inc., or the business of Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries. 
  Each of Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories.   Significant methods of competition include product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging, distribution and promotional activities.  A highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability, market share and shipment volume of our tobacco subsidiaries, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of Altria Group, Inc. 
  PM USA also faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain United States and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the United States.  These settlements, among other factors, have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases.  These manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers  cigarettes sold in such states.  Additional competition has resulted from diversion into the United States market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the United States, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes, and imports of foreign lowest priced brands.  USSTC faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer down-trading to lower-priced brands.  In the cigar category, additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machine-made large cigars manufactured offshore. 
  Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences, responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions. 
  Each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences.  To be successful, they must continue to: 
             
    promote brand equity successfully; 

6 

     Table of Contents  

anticipate and respond to new and evolving adult consumer preferences; 
                
    develop, manufacture, market and distribute products that appeal to adult consumers (including, where appropriate, through arrangements with, or investments in, third parties); 
                
    improve productivity; and 
                
    protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases. 
     See   Tobacco Space - Business Environment   -   Summary   in Item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, including e-vapor products.  Growth of this product category could contribute to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and could adversely affect the growth rates of other tobacco products. 
  The willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions.  In periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may purchase more discount brands and/or, in the case of tobacco products, consider lower-priced tobacco products, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  While our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lower-priced products, the failure to do so could negatively impact our companies  ability to compete in these circumstances.  
  Our financial services business (conducted through PMCC) holds investments in finance leases, principally in transportation (including aircraft), power generation, real estate and manufacturing equipment.  Its lessees are subject to significant competition and uncertain economic conditions.  If parties to PMCC s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions, PMCC may have to increase its allowance for losses, which would adversely affect our earnings. 
  Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing adjacent products or processes, including innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers, which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams and/or put them at a competitive disadvantage. 
  Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into adjacent products or processes, including innovative tobacco products.  Some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products, while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers (within and outside the United States) products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences. Examples include tobacco-containing and nicotine-containing products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke and/or constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful. These efforts may include arrangements with, or  

investments in, third parties.  Our tobacco subsidiaries may not succeed in their efforts to introduce such new products, which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams. 
  Further, we cannot predict whether regulators, including the FDA, will permit the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk to adult consumers, the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products.  Nor can we predict whether adult tobacco consumers  purchasing decisions would be affected by reduced risk claims if permitted.  Adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products. 
  If our tobacco subsidiaries do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk, but one or more of their competitors do succeed, our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage.  
  Significant changes in tobacco leaf price, availability or quality could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries. 
  Any significant change in tobacco leaf prices, quality or availability could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries  profitability and business.  For further discussion, see   Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Price, Availability and Quality     of Agricultural Products   in Item 7  . 
  Because Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers, an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries. 
  Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers.  A natural or man-made disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries or the operations of any key suppliers of any of Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries, including as a result of a key supplier s unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company, could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries.  An extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries or key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries. 
  Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries could decide or be required to recall products, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

7 

     Table of Contents  

In addition to a recall required by the FDA, as referenced above, our subsidiaries could decide, or laws or regulations could require them, to recall products due to the failure to meet quality standards or specifications, suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination, or other adulteration, product misbranding or product tampering.  In January 2017, USSTC announced that it was voluntarily recalling certain of its smokeless tobacco products manufactured at a USSTC facility due to product tampering.  USSTC recorded a charge during the first quarter of 2017 related to this recall.  While this charge was not material to Altria Group, Inc. s financial statements, future recalls (if any) could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
  Altria Group, Inc. may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions. 
  Our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions.  The tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance.  As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent. 
  Acquisitions or other events may adversely affect Altria Group, Inc. s credit rating, and Altria Group, Inc. may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction. 
  From time to time, Altria Group, Inc. considers acquisitions and may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement.  Although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time, it is possible that completing a given acquisition or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings.  Any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.   
  Furthermore, acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition. 
  Disruption and uncertainty in the debt capital markets could adversely affect Altria Group, Inc. s access to the debt capital markets, earnings and dividend rate. 
  Access to the debt capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs.  Disruption and uncertainty in the credit and debt capital markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability, pricing, credit terms or credit rating  

may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate. 
  Altria Group, Inc. may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which would reduce earnings. 
  We periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment.  This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions, regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences, success of planned new product introductions, competitive activity and tobacco-related taxes.  Certain events can also trigger an immediate review of intangible assets.  If an impairment is determined to exist in either situation, we will incur impairment losses, which will reduce our earnings.  
  Competition, unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect Ste. Michelle s wine business. 
  Ste. Michelle s business is subject to significant competition, including from many large, well-established domestic and international companies.  The adequacy of Ste. Michelle s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industry-wide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions, particularly in eastern Washington.  Supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices, which ultimately may have a negative impact on Ste. Michelle s sales.  In addition, federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies.  New regulations or revisions to existing regulations, resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, may have an adverse effect on Ste. Michelle s wine business.  For further discussion, see   Wine Segment - Business Environment   in Item 7. 
  The failure of Altria Group, Inc. s information systems or service providers  information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
  Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries rely extensively on information systems, many of which are managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax requirements; engaging in marketing and e-commerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating internally and externally with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers,  

8 

     Table of Contents  

adult consumers and others.  We continue to make investments in administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyber-threats, including human error and malicious acts.  Our safeguards include employee training, testing and auditing protocols, backup systems and business continuity plans, maintenance of security policies and procedures, monitoring of networks and systems, and third-party risk management.  
  To date, interruptions of our information systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations.  However, because technology is increasingly complex and cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. Failure of our systems or service providers  systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could result in loss of revenue, assets, personal data, intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data, violation of applicable privacy and data security laws, damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands, operational disruptions, legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
  Unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
  From time to time, Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.  We cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of any such investigation, and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of a future investigation.   
  Expanding international business operations subjects Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs. 
  While Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the United States, they do engage (directly or indirectly) in certain international business activities that are subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption.  Although we have a Code of Conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law, no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees or third parties.  Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs. 
  Altria Group, Inc. s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in AB InBev and the dividends paid by AB InBev on shares owned by Altria Group, Inc. may be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. 

For purposes of financial reporting, the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in AB InBev are translated into U.S. dollars from various local currencies.  In addition, AB InBev pays dividends in euros, which we convert into U.S. dollars.  During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar against these currencies, our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in AB InBev will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars and the dividends that we receive from AB InBev will convert into fewer U.S. dollars.   
  Dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in AB InBev are also subject to the risks encountered by AB InBev in its business.  We cannot provide any assurance that AB InBev will successfully execute its business plans and strategies.  Earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in AB InBev are also subject to fluctuations in AB InBev s stock price, for example through mark-to-market losses on AB InBev s derivative financial instruments used to hedge certain share commitments. 
  We received a substantial portion of our consideration from the Transaction in the form of restricted shares subject to a five-year lock-up.  Furthermore, if our percentage ownership in AB InBev were to decrease below certain levels, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, suffer a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the AB InBev Board of Directors and be unable to account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. 
  Upon completion of the Transaction, we received a substantial portion of our consideration in the form of restricted shares that cannot be sold or transferred for a period of five years following the Transaction, subject to limited exceptions.  These transfer restrictions will require us to bear the risks associated with our investment in AB InBev for a five-year period that expires on October 10, 2021.  Further, in the event that our ownership percentage in AB InBev were to decrease below certain levels, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the AB InBev Board of Directors could be reduced from two to one or zero and our use of the equity method of accounting for our investment in AB InBev could be challenged.  
  Our tax treatment of the Transaction consideration may be challenged and the tax treatment of AB InBev dividends may not be as favorable as Altria Group, Inc. anticipates. 
  While we expect the equity consideration that we received from the Transaction to qualify for tax-deferred treatment, we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and, if they do, what the outcome of any such challenge will be.  In addition, there is a risk that the tax treatment of the dividends Altria Group, Inc. expects to receive from AB InBev may not be as favorable as Altria Group, Inc. anticipates.

Item 2.  Properties. 
  In 2017, Altria Client Services LLC purchased the previously leased property in Richmond, Virginia that serves as the headquarters facility for Altria Group, Inc., PM USA, USSTC, Middleton, Nu Mark and certain other subsidiaries. 
  At December 31, 2017, PM USA owned and operated a manufacturing site located in Richmond, Virginia ( Richmond Manufacturing Center ), that PM USA uses in the manufacturing of cigarettes.  Portions of this facility are leased by Middleton and USSTC for use in the manufacturing of cigars and smokeless tobacco products, respectively.   
    At   December 31, 2017  , the smokeable products segment used five manufacturing and processing facilities, including the Richmond Manufacturing Center.  In addition to the Richmond Manufacturing Center, PM USA owns and operates a cigarette tobacco processing facility located in the Richmond, Virginia area.  Nat Sherman owns and operates a cigarette manufacturing facility in Greensboro, North Carolina.  Middleton, in addition to the Richmond Manufacturing Center, operates two manufacturing and processing facilities - one, which it owns, in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and one, which it leases, in Limerick, Pennsylvania, that are used in the manufacturing and processing of cigars and pipe tobacco.  In addition, PM USA owns a research and technology center in Richmond, Virginia that is leased to an affiliate, Altria Client Services LLC.   
  At   December 31, 2017  , in addition to the Richmond Manufacturing Center, the smokeless products segment used five smokeless tobacco manufacturing and processing facilities located in Clarksville, Tennessee; Franklin Park, Illinois; Nashville, Tennessee; and two facilities in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, all of which are owned and operated by USSTC, with the exception of the facility leased by USSTC in Franklin Park, Illinois. 
  As disclosed in Note 4.   Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ( Note 4 ), in October 2016, Altria Group, Inc. announced the consolidation of certain of its operating companies  manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies.  Middleton is in the process of transferring its Limerick, Pennsylvania operations to the Richmond Manufacturing Center.  USSTC is in the process of transferring its Franklin Park, Illinois operations to its Nashville, Tennessee facility and the Richmond Manufacturing Center.  The consolidation is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018. 
  At   December 31, 2017  , the wine segment used 12 wine-making facilities - seven in Washington, four in California and one in Oregon.  All of these facilities are owned and operated by Ste. Michelle, with the exception of a facility that is leased by Ste. Michelle in Washington.  In addition, in order to support the production of its wines, the wine segment used vineyards in Washington, California and Oregon that are leased or owned by Ste. Michelle.  
  The plants and properties owned or leased and operated by Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries are maintained in good  

condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for present needs.

Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
    The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, and the discussion of cautionary factors that may affect future results in Item 1A.  
  Description of the Company 
  At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. s wholly-owned subsidiaries included PM USA, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States; Middleton, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA; Nat Sherman, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of super premium cigarettes and the sale of premium cigars; and UST, which through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including USSTC and Ste. Michelle, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless tobacco products and wine.  Altria Group, Inc. s other operating companies included Nu Mark, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is engaged in the manufacture and sale of innovative tobacco products, and PMCC, a wholly-owned subsidiary that maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases.  Other Altria Group, Inc. wholly-owned subsidiaries included Altria Group Distribution Company, which provides sales and distribution services to certain Altria Group, Inc. operating subsidiaries, and Altria Client Services LLC, which provides various support services in areas, such as legal, regulatory, consumer engagement, finance, human resources and external affairs to Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  In addition, Nu Mark, Middleton and Nat Sherman use third-party arrangements in the manufacture of their products.  Altria Group, Inc. s access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries.  At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.   
  At September 30, 2016, Altria Group, Inc. had an approximate   27%   ownership of SABMiller, which Altria Group, Inc. accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  In October 2016, Legacy AB InBev completed the Transaction, and AB InBev became the holding company for the combined SABMiller and Legacy AB InBev businesses.  Upon completion of the Transaction, Altria Group, Inc. had a   9.6%   ownership of AB InBev based on AB InBev s shares outstanding.  Subsequently, Altria Group, Inc. purchased approximately   12 million   ordinary shares of AB InBev, increasing Altria Group, Inc. s ownership to approximately   10.2%   at December 31, 2016.  At December 31, 2017, Altria  

Group, Inc. had an approximate   10.2%   ownership of AB InBev, which Altria Group, Inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag.  As a result of the one-quarter lag and the timing of the completion of the Transaction, no earnings from Altria Group, Inc. s equity investment in AB InBev were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Altria Group, Inc. receives cash dividends on its interest in AB InBev if and when AB InBev pays such dividends.  For further discussion, see   Note 6  .   Investment in AB InBev/SABMiller   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (   Note 6   ). 
  Altria Group, Inc. s reportable segments are smokeable products, smokeless products and wine.  The financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria Group, Inc. s innovative tobacco products businesses to Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated results. 
  In January 2017, Altria Group, Inc. acquired Nat Sherman, which joined PM USA and Middleton as part of Altria Group, Inc. s smokeable products segment.

Executive Summary 
  The following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the Discussion and Analysis that follows. 
  Consolidated Results of Operations  
  The changes in Altria Group, Inc. s net earnings and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) attributable to Altria Group, Inc. for the year ended   December 31, 2017  , from the year ended   December 31, 2016  , were due primarily to the following: 

See the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the Consolidated Operating Results section of the following Discussion and Analysis.  
             
    Fewer Shares Outstanding:    Fewer shares outstanding during 2017 compared with 2016 were due primarily to shares repurchased by Altria Group, Inc. under its share repurchase program. 
                
    Change in Tax Rate:    The change in tax rate was driven primarily by no tax being due on the dividends Altria Group, Inc. received from AB InBev during 2017 as a result of a deemed repatriation tax associated with the Tax Reform Act (as defined below).  For further discussion, see   Note 14  .   Income Taxes   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (   Note 14   ). 

Operations:    The increase of   $474 million   in operations shown in the table above was due primarily to higher income from the smokeable products and smokeless products segments. 
     For further details, see the Consolidated Operating Results and Operating Results by Business Segment sections of the following Discussion and Analysis. 
  2018 Forecasted Results 
  In February 2018, Altria Group, Inc. forecasted that its 2018 full-year adjusted diluted EPS growth rate is expected to be in the range of 15% to 19% over 2017 full-year adjusted diluted EPS.  This forecasted growth rate excludes the income and expense items in the table below.  Altria Group, Inc. s 2018 guidance reflects investments in focus areas for long-term growth, including innovative product development and launches, regulatory science, brand equity, retail fixtures and future retail concepts.  Altria Group, Inc. expects its 2018 full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of approximately 23% to 24%. 
  Altria Group, Inc. s full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance and full-year forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations.  These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, gain on the Transaction, AB InBev/SABMiller special items, certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer  ( NPM ) adjustment disputes under the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (such dispute resolutions are referred to as  NPM Adjustment Items  and are more fully described in   Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes   in   Note 18  ). 
  Altria Group, Inc. s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph, on Altria Group, Inc. s reported diluted EPS and reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, may be infrequent, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable.  As a result, Altria Group, Inc. does not provide a corresponding United States generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted EPS guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast.   
  In addition, the factors described in Item 1A represent continuing risks to this forecast.

Expense (Income), Net Excluded from Adjusted Diluted EPS 

(1)    Represents tax expense for a tax basis adjustment related to the deemed repatriation tax associated with the Tax Reform Act (as defined below).  For further discussion, see Note 14.   
  Altria Group, Inc. reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Altria Group, Inc. s management reviews certain financial results, including diluted EPS, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items, including those items noted above.  Altria Group, Inc. s management does not view any of these special items to be part of Altria Group, Inc. s underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results.  Altria Group, Inc. s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis.  Altria Group, Inc. s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate.  Altria Group, Inc. s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results.  Adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to the CODM for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets.  These adjusted financial measures are not consistent with U.S. GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.  These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   
  Discussion and Analysis 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Note 2   includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated financial statements.  In most instances, Altria Group, Inc. must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under U.S. GAAP. 
  The preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts  

of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.  Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between Altria Group, Inc. s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated financial statements: 
     Consolidation:    The consolidated financial statements include Altria Group, Inc., as well as its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries.  Investments in which Altria Group, Inc. has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
     Revenue Recognition:    Altria Group, Inc. s businesses recognize revenues, net of sales incentives and sales returns, and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers.  Payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized.  Altria Group, Inc. s businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues.  Shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. 
     Depreciation, Amortization, Impairment Testing and Asset Valuation:    Altria Group, Inc. depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes its definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years. 
  Altria Group, Inc. reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  Altria Group, Inc. performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.  These analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates.  For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Altria Group, Inc. groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.  If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.  Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.  Altria Group, Inc. also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.

     Table of Contents  

Substantially all of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded by Altria Group, Inc. at   December 31, 2017   relate to the acquisitions of Nat Sherman in 2017, Green Smoke in 2014, UST in 2009 and Middleton in 2007.  Altria Group, Inc. conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require Altria Group, Inc. to perform an interim review.  If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired.  The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value.  If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value.  For substantially all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values are determined using discounted cash flows. 
  Goodwill by reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets at   December 31, 2017   were as follows: 

During   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , Altria Group, Inc. completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and no impairment charges resulted.  At December 31, 2017, the estimated fair values of all reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets within those reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values, except for the   Columbia Crest   trademark within the wine reporting unit.  At December 31, 2017, the fair value of the   Columbia Crest   trademark exceeded its book value of $54 million by approximately 9%.  Results for   Columbia Crest   in 2017 were negatively impacted by increased competitive activity and continued trade inventory reductions.   
  In 2017, Altria Group, Inc. used an income approach to estimate the fair values of substantially all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  The income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows.  The weighted-average discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 9%. 
  In performing the 2017 discounted cash flow analysis, Altria Group, Inc. made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were volume, income, growth rates and discount rates.  The analysis incorporated assumptions used in Altria Group, Inc. s long-term financial forecast, which is used by Altria Group, Inc. s  

management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets.  The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of Altria Group, Inc. s indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast.  The perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2%.  Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of Altria Group, Inc. s control. 
  Although Altria Group, Inc. s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed, there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows.  The following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and, therefore, Altria Group, Inc. s impairment conclusions:  general economic conditions; federal, state and local regulatory developments; category growth rates; consumer preferences; success of planned product expansions; competitive activity; and income and tobacco-related taxes.  For further discussion of these factors, see   Operating Results by Business Segment   -   Tobacco Space   -   Business Environment   below. 
  While Altria Group, Inc. s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are reasonable, actual performance in the short-term or long-term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods. 
  For additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see   Note 3  . 
     Marketing Costs:    Altria Group, Inc. s businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs, consumer incentives and trade promotions.  Such programs include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, event marketing and volume-based incentives.  Consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred.  Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues, a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period, based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates.  For interim reporting purposes, consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year. 
     Contingencies:    As discussed in   Note 18   and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including PM USA and UST and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees.  In 1998, PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers entered into the 1998 Master Settlement  

17 

     Table of Contents  

Agreement (the  MSA ) with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims.  PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, the  State Settlement Agreements ).  PM USA s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers  domestic cigarette shipments, including roll-your-own cigarettes, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due.  In addition, PM USA, Middleton, Nat Sherman and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA.  Payments under the State Settlement Agreements and the FDA user fees are based on variable factors, such as volume, operating income, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment.  Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries account for the cost of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees as a component of cost of sales.  Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries recorded approximately $4.7 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees. 
  Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed in   Note 18   and Item 3: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.  Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.   
     Employee Benefit Plans:    As discussed in   Note 16  .   Benefit Plans   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (   Note 16   ), Altria Group, Inc. provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits.  Altria Group, Inc. records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.  Altria Group, Inc. reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so.  Any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.   

Altria Group, Inc. recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years.    
  At December 31, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans obligations decreased from 4.1% to 3.7% at December 31, 2017.  Altria Group, Inc. presently anticipates an increase of approximately $30 million in its 2018 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense versus 2017, excluding amounts in each year related to termination, settlement and curtailment.  This anticipated increase is due primarily to higher amortization of unrecognized losses, driven by the impact of lower discount rates, partially offset by the expected return on postretirement assets resulting from the December 2017 $270 million contribution to fund certain postretirement benefits.  Assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve, a 50 basis point decrease in Altria Group, Inc. s discount rates would increase Altria Group, Inc. s pension and postretirement expense by approximately $53 million, and a 50 basis point increase in Altria Group, Inc. s discount rates would decrease Altria Group, Inc. s pension and postretirement expense by approximately $49 million.  Similarly, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) Altria Group, Inc. s pension and postretirement expense by approximately $38 million.  See   Note 16   for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates. 
     Income Taxes:    Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.  Altria Group, Inc. s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Altria Group, Inc. records a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.   
  Altria Group, Inc. recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.  The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  Altria Group, Inc. recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings. 
  Altria Group, Inc. recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   as a result of various tax events, including the impact of the Tax Reform Act (as defined below). 

18 

     Table of Contents  

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Tax Reform Act ).  The main provisions of the Tax Reform Act that impact Altria Group, Inc. include: (i) a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from   35%   to   21%   effective January 1, 2018, and (ii) changes in the treatment of foreign-source income, commonly referred to as a modified territorial tax system.  
  The transition to a modified territorial tax system required Altria Group, Inc. to record a deemed repatriation tax and an associated tax basis benefit in 2017.  The tax impact related to the tax basis benefit and the deemed repatriation tax was based on provisional estimates as of January 18, 2018, substantially all of which were related to Altria Group, Inc. s share of AB InBev s accumulated earnings and associated taxes.  Altria Group, Inc. may be required to adjust these provisional estimates based on (i) additional guidance related to, or interpretation of, the Tax Reform Act and associated tax laws and (ii) additional information to be received from AB InBev, including information regarding AB InBev s accumulated earnings and associated taxes for the 2016 and 2017 tax years.  This additional guidance and information could result in increases or decreases to the provisional estimates, which may be significant in relation to these estimates.  Altria Group, Inc. will record any such adjustments in 2018. 
  For additional information on income taxes, see   Note 14  . 
    
  Consolidated Operating Results   

As discussed further in   Note 15  , the CODM reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, the segments.  Operating companies income for the segments is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles.  Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of the various business segments. 
  The following events that occurred during   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   affected the comparability of statement of earnings amounts.  
     Gain on AB InBev/SABMiller Business Combination:    For the year ended December 31, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. recorded pre-tax gains of   $445 million   related to the planned completion of the remaining AB InBev divestitures of certain SABMiller assets and businesses in connection with Legacy AB InBev obtaining necessary regulatory clearances for the Transaction.  As a result of the Transaction, for the year ended December 31, 2016, Altria Group, Inc. recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately   $13.9 billion  .  For further discussion, see   Note 6  .  
     NPM Adjustment Items:        For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, pre-tax expense (income) for NPM Adjustment Items was recorded in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statements of earnings as follows: 

The amounts shown in the table above for the smokeable products segment were recorded by PM USA as increases (reductions) to costs of sales, which decreased (increased) operating companies income in the smokeable products segment.  For further discussion, see   Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes   in   Note 18  . 
     Tobacco and Health Litigation Items:    For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, pre-tax charges related to certain tobacco and health litigations items were recorded in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statements of earnings as follows: 

During 2017, PM USA recorded pre-tax charges of   $72 million   in marketing, administration and research costs and   $8 million   in interest costs, substantially all of which related to 11   Engle   progeny cases.  
  During 2016, PM USA recorded pre-tax charges of $88 million in marketing, administration and research costs, primarily

related to settlements in the   Miner   and   Aspinall   cases totaling approximately   $67 million   and   $16 million   related to a judgment in the   Merino   case.  In addition, during 2016, PM USA recorded   $17 million   in interest costs primarily related to   Aspinall  .  
  During 2015, PM USA recorded pre-tax charges in marketing, administration and research costs in   seven   state   Engle   progeny cases and   Schwarz   of   $59 million   and   $25 million  , respectively, as well as   $14 million   and $9 million, respectively, in interest costs related to these cases.  Additionally in 2015, PM USA and certain other cigarette manufacturers reached an agreement to resolve approximately   415   pending federal   Engle   progeny cases.  As a result of the agreement, PM USA recorded a pre-tax provision of approximately   $43 million   in marketing, administration and research costs.   
  For further discussion, see   Note 18  . 
     Settlement for Lump Sum Pension Payments  :  In the third quarter of 2017, Altria Group, Inc. made a voluntary, limited-time offer to former employees with vested benefits in the Altria Retirement Plan who had not commenced receiving benefit payments and who met certain other conditions.  Eligible participants were offered the opportunity to make a one-time election to receive their pension benefit as a single lump sum payment or as a monthly annuity.  As a result of the 2017 lump sum distributions, a one-time pre-tax settlement charge of $81 million was recorded in 2017 in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statement of earnings as follows: 

For further discussion, see   Note 16  . 
     Asset Impairment, Exit, Implementation, Integration and Acquisition-Related Costs:    Pre-tax asset impairment, exit, implementation, integration and acquisition-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $89 million, $206 million and $11 million, respectively. 
  In October 2016, Altria Group, Inc. announced the consolidation of certain of its operating companies  manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies.  The consolidation is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and deliver approximately   $50 million   in annualized cost savings by the end of 2018. 
  As a result of the consolidation, Altria Group, Inc. expects to record total pre-tax charges of approximately   $150 million  , or   $0.05   per share.  Of this amount, during 2017, Altria Group, Inc.  

recorded pre-tax charges of $78 million and, in 2016, recorded   $71 million  . 
  In January 2016, Altria Group, Inc. announced a productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating companies  leadership and cost competitiveness.  The initiative, which reduces spending on certain selling, general and administrative infrastructure and implements a leaner organizational structure, delivered Altria Group, Inc. s goal of approximately $300 million in annualized productivity savings as of December 31, 2017.  As a result of the initiative, during 2016, Altria Group, Inc. incurred total pre-tax restructuring charges of   $132 million  .  Total pre-tax charges related to the initiative have been completed. 
  For further discussion on asset impairment, exit and implementation costs, including a breakdown of these costs by segment, see   Note 4  .  
     Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt:    During 2016 and 2015, Altria Group, Inc. completed debt tender offers to purchase for cash certain of its senior unsecured notes in aggregate principal amounts of   $0.9 billion   and   $0.8 billion  , respectively.   
  As a result of these debt tender offers, pre-tax losses on early extinguishment of debt were recorded as follows: 

For further discussion, see   Note 9  .   Long-Term Debt   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (   Note 9   ). 
     AB InBev/SABMiller Special Items:    Altria Group, Inc. s earnings from its equity investment in AB InBev for 2017 included net pre-tax charges of $160 million, consisting primarily of Altria Group, Inc. s share of AB InBev s Brazilian tax item and Altria Group, Inc. s share of AB InBev s mark-to-market losses on AB InBev s derivative financial instruments used to hedge certain share commitments.  Altria Group, Inc. s earnings from its equity investment in SABMiller for 2016 included net pre-tax income of $89 million, due primarily to a pre-tax non-cash gain of $309 million, reflecting Altria Group, Inc. s share of SABMiller s increase to shareholders  equity, resulting from the completion of the SABMiller, The Coca-Cola Company and Gutsche Family Investments transaction, combining bottling operations in Africa, partially offset by Altria Group, Inc. s share of SABMiller s costs related to the Transaction and asset impairment charges.  Altria Group, Inc. s earnings from its equity investment in SABMiller for 2015 included net pre-tax charges of $126 million, consisting primarily of Altria Group, Inc. s share of SABMiller s asset impairment charges. 
     Tax Items:    Tax items for 2017 included net tax benefits of $3,367 million related to the Tax Reform Act recorded in the  

20 

     Table of Contents  

fourth quarter of 2017 as follows: (i) a tax benefit of $3,017 million to re-measure Altria Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries  net deferred tax liabilities based on the new U.S. federal statutory rate; and (ii) a net tax benefit of $763 million for a tax basis adjustment associated with the deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by tax expense of $413 million for the deemed repatriation tax.  Additional tax items for 2017 included tax benefits for the release of a valuation allowance related to deferred income tax assets for foreign tax credit carryforwards; and tax benefits related primarily to the effective settlement in 2017 of the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) audit of Altria Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries  2010-2013 tax years ( IRS 2010-2013 Audit ), partially offset by tax expense for tax reserves related to the calculation of certain foreign tax credits.  Tax items for 2016 primarily included the reversal of tax accruals no longer required.  Tax items for 2015 primarily included the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest due primarily to the closure in August 2015 of the IRS audit of Altria Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries  2007-2009 tax years, partially offset by a reversal of foreign tax credits primarily associated with SABMiller dividends.  For further discussion, see   Note 14  .  
  2017 Compared with 2016 
  The following discussion compares consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016. 
  Net revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, decreased $168 million (0.7%), due primarily to lower net revenues in the smokeable products and wine segments, partially offset by higher net revenues in the smokeless products segment. 
  Cost of sales decreased $203 million (2.6%), due primarily to lower smokeable products segment shipment volume, partially offset by higher per unit settlement charges. 
  Excise taxes on products decreased $325 million (5.1%), due primarily to lower smokeable products segment shipment volume. 
  Marketing, administration and research costs decreased $288 million (10.9%), due primarily to lower costs in the smokeable products segment. 
  Operating income increased $794 million (9.1%), due primarily to higher operating results from the smokeable and smokeless products segments (which included lower asset impairment and exit costs).  
  Interest and other debt expense, net, decreased $42 million (5.6%), due primarily to lower interest costs on debt in 2017 as a result of debt refinancing activities in 2016 and higher interest income due to higher interest rates in 2017. 
  Earnings from Altria Group, Inc. s equity investment in AB InBev/SABMiller, which decreased $263 million (33.1%), were negatively impacted by AB InBev/SABMiller special items.   
  Altria Group, Inc. s effective income tax rate decreased 38.9 percentage points to an effective income tax benefit rate of 4.1%, substantially all of which is due to the Tax Reform Act.  For further discussion, see   Note 14  .  

Net earnings attributable to Altria Group, Inc. of $10,222 million decreased $4,017 million (28.2%), due primarily to a lower gain on the Transaction in 2017 and lower earnings from Altria Group, Inc. s equity investment in AB InBev/SABMiller, partially offset by a lower effective income tax rate, a loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2016 and higher operating income.  Diluted and basic EPS attributable to Altria Group, Inc. of $5.31, each decreased by 27.1% due to lower net earnings attributable to Altria Group, Inc., partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. 
  2016 Compared with 2015 
  The following discussion compares consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016 with the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Net revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, increased $310 million (1.2%), due primarily to higher net revenues in the smokeless products, smokeable products and wine segments.  
  Cost of sales was essentially unchanged as higher per unit settlement charges and NPM Adjustment Items in 2015 were offset by lower shipment volume and lower pension and benefit costs in the smokeable products segment.   
  Excise taxes on products decreased $173 million (2.6%), due primarily to lower smokeable products shipment volume. 
  Marketing, administration and research costs decreased $58 million (2.1%), due primarily to lower costs in the smokeable products segment (which included lower tobacco and health litigation items), partially offset by higher costs in the smokeless products segment.  
  Operating income increased $401 million (4.8%), due primarily to higher operating results from the smokeable products and smokeless products segments (which included asset impairment, exit and implementation costs in connection with the facilities consolidation and productivity initiative in 2016), lower investment spending in the innovative tobacco products businesses, a reduction of a PMI tax-related receivable in 2015 and higher operating results from the financial services business. 
  Interest and other debt expense, net, decreased $70 million (8.6%), due primarily to lower interest costs on debt as a result of a debt maturity in 2015 and debt tender offers in 2016 and 2015. 
  Earnings from Altria Group, Inc. s equity investment in SABMiller, which increased $38 million (5.0%), were positively impacted by SABMiller special items, mostly offset by three fewer months of SABMiller s earnings in 2016 versus 2015, as a result of the timing of the completion of the Transaction.  
  Net earnings attributable to Altria Group, Inc. of $14,239 million increased $8,998 million (171.7%), due primarily to the gain on the Transaction, higher operating income and lower interest and other debt expense, partially offset by a higher loss on early extinguishment of debt.  Diluted and basic EPS attributable to Altria Group, Inc. of $7.28, each increased by

172.7% due to higher net earnings attributable to Altria Group, Inc. and fewer shares outstanding. 

Operating Results by Business Segment  
  Tobacco Space  
  Business Environment  
  Summary 
  The United States tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  These challenges, some of which are discussed in more detail below, in   Note 18  , Item 1A and Item 3, include:  
             
    pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements;  
                
    the requirement to issue  corrective statements  in various media in connection with the federal government s lawsuit;  
                
    restrictions and requirements imposed by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ( FSPTCA ), and restrictions and requirements (and related enforcement actions) that have been, and in the future will be, imposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA    
                
    actual and proposed excise tax increases, as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements;  
                
    bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers;  
                
    other federal, state and local government actions, including:  
                
    increases in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products above the current federal minimum age of 18;  
                
    restrictions on the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments, the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors (such as menthol) and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes;  
                
    additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products;  
                
    other actual and proposed tobacco product legislation and regulation; and  
                
    governmental investigations;  
                
    the diminishing prevalence of cigarette smoking and increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and others (including retail establishments) to further restrict tobacco use;  
                
    changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior, which is influenced by various factors such as economic  

conditions, excise taxes and price gap relationships, may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to discount products or other lower priced tobacco products;   
             
    the highly competitive nature of the tobacco categories in which our tobacco subsidiaries operate, including competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation;  
                
    illicit trade in tobacco products; and  
                
    potential adverse changes in tobacco leaf and other raw material prices, availability and quality.  
     In addition to and in connection with the foregoing, evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences pose challenges for Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries. Our tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories, use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor products.  The e-vapor category grew rapidly from 2012 through early 2015 off a small base, but then slowed.  The growth trend resumed in 2017.  Nu Mark believes the category will continue to be dynamic as adult tobacco consumers explore a variety of tobacco product options. 
  Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing products both within and outside the United States through innovation and adjacency growth strategies (including, where appropriate, arrangements with, or investments in, third parties).  See the discussions regarding new product technologies, adjacency growth strategy and evolving consumer preferences in Item1A for certain risks associated with the foregoing discussion. 
  We have provided additional detail on the following topics below:  
             
    FSPTCA and FDA Regulation;  
                
    Excise Taxes;  
                
    International Treaty on Tobacco Control;  
                
    State Settlement Agreements;  
                
    Other Federal, State and Local Regulation and Activity; 
                
    Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products;  
                
    Price, Availability and Quality of Agricultural Products; and  
                
    Timing of Sales. 
     FSPTCA and FDA Regulation   
     The Regulatory Framework:    The FSPTCA expressly establishes certain restrictions and prohibitions on our tobacco businesses and authorizes or requires further FDA action.  Under the FSPTCA, the FDA has broad authority to (1) regulate the design, manufacture, packaging, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products; (2) require disclosures of related information; and (3) enforce the FSPTCA and related regulations.  The FSPTCA went into effect in 2009 for cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in August 2016 for  

22 

     Table of Contents  

all other tobacco products, including cigars, e-vapor products, pipe tobacco and oral tobacco-derived nicotine products ( Other Tobacco Products ).  See   FDA Regulatory Actions - Deeming Regulations   below.   
  Among other measures, the FSPTCA or its implementing regulations:    
             
    imposes restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products, including at retail; 
                
    bans descriptors such as  light,   mild  or  low  or similar descriptors when used as descriptors of modified risk unless expressly authorized by the FDA; 
                
    requires extensive product disclosures to the FDA and may require public disclosures;   
                
    prohibits any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without FDA authorization;  
                
    imposes reporting obligations relating to contraband activity and grants the FDA authority to impose recordkeeping and other obligations to address illicit trade in tobacco products; 
                
    changes the language of the cigarette and smokeless tobacco product health warnings, enlarges their size and requires the development by the FDA of graphic warnings for cigarettes, establishes warning requirements for Other Tobacco Products, and gives the FDA the authority to require new warnings for any type of tobacco products;  
                
    authorizes the FDA to adopt product regulations and related actions, including imposing tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health (  e.g.  , related to the use of menthol in cigarettes, nicotine yields and other constituents or ingredients) and imposing manufacturing standards for tobacco products (see   FDA s Comprehensive Regulatory Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation, and FDA Regulatory Actions - Product Standards   below);  
                
    establishes pre-market review pathways for new and modified tobacco products for the FDA to follow (see   Pre-Market Review Pathways Including Substantial Equivalence   below); and 
                
    equips the FDA with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools, including the authority to inspect tobacco product manufacturing and other facilities. 
        Pre-Market Review Pathways Including Substantial Equivalence:    The FSPTCA imposes restrictions on marketing new and modified tobacco products, requiring FDA review to begin marketing a new product or continue marketing a modified product. Specifically, cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market after March 22, 2011, and Other Tobacco Products modified or first introduced into the market after August 8, 2016, are subjected to new tobacco product application and pre-market review and authorization requirements unless a manufacturer can demonstrate they are  substantially equivalent  to products commercially marketed as of February 15, 2007.  The FDA could deny any such  

new tobacco product application, thereby preventing the distribution and sale of any product affected by such denial.   
  For cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 ( provisional products ) for which a manufacturer submitted substantial equivalence reports that the FDA determines are not  substantially equivalent  to products commercially marketed as of February 15, 2007, the FDA could require the removal of such products from the marketplace (see   FDA Regulatory Actions   -   Substantial Equivalence and Other New Product Processes/Pathways   below). 
  Similarly, the FDA could determine that Other Tobacco Products modified or first introduced into the market between February 15, 2007 and August 8, 2016 for which a manufacturer submits substantial equivalence reports that the FDA determines are not  substantially equivalent  to products commercially marketed as of February 15, 2007, or rejects a new tobacco product application submitted by a manufacturer, both of which could require the removal of such products from the marketplace (see   FDA s Comprehensive Regulatory Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation,   and   FDA Regulatory Actions   -   Substantial Equivalence and Other New Product Processes/Pathways   below). 
    Modifications to currently-marketed products, including modifications that result from, for example, a supplier being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients or a manufacturer being unable to obtain the ingredients with the required specifications, can trigger the FDA s pre-market review process described above.  As noted, adverse determinations by the FDA during that process could restrict a manufacturer s ability to continue marketing such products.  
     FDA s Comprehensive Regulatory Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation:    In July 2017, the FDA announced a new comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation that will serve as the FDA s multi-year regulatory road map (the  July 2017 Comprehensive Plan ).  The FDA has stated its belief that this approach will strike an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes.  Major components of the July 2017 Comprehensive Plan include the following:    
     the FDA s planned issuance of advance notices of proposed rulemaking ( ANPRM ) seeking comments for potential future regulations establishing product standards for (i) nicotine in combustible cigarettes, (ii) flavors in tobacco products and (iii) e-vapor products (see   FDA Regulatory Actions - Product Standards   below); 
     the FDA s planned extension of the timelines to submit applications for Other Tobacco Products that were on the market as of August 8, 2016, which the FDA extended in August 2017 (see   FDA Regulatory Actions - Substantial Equivalence and Other New Product Processes/Pathways   below);   

23 

     Table of Contents  

the FDA s reconsideration of whether its current plan, which is to review all  provisional  products pending in the substantial equivalence queue, is an effective use of its resources and, if not, whether it should continue to pursue its current approach to these reviews (see   FDA Regulatory Actions - Substantial Equivalence and Other New Product Processes/Pathways   below).  As previously noted, a  provisional  product refers to cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products modified or first commercially available after February 15, 2007 and before March 22, 2011; and  
     the FDA s planned issuance of foundational regulations identifying the information the FDA expects to be included in substantial equivalence reports and applications for  new tobacco products  and  modified risk tobacco products.   The FDA also plans to finalize guidance on how it intends to review new product applications for e-vapor products. 
     Implementation Timing, Rulemaking and Guidance:    The implementation of the FSPTCA began in 2009 for cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in August 2016 for Other Tobacco Products and will continue over time.  The provisions of the FSPTCA that require the FDA to take action through rulemaking generally involve consideration of public comment and, for some issues, scientific review.  As required by the FSPTCA, the FDA has established a tobacco product scientific advisory committee (the  TPSAC ), which consists of voting and non-voting members, to provide advice, reports, information and recommendations to the FDA on scientific and health issues relating to tobacco products.  TPSAC votes are considered by the FDA, but are not binding.  From time to time, the FDA issues guidance that also generally involves public comment, which may be issued in draft or final form.  
  Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries participate actively in processes established by the FDA to develop and implement the FSPTCA s regulatory framework, including submission of comments to various FDA proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions.   
  The implementation of the FSPTCA and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states, territories and localities of the United States of their laws and regulations as well as of the State Settlement Agreements discussed below (see   State Settlement Agreements   below).  Such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries  ability to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states, territories and localities.  
     Impact on Our Business; Compliance Costs and User Fees:    Regulations imposed and other regulatory actions taken by the FDA under the FSPTCA could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries in a number of different ways. For example, actions by the FDA could:  
             
    impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products;  

delay, discontinue or prevent the sale or distribution of existing, new or modified tobacco products;  
                
    limit adult tobacco consumer choices;  
                
    impose restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers;  
                
    create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies;  
                
    impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packaging requirements; 
                
    impose additional restrictions at retail; 
                
    result in increased illicit trade in tobacco products; or 
                
    otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business.  
     The failure to comply with FDA regulatory requirements, even inadvertently, and FDA enforcement actions could also have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries. 
  The FSPTCA imposes user fees on cigarette, cigarette tobacco, smokeless tobacco, cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters.  The FSPTCA does not impose user fees on e-vapor product manufacturers.  The cost of the FDA user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to FDA regulation and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares, all as prescribed by the statute and FDA regulations.  Payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, market share and industry volume.  For a discussion of the impact of the FDA user fee payments on Altria Group, Inc., see   Financial Review - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation   below.  In addition, compliance with the FSPTCA s regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for our tobacco businesses.  The amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date period but could become material, either individually or in the aggregate, to one or more of our tobacco subsidiaries. 
     Investigation and Enforcement:    The FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it, including document requests and other required information submissions, facility inspections, examinations and investigations, injunction proceedings, monetary penalties, product withdrawal and recall orders, and product seizures.  The use of any of these investigatory or enforcement tools by the FDA could result in significant costs to the tobacco businesses of Altria Group, Inc. or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.

Final Tobacco Marketing Rule:    As required by the FSPTCA, the FDA re-promulgated in March 2010 a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions in substantially the same form as regulations that were previously adopted in 1996 (but never imposed on tobacco manufacturers due to a United States Supreme Court ruling) (the  Final Tobacco Marketing Rule ).  The May 2016 amendments to the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule (instituted as part of the FDA s deeming regulations) apply certain provisions to certain  covered tobacco products,  which include cigars, e-vapor products containing nicotine or other tobacco derivatives, pipe tobacco and oral tobacco-derived nicotine products, but do not include any component or part that is not made or derived from tobacco.  The Final Tobacco Marketing Rule as so amended: 
             
    bans the use of color and graphics in cigarette and smokeless tobacco product labeling and advertising; 
                
    prohibits the sale of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and covered tobacco products to persons under the age of 18;  
                
    restricts the use of non-tobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products;  
                
    requires the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in direct, face-to-face transactions;  
                
    prohibits sampling of cigarettes and covered tobacco products and prohibits sampling of smokeless tobacco products except in qualified adult-only facilities;  
                
    prohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with cigarette or smokeless tobacco brands or logos; and  
                
    prohibits cigarettes and smokeless tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic, musical, artistic or other social or cultural event, or any entry or team in any event.  
     Subject to the limitations described below, the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule took effect in June 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products and in August 2016 for covered tobacco products.  At the time of the re-promulgation of the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, the FDA also issued an ANPRM regarding the so-called  1000 foot rule,  which would establish restrictions on the placement of outdoor tobacco advertising in relation to schools and playgrounds.  PM USA and USSTC submitted comments on this ANPRM. 
  Since enactment in 2009, several lawsuits have been filed challenging various provisions of the FSPTCA, the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule and the deeming regulations, including their constitutionality and the scope of the FDA s authority thereunder.  One lawsuit challenged the constitutionality of an FDA regulation that restricts tobacco manufacturers from using the trade or brand name of a non-tobacco product on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products.  The case was dismissed and the FDA agreed not to enforce the current or any amended trade name rule until at least 180 days after rulemaking on the amended rule concludes.      In November 2011, the FDA proposed an amended rule, but has not yet issued a final rule.  PM USA and USSTC submitted comments on the proposed amended rule. 

FDA Regulatory Actions  
             
    Graphic Warnings  :  In June 2011, as required by the FSPTCA, the FDA issued its final rule to modify the required warnings that appear on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements.  The FSPTCA requires the warnings to consist of nine new textual warning statements accompanied by color graphics depicting the negative health consequences of smoking.  The graphic health warnings will (i) be located beneath the cellophane, and comprise the top 50% of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages and (ii) occupy 20% of a cigarette advertisement and be located at the top of the advertisement.  After a legal challenge to the rule initiated by R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard and several other plaintiffs, in which plaintiffs prevailed both at the federal trial and appellate levels, the FDA decided not to seek further review of the U.S. Court of Appeals  decision and announced its plans to propose a new graphic warnings rule in the future.    
                
    Substantial Equivalence and Other New Product Processes/Pathways  :  In general, in order to continue marketing provisional products, manufacturers of such products were required to send to the FDA a report demonstrating substantial equivalence by March 22, 2011 for the FDA to determine if such tobacco products are  substantially equivalent  to products commercially available as of February 15, 2007.  All cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are provisional products, as are some of the products currently marketed by Nat Sherman.  Our subsidiaries submitted timely substantial equivalence reports for these provisional products and can continue marketing these products unless the FDA makes a determination that a specific provisional product is not substantially equivalent.  If the FDA ultimately makes such a determination, it could require the removal of such products from the marketplace.  PM USA and USSTC also submitted substantial equivalence reports on products proposed to be marketed after March 22, 2011 ( non-provisional  products).  While our cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries believe all of their current products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict whether, when or how the FDA ultimately will apply its guidance to their various respective substantial equivalence reports or seek to enforce the law and regulations consistent with its guidance.   
     PM USA and USSTC have received decisions on certain provisional and non-provisional products, some of which were found to be substantially equivalent and others were found to be not substantially equivalent.  The provisional products (all smokeless tobacco products) found to be not substantially equivalent had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA s determination; therefore, the determinations did not impact business results.  In February 2018, USSTC filed a lawsuit challenging the FDA s determination that certain of its non-provisional products are not substantially equivalent. There remain a significant number of substantial equivalence reports for products for  

25 

     Table of Contents  

which the FDA has not announced decisions.  At the request of the FDA, our cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries have provided additional information with respect to certain of these substantial equivalence reports.  We cannot predict whether this additional information will be satisfactory to the FDA to result in substantial equivalence determinations for the products covered by those reports.  It is also not possible to predict how long reviews by the FDA of substantial equivalence reports or new tobacco product applications for any tobacco product will take.  A  not substantially equivalent  determination or denial of a new tobacco product application on one or more products could have a material adverse impact on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries. 
  In order to continue marketing Other Tobacco Products modified or introduced into the market for the first time between February 15, 2007 and August 8, 2016, manufacturers originally were required to send to the FDA a report demonstrating substantial equivalence by May 8, 2018 or a new tobacco product application by November 8, 2018.  In August 2017, the FDA extended the filing deadlines for combustible Other Tobacco Products, such as cigars and pipe tobacco, to August 8, 2021, and for non-combustible Other Tobacco Products, such as e-vapor and oral nicotine products, to August 8, 2022.  The FDA also announced that it will permit manufacturers to continue to market such Other Tobacco Products until the FDA renders a decision on the applicable substantial equivalence report or new tobacco product application.  
  Because of the limited number of e-vapor products on the market as of February 15, 2007, Nu Mark may not be able to file substantial equivalence reports with the FDA on its e-vapor products in the market as of August 8, 2016.  In such case, Nu Mark would have to file new tobacco product applications which, among other things, demonstrate that the marketing of the e-vapor products would be appropriate for the protection of the public health.  It is uncertain how the FDA will interpret the requirements for obtaining a  new tobacco product marketing order,  although as noted above the FDA has indicated its intention to issue appropriate regulations to clarify the requirements.    
  Manufacturers intending to first introduce new and modified cigarette, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products into the market after March 22, 2011 or intending to first introduce new and modified Other Tobacco Products into the market after August 8, 2016, must submit substantial equivalence reports to the FDA and obtain  substantial equivalence orders  from the FDA or submit new tobacco product applications to the FDA and obtain  new tobacco product marketing orders  from the FDA before introducing the products into the market. 
  In March 2015, the FDA issued a document entitled  Guidance for Industry: Demonstrating the Substantial Equivalence of a New Tobacco Product:  Responses to Frequently Asked Questions  ( Substantial Equivalence  

Guidance ).  In that document, the FDA announced that (i) certain label changes and (ii) changes to the quantity of tobacco product(s) in a package would each require submission of newly required substantial equivalence reports and authorization from the FDA prior to marketing tobacco products with such changes, even when the tobacco product itself is not changed.  Our cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries market various products that fall within the scope of the Substantial Equivalence Guidance.  
  In September 2015, after industry objections to the Substantial Equivalence Guidance, the FDA issued a second edition of the guidance (the  Revised SE Guidance ), which continued to require FDA pre-authorization for certain label changes and for product quantity changes.  PM USA, USSTC and other tobacco product manufacturers initiated litigation challenging the Revised SE Guidance.  In August 2016, the court held that a modification to an existing product s label does not result in a  new tobacco product  and therefore such a label change does not give rise to the substantial equivalence review process. However, the court upheld the Revised SE Guidance in all other respects, including its treatment of product quantity changes as modifications that give rise to a new tobacco product requiring substantial equivalence review.   
             
    Deeming Regulations:    As discussed above under   FSPTCA and FDA Regulation - The Regulatory Framework  , in May 2016, the FDA issued final regulations for all Other Tobacco Products, imposing the FSPTCA regulatory framework on the tobacco products manufactured, marketed and sold by Middleton and Nu Mark.  At the same time the FDA issued its final deeming regulations, it also amended the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule as described above in   FSPTCA and FDA Regulation - Final Tobacco Marketing Rule.    Under the new regulations, for Other Tobacco Products modified or introduced into the market for the first time between February 15, 2007 and August 8, 2016, manufacturers must demonstrate substantial equivalence to a product on the market as of February 15, 2007 or obtain a  new tobacco marketing order  by certain specified dates to continue marketing those products.  For further details, see   FSPTCA and FDA Regulation - FDA Regulatory Actions - Substantial Equivalence and Other New Product Processes/Pathways   above  .    
     Among the FSPTCA requirements that apply to Other Tobacco Products is a ban on descriptors, including  mild,  when used as descriptors of modified risk unless expressly authorized by the FDA.  In May 2016, Middleton filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the FDA challenging the application of the descriptor ban on the use of the word  mild  as it relates to the  Black   Mild  trademark.  In July 2016, the Department of Justice, on behalf of the FDA, informed Middleton that at present the FDA does not intend to bring an enforcement action against Middleton for the use of the term  mild  in the trademark  Black   Mild.   Consequently, Middleton dismissed its  

26 

     Table of Contents  

lawsuit without prejudice.  If the FDA were to change its mind at some later date, Middleton would have the opportunity to make a submission to the FDA and ultimately, if necessary, to bring another lawsuit. 
             
    Potential Product Standards 
                
    Menthol in cigarettes:    As required by the FSPTCA, the TPSAC submitted a report on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health and related recommendations to the FDA in March 2011.  It recommended, among other things, that the  [r]emoval of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States  and also noted that any ban on menthol cigarettes could lead to an increase in contraband cigarettes and other potential unintended consequences.   Also in March 2011, PM USA submitted a report to the FDA outlining its position that regulatory actions related to the use of menthol cigarettes are not warranted based on available science and evidence and that any significant restrictions on the use of menthol in cigarettes would have unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society.   
     In July 2013, the FDA released its preliminary scientific evaluation on menthol, which states  that menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with non-menthol cigarettes.   At the same time, the FDA also issued an ANPRM requesting comments on the FDA s preliminary scientific evaluation and information that may inform potential regulatory actions regarding menthol in cigarettes.  PM USA submitted comments to the FDA raising a number of concerns about the preliminary scientific evidence and unintended consequences.   
  The July 2017 Comprehensive Plan contemplates the issuance of an ANPRM seeking comments on the role that flavors including menthol in tobacco products play in attracting youth.  No future action can be taken by the FDA to regulate the manufacture, marketing or sale of menthol cigarettes (including a possible ban) until the completion of a full rulemaking process. 
             
    NNN in Smokeless Tobacco  : In January 2017, the FDA proposed a product standard for N-nitrosonornicotine ( NNN ) levels in finished smokeless tobacco products.  USSTC believes that the FDA has not adequately considered whether the proposed standard is technically achievable and further believes it would have a significant negative impact on farmers and manufacturers.  USSTC is advocating for withdrawal of the proposed rule.  In March 2017, the FDA extended the comment period and acknowledged what it described as a  typographical error  in a formula it used in documentation supporting the proposed rule.  USSTC submitted comments to the FDA in July 2017.  If the proposed rule as presently proposed were to become final and upheld in the courts, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and USSTC. 

Nicotine and Flavors  :  As noted above, the FDA announced in the July 2017 Comprehensive Plan its intent to seek comments through an ANPRM on the following matters, among others:   
                
    Nicotine in cigarettes:   The potential public health benefits and any possible adverse effects of lowering nicotine in combustible cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels through achievable product standards.  Specifically, the FDA intends to seek comments on the potential unintended consequences of such product standard, including (i) smokers compensating by smoking more cigarettes to obtain the same level of nicotine as with their current product and (ii) the illicit trade of cigarettes containing nicotine at levels higher than a non-addictive threshold that may be established by the FDA; and 
                
    Flavors in all tobacco products:   The role that flavors (including menthol) in tobacco products play in attracting youth and may play in helping some smokers switch to potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery. 
     These ANPRM processes may ultimately lead to the FDA s development of product standards for nicotine and flavors.  The July 2017 Comprehensive Plan also includes the FDA s intent to develop e-vapor product standards to protect against known public health risks such as battery issues and concerns about children s exposure to liquid nicotine. 
             
    Good Manufacturing Practices  :  The FSPTCA requires that the FDA promulgate good manufacturing practice regulations (referred to by the FDA as  Requirements for Tobacco Product Manufacturing Practice ) for tobacco product manufacturers, but does not specify a timeframe for such regulations.  
     Excise Taxes 
  Tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States.  Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted (including with respect to e-vapor products) and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States.    
  Federal, state and local excise taxes have increased substantially over the past decade, far outpacing the rate of inflation.  By way of example, in 2009, the federal excise tax ( FET ) on cigarettes increased from $0.39 per pack to approximately $1.01 per pack, in 2010, the New York state excise tax increased by $1.60 to $4.35 per pack, in October 2014, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania enacted a $2.00 per pack local cigarette excise tax and in November 2016, California passed a ballot measure to increase its cigarette excise tax by $2.00 per pack and its smokeless tobacco ad valorem excise tax from 27.30% to 65.08%, which went into effect on April 1, 2017 and July 1, 2017, respectively.  Between the end of 1998 and February 23, 2018, the weighted-average state and certain local cigarette excise taxes increased from $0.36 to $1.75 per pack.  During  

27 

     Table of Contents  

2017, Rhode Island, Delaware, Connecticut and Puerto Rico enacted legislation to increase their cigarette excise taxes.  As of February 23, 2018, no state has increased its cigarette excise tax in 2018, but various increases are under consideration or have been proposed.  
  Tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments or to other low-priced or low-taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products.  Such shifts may have an adverse impact on the sales volume and reported share performance of tobacco products of Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries.  
  A majority of states currently tax smokeless tobacco products using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price. This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight.  Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on smokeless tobacco to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax.  As of February 23, 2018, the federal government, 23 states, Puerto Rico, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for smokeless tobacco.   
  International Treaty on Tobacco Control  
  The World Health Organization s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the  FCTC ) entered into force in February 2005.  As of February 23, 2018, 180 countries, as well as the European Community, have become parties to the FCTC.  While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the United States Senate.  The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation.  The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would, among other things:  establish specific actions to prevent youth tobacco product use; restrict or eliminate all tobacco product advertising, marketing, promotion and sponsorship; initiate public education campaigns to inform the public about the health consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and the benefits of quitting; implement regulations imposing product testing, disclosure and performance standards; impose health warning requirements on packaging; adopt measures intended to combat tobacco product smuggling and counterfeit tobacco products, including tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain; and restrict smoking in public places. 
  There are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products.  In addition, the  

Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (the  Protocol ) was approved by the Conference of Parties to the FCTC in November 2012.  It includes provisions related to the tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and numerous other provisions regarding the regulation of the manufacture, distribution and sale of tobacco products.  The Protocol has not yet entered into force, but in any event will not apply to the United States until the Senate ratifies the FCTC and until the President signs, and the Senate ratifies, the Protocol.  It is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any FCTC actions on legislation or regulation in the United States, either indirectly or as a result of the United States becoming a party to the FCTC, or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence FDA regulation and enforcement.  
  State Settlement Agreements 
  As discussed in   Note 18  , during 1997 and 1998, PM USA and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into the State Settlement Agreements.  These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume.  For a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria Group, Inc., see   Financial Review - Debt and Liquidity - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation   below and   Note 18  .  The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers  business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.  Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities).  Restrictions are also placed on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products.  The State Settlement Agreements also place prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters.  In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents; limit the industry s ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations. 
  In November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the  STMSA ) with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC.  The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions.  USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.

     Table of Contents  

Other Federal, State and Local Regulation and Activity 
     Federal, State and Local Regulation  :  A number of states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor products), such as legislation that (1) prohibits the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors, including menthol cigarettes, (2) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally-mandated health warnings and (3) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products (including proposals to ban all tobacco product sales).  The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. 
  Whether other states or localities will enact legislation in these areas, and the precise nature of such legislation if enacted, cannot be predicted.  Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries have challenged and will continue to challenge certain state and local legislation, including through litigation.  
     State and Local Legislation to Increase the Legal Age to Purchase Tobacco Products:    An increasing number of states and localities have proposed legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase tobacco products above the current Federal minimum age of 18.  The following states have enacted such legislation: California (21), Hawaii (21), Alabama (19), Alaska (19), New Jersey (21), Utah (19), Oregon (21) and Maine (21).  Various localities (such as New York City (21) and Chicago (21)) have taken similar actions.  
     Health Effects of Tobacco Product Consumption and Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke ( ETS ):    Reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years, including various reports by the U.S. Surgeon General.  Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the United States Surgeon General and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products. 
  Most jurisdictions within the United States have restricted smoking in public places.  Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars transporting minors.  It is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on regulation.  

Other Legislation or Governmental Initiatives:    In addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions.  For example, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards (such as reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards); establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs, or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; require tax stamping of moist smokeless tobacco ( MST ) products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products.  Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful. 
  It is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally.  It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries. 
     Governmental Investigations:    From time to time, Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.  Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced.  
  Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products 
  Illicit trade in tobacco products can have an adverse impact on the businesses of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.  Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another.  Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments.  Counterfeit versions of our tobacco subsidiaries  products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands.  Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries have made in legitimate distribution channels.  Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax  

29 

     Table of Contents  

revenues.  Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated results of operations and cash flows and the businesses of its tobacco subsidiaries; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.  
  Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries devote significant resources to help prevent illicit trade in tobacco products and to protect legitimate trade channels.  For example, Altria Group, Inc. s tobacco subsidiaries are engaged in a number of initiatives to help prevent illicit trade in tobacco products, including communication with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities; enforcement of wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products; engagement with and support of law enforcement and regulatory agencies; litigation to protect their trademarks; and support for a variety of federal and state legislative initiatives.  Legislative initiatives to address illicit trade in tobacco products are designed to protect the legitimate channels of distribution, impose more stringent penalties for the violation of illegal trade laws and provide additional tools for law enforcement.  Regulatory measures and related governmental actions to prevent the illicit manufacture and trade of tobacco products continue to evolve as the nature of illicit tobacco products evolves. 
  Price, Availability and Quality of Agricultural Products 
  Shifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government mandated prices, economic trade sanctions, geopolitical instability and production control programs may increase or decrease the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our companies  products.  As with other agriculture commodities, the price of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change.  Tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs.  Changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production could impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply.  Certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability, and loss of their availability could impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.  Any significant change in the price, quality or availability of tobacco leaf or other agricultural products used to manufacture our products could restrict our subsidiaries  ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability, adversely affecting our subsidiaries  profitability and businesses.  

Timing of Sales 
  In the ordinary course of business, our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers, including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events, the timing of promotions, customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs, as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and tax-driven price increases. 

Operating Results 
  The following table summarizes operating results for the smokeable and smokeless products segments:   

  Smokeable Products Segment 
  The smokeable products segment s operating companies income increased during   2017   due primarily to higher pricing and lower costs, partially offset by lower shipment volume.  Shipment volume and retail share were negatively impacted in 2017 by a large cigarette excise tax increase in California.  
  The following table summarizes the smokeable products segment shipment volume performance: 

Cigarettes shipment volume includes   Marlboro  ; Other premium brands, such as   Virginia Slims  ,   Parliament   and   Benson   Hedges  ; and Discount brands, which include   L M   and   Basic.    Cigarettes volume includes units sold as well as promotional units, but excludes units sold for distribution to

     Table of Contents  

Puerto Rico, and units sold in U.S. Territories, to overseas military and by Philip Morris Duty Free Inc., none of which, individually or in the aggregate, is material to the smokeable products segment. 
  The following table summarizes cigarettes retail share performance:   

  Retail share results for cigarettes are based on data from IRI/Management Science Associate Inc., a tracking service that uses a sample of stores and certain wholesale shipments to project market share and depict share trends.  This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes.  For other trade classes selling cigarettes, retail share is based on shipments from wholesalers to retailers through the Store Tracking Analytical Reporting System ( STARS ).  This service is not designed to capture sales through other channels, including the internet, direct mail and some illicitly tax-advantaged outlets. It is IRI s standard practice to periodically refresh its services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.     
  PM USA and Middleton executed the following pricing and promotional allowance actions during   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  :  
     Effective September 24, 2017, PM USA increased the list price on all of its cigarette brands by $0.10 per pack. 
     Effective May 21, 2017, Middleton increased various list prices across substantially all of its cigar brands resulting in a weighted-average increase of approximately $0.10 per five-pack. 
     Effective March 19, 2017, PM USA increased the list price on   Parliament   by $0.12 per pack.  In addition, PM USA increased the list price on all of its other cigarette brands by $0.08 per pack. 
     Effective November 13, 2016, PM USA reduced its wholesale promotional allowance on   Marlboro   by $0.02 per pack and   L M   by $0.08 per pack.  In addition, PM USA increased the list price on   Marlboro   by $0.06 per pack and on all of its other cigarette brands by $0.08 per pack, except for   L M  , which had no list price change. 
     Effective May 15, 2016, PM USA increased the list price on all of its cigarette brands by $0.07 per pack. 
     Effective November 15, 2015, PM USA increased the list price on all of its cigarette brands by $0.07 per pack. 

Effective May 17, 2015, PM USA increased the list price on all of its cigarette brands by $0.07 per pack. 
  The following discussion compares operating results for the smokeable products segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016. 
  Net revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, decreased $215 million (0.9%), due primarily to lower shipment volume ($1,273 million), partially offset by higher pricing, which includes higher promotional investments.   
  Operating companies income increased $640 million (8.2%), due primarily to higher pricing ($1,023 million), which includes higher promotional investments, lower marketing, administration and research costs ($251 million), which includes 2016 state excise tax ballot initiative spending and lower product liability defense costs, and lower asset impairment and exit costs ($120 million).  These factors were partially offset by lower shipment volume ($691 million) and higher per unit settlement charges. 
  Marketing, administration and research costs for the smokeable products segment include PM USA s cost of administering and litigating product liability claims.  Litigation defense costs are influenced by a number of factors, including the number and types of cases filed, the number of cases tried annually, the results of trials and appeals, the development of the law controlling relevant legal issues, and litigation strategy and tactics.  For further discussion on these matters, see   Note 18   and Item 3.  For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, product liability defense costs for PM USA were $179 million, $234 million and $228 million, respectively.  The factors that have influenced past product liability defense costs are expected to continue to influence future costs.  PM USA does not expect future product liability defense costs to be significantly different from product liability defense costs incurred in the last few years. 
  Total smokeable products segment s reported shipment volume decreased 5.0%.  The smokeable products segment s reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume decreased 5.1%, driven primarily by the industry s rate of decline, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day.  When adjusted for calendar differences, the smokeable products segment s domestic cigarettes shipment volume decreased an estimated 5%.  Total cigarette industry volumes declined by an estimated 4%.   
  Shipments of premium cigarettes accounted for   90.9%   of smokeable products  reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume for 2017, versus   90.8%   for 2016. 
  The smokeable products segment s reported cigars shipment volume increased   9.9%  . 
  Marlboro s retail share declined 0.4 share points, driven primarily by competitive activity and the effect of the cigarette excise tax increase in California.  PM USA s total retail share decreased 0.4 share points. 
  The following discussion compares operating results for the smokeable products segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 with the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, increased $59 million (0.3%), due primarily to higher pricing, which includes higher promotional investments, partially offset by lower shipment volume ($577 million).   
  Operating companies income increased $199 million (2.6%), due primarily to higher pricing, which includes higher promotional investments, lower costs (due primarily to lower pension and benefit costs) and lower tobacco and health litigation items ($39 million).  These factors were partially offset by lower shipment volume ($298 million), higher per unit settlement charges, costs in connection with the productivity initiative and facilities consolidation ($134 million) and NPM Adjustment Items in 2015 ($97 million).     
  Total smokeable products segment s reported shipment volume decreased 2.4%.  The smokeable products segment s reported and adjusted domestic cigarettes shipment volume decreased approximately 2.5% driven primarily by the industry s rate of decline.  Total cigarette industry volumes declined by an estimated 2.5%.  
  Shipments of premium cigarettes accounted for   90.8%   of smokeable products  reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume for 2016, versus   91.2%   for 2015. 
  Middleton s reported cigars shipment volume increased   5.9%  , driven primarily by   Black   Mild   in the tipped cigars segment. 
    Marlboro   s retail share declined 0.1 share point in 2016.  PM USA s total retail share was unchanged in 2016.  
  Smokeless Products Segment 
  During   2017  , the smokeless products segment grew net revenues and operating companies income, primarily through higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix and lower shipment volume.  
  During 2017, USSTC voluntarily recalled certain smokeless tobacco products manufactured at its Franklin Park, Illinois facility due to a product tampering incident (the  Recall ).  USSTC has concluded the Recall and trade inventories have been replenished.  USSTC estimates that the Recall reduced smokeless products segment operating companies income by approximately   $60 million   in 2017. 
  The following table summarizes smokeless products segment shipment volume performance:     

Smokeless products shipment volume includes cans and packs sold, as well as promotional units, but excludes international volume, which is not material to the smokeless products segment.  New types of smokeless products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing smokeless products,  

may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can-for-can basis.  To calculate volumes of cans and packs shipped, one pack of snus, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST.   
  The following table summarizes smokeless products segment retail share performance (excluding international volume):    

    Retail share results for smokeless products are based on data from IRI InfoScan, a tracking service that uses a sample of stores to project market share and depict share trends.  This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes on the number of cans and packs sold.  Smokeless products is defined by IRI as moist smokeless and spit-free tobacco products.  New types of smokeless products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing smokeless products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can-for-can basis.  For example, one pack of snus, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST.  Because this service represents retail share performance only in key trade channels, it should not be considered a precise measurement of actual retail share.  It is IRI s standard practice to periodically refresh its InfoScan services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.

Wine Segment 
  Business Environment 
  Ste. Michelle is a leading producer of Washington state wines, primarily   Chateau Ste. Michelle  ,   Columbia Crest   and   14 Hands  , and owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other domestic and foreign wine regions.  Ste. Michelle holds an 85% ownership interest in Michelle-Antinori, LLC, which owns   Stag s Leap Wine Cellars   in Napa Valley.  Ste. Michelle also owns   Conn Creek   in Napa Valley,   Patz   Hall   in Sonoma and   Erath   in Oregon.  In addition, Ste. Michelle imports and markets   Antinori  ,   Torres   and   Villa Maria Estate   wines and   Champagne Nicolas Feuillatte   in the United States.  Key elements of Ste. Michelle s strategy are expanded domestic distribution of its wines, especially in certain account categories such as restaurants, wholesale clubs, supermarkets, wine shops and mass merchandisers, and a focus on improving product mix to higher-priced, premium products.  
  Ste. Michelle s business is subject to significant competition, including competition from many larger, well-established domestic and international companies, as well as from many smaller wine producers.  Wine segment competition is primarily based on quality, price, consumer and trade wine tastings, competitive wine judging, third-party acclaim and advertising.  Substantially all of Ste. Michelle s sales occur in the United States through state-licensed distributors.  Ste. Michelle also sells to domestic consumers through retail and e-commerce channels and exports wines to international distributors. 
  Federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the beverage alcohol industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing rules, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies.  Further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on Ste. Michelle s wine business. 

Operating Results  
  Ste. Michelle s results for 2017 were negatively impacted by competitive activity, continued trade inventory reductions and slower premium wine category growth.  
  The following table summarizes operating results for the wine segment:

  Financial Review 
  Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
  During   2017  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $4.9 billion   compared with   $3.8 billion   during   2016  .  This increase was due primarily to the following:  
             
    income taxes paid on both the cash proceeds from the Transaction and gains from exercising derivative financial instruments associated with the Transaction in 2016;  
                
    higher operating companies income in the smokeable and smokeless products segments; 
                
    lower contributions to Altria Group, Inc. s pension and postretirement plans in 2017; and 
                
    lower payments for tobacco and health litigation items in 2017; 
     partially offset by: 
     
  During   2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $3.8 billion   compared with   $5.8 billion   during   2015  .  This decrease was due primarily to the following:  
             
    income taxes paid on both the cash proceeds from the Transaction and gains from exercising derivative financial instruments associated with the Transaction in 2016; and 
                
    voluntary contributions totaling $500 million to Altria Group, Inc. s pension plans during 2016; 
     partially offset by: 
             
    higher cumulative dividends received from AB InBev and SABMiller in 2016. 

Altria Group, Inc. had a working capital deficit at December 31, 2017 and   2016  .  Altria Group, Inc. s management believes that it has the ability to fund these working capital deficits with cash provided by operating activities and/or short-term borrowings under its commercial paper program as discussed in the   Debt and Liquidity   section below. 
  Net Cash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities 
  During   2017  , net cash used in investing activities was   $0.5 billion   compared with net cash provided by investing activities of   $3.7 billion   during   2016  .  This change was due primarily to the following: 
              
    proceeds of   $0.5 billion   from exercising derivative financial instruments associated with the Transaction during 2016; and  
                
    higher acquisitions of businesses and assets in 2017; 
     partially offset by: 
             
    payment of approximately   $1.6 billion   for the purchase of ordinary shares of AB InBev during 2016. 
     During   2016  , net cash provided by investing activities was   $3.7 billion   compared with net cash used in investing activities of   $15 million   during   2015  .  This change was due primarily to the following: 
              
    proceeds of   $0.5 billion   from exercising derivative financial instruments associated with the Transaction during 2016;  
     partially offset by: 
             
    payment of approximately   $1.6 billion   for the purchase of ordinary shares of AB InBev during 2016. 
     Capital expenditures for   2017   increased   5.3%   to   $199 million  , due primarily to the acquisition of the previously leased headquarters in Richmond, Virginia in 2017, partially offset by lower spending related to manufacturing.  Capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million, and are expected to be funded from operating cash flows.  The increase in expected capital expenditures in 2018 compared with 2017 is due primarily to spending related to manufacturing.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
  During   2017  , net cash used in financing activities was   $7.8 billion   compared with   $5.3 billion   during 2016.  This increase was due to the following: 
             
    debt issuance of $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes during 2016 used in part to repurchase senior unsecured notes in connection with the 2016 debt tender offer;  
                
    higher repurchases of common stock during 2017; and 
      partially offset by: 
             
    debt repayments of $0.9 billion and premiums and fees of $0.8 billion in connection with the debt tender offer during 2016.  
     During   2016  , net cash used in financing activities was   $5.3 billion   compared with $6.8 billion during 2015.  This decrease was due primarily to the following: 
             
    debt issuance of $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes during 2016 used in part to repurchase senior unsecured notes in connection with the 2016 debt tender offer; and 
                
    $1.0 billion repayment of Altria Group, Inc. senior unsecured notes at scheduled maturity in 2015;  
     partially offset by: 
             
    higher premiums, fees and repayments of debt in connection with debt tender offers during 2016; 
                
    higher repurchases of common stock during 2016; and 
      Debt and Liquidity  
  Credit Ratings   - Altria Group, Inc. s cost and terms of financing and its access to commercial paper markets may be impacted by applicable credit ratings.   The impact of credit ratings on the cost of borrowings under Altria Group, Inc. s credit agreement is discussed below.  See the discussion in Item 1A regarding the potential adverse impact of certain events on Altria Group, Inc. s credit ratings. 
  At   December 31, 2017  , the credit ratings and outlook for Altria Group, Inc. s indebtedness by major credit rating agencies were:

  Credit Lines   - From time to time, Altria Group, Inc. has short-term borrowing needs to meet its working capital requirements and generally uses its commercial paper program to meet those needs.   

At December 31, 2017,   2016   and   2015  , Altria Group, Inc. had   no   short-term borrowings.   
  At December 31, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. had in place a senior unsecured 5-year revolving credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ).  The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of   $3.0 billion   and expires August 19, 2020.   
  Pricing for interest and fees under the Credit Agreement may be modified in the event of a change in the rating of Altria Group, Inc. s long-term senior unsecured debt.  Interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement are expected to be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a percentage based on the higher of the ratings of Altria Group, Inc. s long-term senior unsecured debt from Moody s and Standard   Poor s.  The applicable percentage based on Altria Group, Inc. s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings at   December 31, 2017   for borrowings under the Credit Agreement was   1.125%  .  The Credit Agreement does not include any other rating triggers, nor does it contain any provisions that could require the posting of collateral.  At   December 31, 2017  , credit available to Altria Group, Inc. under the Credit Agreement was $3.0 billion.   
  The Credit Agreement is used for general corporate purposes and to support Altria Group, Inc. s commercial paper issuances.  The Credit Agreement requires that Altria Group, Inc. maintain (i) a ratio of debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) of not more than   3.0   to 1.0 and (ii) a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than   4.0   to 1.0, each calculated as of the end of the applicable quarter on a rolling four quarters basis.  At   December 31, 2017  , the ratios of debt to consolidated EBITDA and consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement, were   1.3   to 1.0 and   14.8   to 1.0, respectively.  Altria Group, Inc. expects to continue to meet its covenants associated with the Credit Agreement.  The terms  consolidated EBITDA,   debt  and  consolidated interest expense,  as defined in the Credit Agreement, include certain adjustments.  Exhibit 99.3 to Altria Group, Inc. s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2013 sets forth the definitions of these terms as they appear in the Credit Agreement and is incorporated herein by reference. 
  Any commercial paper issued by Altria Group, Inc. and borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by PM USA as further discussed in   Note 19  .   Condensed Consolidating Financial Information   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (   Note 19   ). 
    Financial Market Environment   - Altria Group, Inc. believes it has adequate liquidity and access to financial resources to meet its anticipated obligations and ongoing business needs in the foreseeable future.  Altria Group, Inc. continues to monitor the credit quality of its bank group and is not aware of any potential non-performing credit provider in that group.  Altria Group, Inc. believes the lenders in its bank group will be willing and able to advance funds in accordance with their legal obligations. See Item

1A for certain risk factors associated with the foregoing discussion.  
    Tax Reform Act   - As a result of the Tax Reform Act s reduction in the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, Altria Group, Inc. expects increased liquidity.  Altria Group, Inc. plans to make strategic long-term investments with the increased liquidity, reinvesting approximately one-third of the total tax reform benefit in 2018, with a moderating level of investment in subsequent years. 
  Debt   - At   December 31, 2017   and   2016  , Altria Group, Inc. s total debt was   $13.9 billion   for each period.  

All of Altria Group, Inc. s debt was fixed-rate debt at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  .  The weighted-average coupon interest rate on total debt was approximately   4.9%   at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  .  For further details on long-term debt, see   Note 9  . 
  In October 2017, Altria Group, Inc. filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which Altria Group, Inc. may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
  Altria Group, Inc. has no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below. 
  Guarantees and Other Similar Matters   - As discussed in   Note 18  , Altria Group, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries had unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business, guarantees (including third-party guarantees) and a redeemable noncontrolling interest outstanding at December 31, 2017.  From time to time, subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities.  In addition, as discussed in   Note 19  , PM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria Group, Inc. s obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program.  These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria Group, Inc. s liquidity. 
  Aggregate Contractual Obligations   - The following table summarizes Altria Group, Inc. s contractual obligations at   December 31, 2017  : 

(1)    Amounts represent the expected cash payments of Altria Group, Inc. s long-term debt. 
   (2)    Amounts represent the expected cash payments of Altria Group, Inc. s interest expense on its long-term debt. Interest on Altria Group, Inc. s debt, which was all fixed-rate debt at   December 31, 2017  , is presented using the stated coupon interest rate.  Amounts exclude the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs, the amortization of loan fees and fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest and other debt expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. 
   (3)    Amounts represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. 
   (4)    Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business.  Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services.  Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction.  Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty, and with short notice (usually 30 days).  Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. 
   (5)    Other long-term liabilities consist of accrued postretirement health care costs and certain accrued pension costs.  The amounts included in the table above for accrued pension costs consist of the actuarially determined anticipated minimum funding requirements for each year from 2018 through 2022.  Contributions beyond 2022 cannot be reasonably estimated and, therefore, are not included in the table above.  In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued postemployment costs, income taxes and tax contingencies, and other accruals.  Altria Group, Inc. is unable to estimate the timing of payments for these items.

The State Settlement Agreements and related legal fee payments, and payments for FDA user fees, as discussed below and in   Note 18  , are excluded from the table above, as the payments are subject to adjustment for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume.  Litigation escrow deposits, as discussed below and in   Note 18  , are also excluded from the table above since these deposits will be returned to PM USA should it prevail on appeal.   
  Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation   - As discussed previously and in   Note 18  , PM USA and Nat Sherman have entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states and territories of the United States that call for certain payments.  In addition, PM USA, Middleton, Nat Sherman and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA.  Payments under the State Settlement Agreements and the FDA user fees are based on variable factors, such as volume, operating income, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment.  Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries account for the cost of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees as a component of cost of sales.  Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries recorded approximately $4.7 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees.

  Based on current agreements, 2017 market share and historical annual industry volume decline rates, the estimated amounts that Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees approximate $4.8 billion in 2018 and each year thereafter.  These amounts exclude the potential impact of the NPM Adjustment provision applicable under the MSA and the revised NPM Adjustment provisions applicable under the resolutions of the NPM Adjustment disputes. 
  The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year would generally be paid in the following year.  The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred.  As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer s market share.  The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. 
  Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments   - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of   December 31, 2017  , PM USA had posted various forms of security totaling approximately $61 million, the majority of which have been collateralized with cash deposits.  These cash deposits are included in assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 

Although litigation is subject to uncertainty and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations of PM USA, UST or Altria Group, Inc. in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in   Note 18  , Item 3 and Item 1A, management expects cash flow from operations, together with Altria Group, Inc. s access to capital markets, to provide sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing business needs. 
  Equity and Dividends 
  As discussed in   Note 11  .   Stock Plans   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, during   2017   Altria Group, Inc. granted an aggregate of   0.6 million   restricted stock units and 0.2 million performance stock units to eligible employees. 
  At   December 31, 2017  , the number of shares to be issued upon vesting of restricted stock units and performance stock units was not significant.  
  Dividends paid in   2017   and   2016   were approximately   $4.8 billion   and   $4.5 billion  , respectively, an increase of   6.5%  , reflecting a higher dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased by Altria Group, Inc. under its share repurchase program.   
  During the third quarter of   2017  , the Board of Directors approved an   8.2%   increase in the quarterly dividend rate to   $0.66   per share of Altria Group, Inc. common stock versus the previous rate of   $0.61   per share.  Altria Group, Inc. expects to continue to maintain a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of its adjusted diluted EPS.  The current annualized dividend rate is   $2.64   per share.  Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 
  At December 31,   2017  , Altria Group, Inc. had approximately   $18 million   remaining in the July 2015 share repurchase program, which it subsequently completed in January 2018.  In January 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which Altria Group, Inc. expects to complete by the end of 2018.  For further discussion of Altria Group, Inc. s share repurchase programs, see   Note 10  .   Capital Stock   to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 and Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted 
  See Note 2     for a discussion of recently issued accounting guidance applicable to, but not yet adopted by, Altria Group, Inc. 
  In addition, in February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-02,   Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income   ( ASU No. 2018-02 ).  Under ASU No. 2018-02, an entity may elect to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.  ASU No. 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim period for which

financial statements have not yet been issued.  The guidance in ASU No. 2018-02 should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate in the Tax Reform Act is recognized.  Altria Group, Inc. is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
  Contingencies 
  See   Note 18   and Item 3 for a discussion of contingencies. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  . 
  At   December 31, 2017   and   2016  , the fair value of Altria Group, Inc. s total debt was   $15.3 billion   and   $15.1 billion  , respectively.  The fair value of Altria Group, Inc. s debt is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in market interest rates.  A 1% increase in market interest rates at   December 31, 2017   and   2016   would decrease the fair value of Altria Group, Inc. s total debt by approximately $1.2 billion for each period.  A 1% decrease in market interest rates at   December 31, 2017   and   2016   would increase the fair value of Altria Group, Inc. s total debt by approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. 
  Interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement are expected to be based on LIBOR plus a percentage based on the higher of the ratings of Altria Group, Inc. s long-term senior unsecured debt from Moody s and Standard   Poor s.  The applicable percentage based on Altria Group, Inc. s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings at   December 31, 2017   for borrowings under the Credit Agreement was   1.125%  .  At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. had   no   borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

Note 1  .      Background and Basis of Presentation 
     Background:   At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. s  wholly-owned subsidiaries included Philip Morris USA Inc. ( PM USA ), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States; John Middleton Co. ( Middleton ), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA; Sherman Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries ( Nat Sherman ), which are engaged in the manufacture and sale of super premium cigarettes and the sale of premium cigars; and UST LLC ( UST ), which through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC ( USSTC ) and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. ( Ste. Michelle ), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless tobacco products and wine.  Altria Group, Inc. s other operating companies included Nu Mark LLC ( Nu Mark ), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is engaged in the manufacture and sale of innovative tobacco products, and Philip Morris Capital Corporation ( PMCC ), a wholly-owned subsidiary that maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases.  Other Altria Group, Inc. wholly-owned subsidiaries included Altria Group Distribution Company, which provides sales and distribution services to certain Altria Group, Inc. operating subsidiaries, and Altria Client Services LLC, which provides various support services in areas such as legal, regulatory, consumer engagement, finance, human resources and external affairs to Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Altria Group, Inc. s access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries.  At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests. 
  At September 30, 2016, Altria Group, Inc. had an approximate   27%   ownership of SABMiller plc ( SABMiller ), which Altria Group, Inc. accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  In   October 2016  , Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV ( Legacy AB InBev ) completed its business combination with SABMiller, and Altria Group, Inc. received cash and shares representing a   9.6%   ownership in the combined company (the  Transaction ).  The newly formed Belgian company, which retained the name Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV ( AB InBev ), became the holding company for the combined businesses.  Subsequently, Altria Group, Inc. purchased approximately   12 million   ordinary shares of AB InBev, increasing Altria Group, Inc. s ownership to approximately   10.2%   at December 31, 2016.  At December 31, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. had an approximate   10.2%   ownership of AB InBev, which Altria Group, Inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag.  As a result of the one-quarter lag and the timing of the completion of the Transaction,   no   earnings from Altria Group, Inc. s equity investment in AB InBev were recorded for the year  

ended December 31, 2016.  Altria Group, Inc. receives cash dividends on its interest in AB InBev if and when AB InBev pays such dividends.  For further discussion, see   Note 6  .   Investment in AB InBev/SABMiller  . 
  In January 2017, Altria Group, Inc. acquired Nat Sherman, which joined PM USA and Middleton as part of Altria Group, Inc. s smokeable products segment. 
     Basis of Presentation:   The consolidated financial statements include Altria Group, Inc., as well as its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries.  Investments in which Altria Group, Inc. has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions for goodwill and other intangible assets, marketing programs, income taxes, and the allowance for losses and estimated residual values of finance leases.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year s presentation due primarily to Altria Group, Inc. s 2017 adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  :   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU No. 2016-09 ).  For further discussion, see   Note 11  .   Stock Plans  .  
   
  Note 2  .  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     Cash and Cash Equivalents:   Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. 
     Depreciation, Amortization, Impairment Testing and Asset Valuation:   Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical costs and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to   25   years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to   50   years.  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to   25   years. 
  Altria Group, Inc. reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  Altria Group, Inc. performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.  For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Altria

     Table of Contents  
  Altria Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  _________________________ 

Group, Inc. groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.  If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.  Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.  Altria Group, Inc. also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed. 
  Altria Group, Inc. conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require Altria Group, Inc. to perform an interim review.  If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired.  The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value.  If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value.  
     Derivative Financial Instruments:   In November 2017, Altria Group, Inc. adopted ASU No. 2017-12,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)  :   Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities  , which expands hedge accounting for both financial and nonfinancial risk components to better portray the economic results of an entity s risk management activities in its financial statements.  In addition, the guidance includes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting.  At adoption, Altria Group, Inc. had   no   derivative or nonderivative financial instruments designated in hedging relationships.  Adoption of the guidance had   no   impact on prior years. 
  Altria Group, Inc. enters into derivatives to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk.  Altria Group, Inc. uses various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, options and swaps. 
  Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.  Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges at the inception of the contracts.  For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings each period.  For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded each period in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) and are reclassified to the consolidated statements of earnings in the same periods in which operating results are affected by the respective hedged item.  For net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign currency transaction gains or losses on a nonderivative hedging instrument are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to offset the change in the value  

of the net investment being hedged.  Such amounts remain in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying foreign operations occurs or, for investments in foreign entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting, Altria Group, Inc. s economic interest in the underlying foreign entity decreases.  Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the respective hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.   
  To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective at achieving the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated.  Altria Group, Inc. formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective, the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and method for assessing hedge effectiveness.  Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, if it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge will no longer be effective and all of the derivative gains and losses would be recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings in the current period.   
  For financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments or do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings each period.  Altria Group, Inc. does not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
     Employee Benefit Plans:   Altria Group, Inc. provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits.  Altria Group, Inc. records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. 
  Altria Group, Inc. recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.  The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years. 
     Environmental Costs:   Altria Group, Inc. is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Altria Group, Inc. provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. 
  Compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation and compliance costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had,

and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows (see   Note 18  .   Contingencies   -   Environmental Regulation  ). 
     Fair Value Measurements:   Altria Group, Inc. measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value.  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  Altria Group, Inc. uses a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are: 
           Level 1 
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
              Level 2 
    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
              Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
        Finance Leases:   Income attributable to leveraged leases is initially recorded as unearned income and subsequently recognized as revenue over the terms of the respective leases at constant after-tax rates of return on the positive net investment balances.  Investments in leveraged leases are stated net of related nonrecourse debt obligations. 
  Finance leases include unguaranteed residual values that represent PMCC s estimates at lease inception as to the fair values of assets under lease at the end of the non-cancelable lease terms.  The estimated residual values are reviewed at least annually by PMCC s management.  This review includes analysis of a number of factors, including activity in the relevant industry.  If necessary, revisions are recorded to reduce the residual values.  
  PMCC considers rents receivable past due when they are beyond the grace period of their contractual due date.  PMCC stops recording income ( non-accrual status ) on rents receivable when contractual payments become   90   days past due or earlier if management believes there is significant uncertainty of collectability of rent payments, and resumes recording income when collectability of rent payments is reasonably certain.  Payments received on rents receivable that are on non-accrual status are used to reduce the rents receivable balance.  Write-offs to the allowance for losses are recorded when amounts are deemed to be uncollectible. 
     Guarantees:   Altria Group, Inc. recognizes a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities.  See   Note 18  . Contingencies   for a further discussion of guarantees. 
     Income Taxes:   Significant judgment is required in  

determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. 
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Altria Group, Inc. records a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  
  Altria Group, Inc. recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.  The amount recognized is measured as   the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.    Altria Group, Inc. recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings. 
     Inventories:   The last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method is used to determine the cost of substantially all tobacco inventories.  The cost of the remaining inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) and average cost methods.  Inventories that are measured using the LIFO method are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Inventories that are measured using the FIFO and average cost methods are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco and wine inventories as current assets although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be used within   one year  . 
     Litigation Contingencies and Costs:   Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when it is determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings. 
     Marketing Costs:   Altria Group, Inc. s businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs, consumer incentives and trade promotions.  Such programs include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, event marketing and volume-based incentives.  Consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred.  Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues, a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period, based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates.  For interim reporting purposes, consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year. 
     Revenue Recognition:   Altria Group, Inc. s businesses recognize revenues, net of sales incentives and sales returns, and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to  

47 

     Table of Contents

  _________________________ 

customers.  Payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized.  Altria Group, Inc. s businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues.  Shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. 

Stock-Based Compensation:   Altria Group, Inc. measures compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognizes compensation expense over the service periods for awards expected to vest.  

New Accounting Standards:   The following table provides a description of the recently issued accounting guidance applicable to, but not yet adopted by, Altria Group, Inc.: 
                     Standards 
    Description 
    Effective Date for Public Entity 
    Effect on Financial Statements 
      ASU Nos. 2014-09; 2015-14; 2016-08; 2016-10; 2016-12; 2016-20  
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) 
    The guidance establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity s contracts with customers.   
    The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  
    The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the amount or timing of revenue recognized on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated financial statements based on current contracts with customers.  The guidance will result in expanded footnote disclosures.  Altria Group, Inc. will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. 
      ASU No. 2016-01 
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10) 
    The guidance addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.   
    The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  
    The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated financial statements.  Altria Group, Inc. will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018.  
      ASU Nos. 2016-02; 2018-01 
  Leases (Topic 842) 
    The guidance increases transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.   
    The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted. 
    Altria Group, Inc. is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including identifying and analyzing all contracts that contain a lease.  As a lessor, PMCC maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases, the accounting of which will be unchanged under the new guidance and is not expected to change unless there is a contract modification to an existing lease.  As a lessee, Altria Group, Inc. s various leases under existing guidance are classified as operating leases that are not recorded on its consolidated balance sheets but are recorded in its consolidated statements of earnings as expense is incurred.  Upon adoption of the new guidance, Altria Group, Inc. will record substantially all leases on its balance sheets as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated financial statements.  The guidance will result in expanded footnote disclosures.  
      ASU No. 2016-13   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments     (Topic 326) 
    
    The guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology for recognizing credit losses for financial assets with a methodology that reflects the entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information for estimating credit losses.   
    The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. 
    Altria Group, Inc. is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Altria Group, Inc. s financial assets that are within the scope of the new guidance were approximately 2% of Altria Group, Inc. s total assets at December 31, 2017.

    Effect on Financial Statements 
      ASU No. 2016-18    Restricted Cash (Topic 230) 
    
    The guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. 
    The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  
    At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Altria Group, Inc. had restricted cash of $61 million and $82 million, respectively.  Altria Group, Inc. will retrospectively adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 and will comply with the required presentation of restricted cash in its consolidated statements of cash flows upon adoption. 

ASU No. 2017-07   Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (Topic 715) 
    
    The guidance requires an employer to report the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period.  The other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost are required to be presented in the statement of earnings separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of operating income.  Additionally, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization. 
    The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within that reporting period.  The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the statement of earnings, and prospectively for the capitalization of the service cost component. 
    
    Under the new guidance, the amount of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost (income) presented within operating income that would have been presented separately from operating income was $37 million, $(1) million and $151 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The prospective adoption of this guidance related to the capitalization of the service cost component will not have a material impact on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated financial statements.  Altria Group, Inc. will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018. 

Note 3  .  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net 
  Goodwill and other intangible assets, net, by segment were as follows:   

  Goodwill relates to the 2017 acquisition of Nat Sherman, 2014 acquisition of Green Smoke, 2009 acquisition of UST and 2007 acquisition of Middleton. 
  Other intangible assets consisted of the following:  

Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist substantially of trademarks from Altria Group, Inc. s 2009 acquisition of UST (  $9.1 billion  ) and 2007 acquisition of Middleton (  $2.6 billion  ).  Definite-lived intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and certain cigarette trademarks, are amortized over periods up to   25   years.  Pre-tax amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets during each of the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , was   $21 million  .  Annual amortization expense for each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately   $20 million  , assuming no  

additional transactions occur that require the amortization of intangible assets.  
  During   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , Altria Group, Inc. completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and   no   impairment charges resulted.  
  For the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , there have been   no   changes in goodwill and the gross carrying amount of other intangible assets except for the purchase of certain intellectual property in 2017 primarily related to innovative tobacco products, the 2017 acquisition of Nat Sherman and Ste. Michelle s 2016 purchase of substantially all of the assets

of Patz   Hall Wine Company, Inc.  In addition, there were   no   accumulated impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, net at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  . 
   
  Note 4  .  Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs 
  Pre-tax asset impairment, exit and implementation costs consisted of the following:   

   (1)    The pre-tax implementation costs were included in cost of sales in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statement of earnings. 

(1)    Includes termination, settlement and curtailment costs of   $27 million  .  See   Note 16  .   Benefit Plans  . 
  The pre-tax asset impairment, exit and implementation costs for 2017 are related to the facilities consolidation discussed below, and the pre-tax asset impairment, exit and implementation costs for 2016 are related to both the facilities consolidation and the productivity initiative discussed below. 

The movement in the restructuring liabilities (excluding termination, settlement and curtailment costs), substantially all of which are severance liabilities, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows: 

Facilities Consolidation:   In October 2016, Altria Group, Inc. announced the consolidation of certain of its operating companies  manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies.  Middleton is in the process of transferring its Limerick, Pennsylvania operations to the Manufacturing Center site in Richmond, Virginia ( Richmond Manufacturing Center ).  USSTC is in the process of transferring its Franklin Park, Illinois operations to its Nashville, Tennessee facility and the Richmond Manufacturing Center.  Separation benefits are being paid to non-relocating employees.  The consolidation is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018.  
  As a result of the consolidation, Altria Group, Inc. expects to record total pre-tax charges of approximately   $150 million  , or   $0.05   per share.  Of this amount, during 2017, Altria Group, Inc. incurred pre-tax charges of   $78 million   and recorded   $71 million   in 2016.  The total estimated charges relate primarily to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment (  $50 million  ), employee separation costs (  $45 million  ) and other exit and implementation costs (  $55 million  ).  Approximately   $95 million   of the total pre-tax charges are expected to result in cash expenditures. 
  For the year ended December 31, 2016, total pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs for the consolidation of   $54 million   were recorded in the smokeable products segment (  $25 million  ) and smokeless products segment (  $29 million  ).  In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2016, pre-tax implementation costs of   $17 million   were recorded in the smokeable products segment (  $3 million  ) and smokeless products segment (  $14 million  ).   The pre-tax implementation costs were included in cost of sales in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statement of earnings. 
  Cash payments related to the consolidation of   $58 million   were made during the year ended December 31, 2017, for total cash payments of   $63 million   since inception.  
     Productivity Initiative:   In January 2016,     Altria Group, Inc. announced a productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating companies  leadership and cost competitiveness through reduced spending on certain selling, general and administrative infrastructure and a leaner organizational structure.  As a result of the initiative, during 2016, Altria Group, Inc. incurred total pre- 

50 

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  _________________________ 

tax restructuring charges of   $132 million  , or   $0.04   per share, substantially all of which result in cash expenditures.  The charges consisted of employee separation costs of   $117 million   and other associated costs of   $15 million  .  Total pre-tax charges related to the initiative have been completed.  
  For the year ended December 31, 2016, total pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs for the initiative of   $125 million   were recorded in the smokeable products segment (  $100 million  ), smokeless products segment (  $13 million  ), all other (  $7 million  ) and general corporate (  $5 million  ).  In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2016, pre-tax implementation costs of   $7 million   were recorded in the smokeable products segment (  $6 million  ) and smokeless products segment (  $1 million  ).  The pre-tax implementation costs were included in marketing, administration and research costs in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statement of earnings. 
  Cash payments related to the initiative of   $32 million   were made during the year ended December 31, 2017, for total cash payments of   $106 million   since inception. 
   
  Note 5  .  Inventories  
  On January 1, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. adopted ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory     (Topic 330)  :   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , which requires inventory that is measured using the FIFO or average cost methods to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Previous guidance required inventory that was measured using the FIFO or average cost methods to be measured at the lower of cost or market.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated financial statements.  
  The cost of approximately   59%   and   62%   of inventories at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively, was determined using the LIFO method.  The stated LIFO amounts of inventories were approximately   $0.7 billion   lower than the current cost of inventories at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  . 
   
  Note 6  .    Investment in AB InBev/SABMiller     
  At December 31, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. had an approximate   10.2%   ownership of AB InBev, consisting of approximately   185 million   restricted shares of AB InBev (the  Restricted Shares ) and approximately   12 million   ordinary shares of AB InBev.  Altria Group, Inc. accounts for its investment in AB InBev under the equity method of accounting because Altria Group, Inc. has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of AB InBev, including having active representation on AB InBev s Board of Directors ( AB InBev Board ) and certain AB InBev Board Committees.  Through this representation, Altria Group, Inc. participates in AB InBev policy making processes.   
  Altria Group, Inc. reports its share of AB InBev s results using a one-quarter lag because AB InBev s results are not available in time for Altria Group, Inc. to record them in the concurrent period. 
  Pre-tax earnings from Altria Group, Inc. s equity investment in AB InBev were   $532 million   for the year ended December 31, 2017.  As a result of the one-quarter lag and the timing of the  

completion of the Transaction,   no   earnings from Altria Group, Inc. s equity investment in AB InBev were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Tax Reform Act ).  Consistent with the one-quarter lag for recording AB InBev s results, in the first quarter of 2018 Altria Group, Inc. will record its share of AB InBev s recorded fourth quarter 2017 estimated effect of the Tax Reform Act. 
  Summary financial data of AB InBev is as follows:   

(1)    Reflecting the one-quarter lag: (i) summary financial data of AB InBev s results for Altria Group, Inc. s year ended December 31, 2017 include AB InBev s results for the last three months of 2016 and the first nine months of 2017, and (ii) summary financial data of AB InBev s financial position is disclosed at September 30, 2017 and October 10, 2016. 
  At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. s carrying amount of its equity investment in AB InBev exceeded its share of AB InBev s net assets attributable to equity holders of AB InBev by approximately   $11.7 billion  .  Substantially all of this difference is comprised of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (consisting primarily of trademarks). 
   The fair value of Altria Group, Inc. s equity investment in AB InBev is based on: (i) unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for AB InBev s ordinary shares and was classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy and (ii) observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets for the Restricted Shares, and was classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Altria Group, Inc. may, in certain instances, pledge or otherwise grant a security interest in all or part of its Restricted Shares.  In the event the pledgee or security interest holder forecloses on the Restricted Shares, the relevant Restricted Shares will be automatically converted, one-for-one, into ordinary shares.  Therefore, the fair value of each Restricted Share is based on the value of an ordinary share.  The fair value of Altria Group, Inc. s equity investment in AB InBev at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was   $22.1 billion   and   $20.9 billion  , respectively, compared

with its carrying value of   $18.0 billion   and   $17.9 billion  , respectively.    
  Prior to the completion of the Transaction on October 10, 2016, Altria Group, Inc. held an approximate   27%   ownership of SABMiller that was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
  Pre-tax earnings from Altria Group, Inc. s equity investment in SABMiller were   $795 million   and   $757 million   for the years ended December 31,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Altria Group, Inc. s earnings from its equity investment in SABMiller for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a pre-tax non-cash gain of   $309 million  , reflecting Altria Group, Inc. s share of SABMiller s increase to shareholders  equity, resulting from the completion of the SABMiller, The Coca-Cola Company and Gutsche Family Investments transaction, combining bottling operations in Africa.  As a result of the timing of the completion of the Transaction, Altria Group, Inc. s pre-tax earnings from its equity investment in SABMiller for the year ended December 31, 2016 included its share of approximately nine months of SABMiller s earnings. 
       Summary financial data of SABMiller is as follows:   
   
   (1)    As a result of the timing of the completion of the Transaction, summary financial data of SABMiller for the year ended December 31, 2016 included approximately nine months of SABMiller s results. 
     AB InBev and SABMiller Business Combination:   On October 10, 2016, Legacy AB InBev completed the Transaction, and AB InBev became the holding company for the combined SABMiller and Legacy AB InBev businesses.  Under the terms of the Transaction, SABMiller shareholders received   45   British pounds ( GBP ) in cash for each SABMiller share held, with a partial share alternative ( PSA ), which was subject to proration, available for approximately   41%   of the SABMiller shares.  Altria Group, Inc. elected the PSA.   
  Upon completion of the Transaction and taking into account proration, Altria Group, Inc. received, in respect of its   430,000,000   SABMiller shares, (i) an interest that was converted into the Restricted Shares, representing a   9.6%   ownership of AB InBev based on AB InBev s shares outstanding at October 10, 2016, and (ii) approximately   $4.8 billion   in pre-tax cash as the cash component of the PSA.  Additionally, Altria Group, Inc. received pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately   $0.5 billion   from exercising the derivative financial instruments discussed below, which, together with the pre-tax cash from the Transaction, totaled approximately   $5.3 billion   in pre-tax cash.  Subsequently, Altria Group, Inc. purchased approximately   12 million   ordinary shares of AB InBev for a total cost of approximately   $1.6 billion  , thereby increasing Altria Group, Inc. s ownership of AB InBev to approximately   10.2%   at December 31, 2016.  

The Restricted Shares: 
             
    are unlisted and not admitted to trading on any stock exchange; 
                
    are subject to a   five  -year lock-up (subject to limited exceptions) ending October 10, 2021;  
                
    are convertible into ordinary shares of AB InBev on a one-for-one basis after the end of this   five  -year lock-up period; 
                
    rank equally with ordinary shares of AB InBev with regards to dividends and voting rights; and 
                
    have director nomination rights with respect to AB InBev.  
     As a result of the Transaction, for the year ended December 31, 2016, Altria Group, Inc. recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately   $13.9 billion  , or   $9.0 billion   after-tax, which was based on the following: 
              
    the book value of Altria Group, Inc. s investment in SABMiller, including Altria Group, Inc. s accumulated other comprehensive losses directly attributable to SABMiller, at October 10, 2016;  
                
    the gains on the derivative financial instruments discussed below; and 
                
    the impact of AB InBev s divestitures of certain SABMiller assets and businesses in connection with Legacy AB InBev obtaining necessary regulatory clearances for the Transaction ( AB InBev divestitures ) that occurred by December 31, 2016. 
     For the year ended December 31, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. recorded pre-tax gains of   $445 million   related to the planned completion of the remaining AB InBev divestitures in gain on AB InBev/SABMiller business combination in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statement of earnings. 
  Altria Group, Inc. s gain on the Transaction was deferred for United States corporate income tax purposes, except to the extent of the cash consideration received.  
         Derivative Financial Instruments:   In November 2015 and August 2016, Altria Group, Inc. entered into a derivative financial instrument, each in the form of a put option (together the  options ) to hedge Altria Group, Inc. s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements in the GBP to the United States dollar, in relation to the pre-tax cash consideration that Altria Group, Inc. expected to receive under the PSA pursuant to the revised and final offer announced by Legacy AB InBev on July 26, 2016.  The notional amounts of the November 2015 and August 2016 options were   $2,467 million   (  1,625 million   GBP) and   $480 million   (  378 million   GBP), respectively.  The options did not qualify for hedge accounting; therefore, changes in the fair values of the options were recorded as gains or losses in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statements of earnings in the periods in which the changes occurred.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, Altria Group, Inc. recorded pre-tax gains associated with the November 2015 and August  

52

2016 options of   $330 million   and   $19 million  , respectively, for the changes in the fair values of the options in gain on AB InBev/SABMiller business combination in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statement of earnings.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, Altria Group, Inc. recorded a pre-tax gain of   $20 million   for the change in the fair value of the November 2015 option.  Exercising the options in October 2016 resulted in approximately   $0.5 billion   in pre-tax cash proceeds.  
  The fair values of the options were determined using binomial option pricing models, which reflect the contractual terms of the options and other observable market-based inputs, and were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
   
  Note 7  .  Finance Assets, net 
  In 2003, PMCC ceased making new investments and began focusing exclusively on managing its portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize its operating results and cash flows from its existing lease portfolio activities and asset sales.  Accordingly, PMCC s operating companies income will fluctuate over time as investments mature or are sold.   
       At   December 31, 2017  , finance assets, net, of   $899 million   were comprised of investments in finance leases of $  922 million  , reduced by the allowance for losses of   $23 million  .  At   December 31, 2016  , finance assets, net, of   $1,028 million   were comprised of investments in finance leases of   $1,060 million  , reduced by the allowance for losses of   $32 million  . 
  A summary of the net investments in finance leases, substantially all of which were leveraged leases, at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  , before allowance for losses was as follows:   

  Rents receivable, net, represent unpaid rents, net of principal and interest payments on third-party nonrecourse debt.  PMCC s rights to rents receivable are subordinate to the third-party nonrecourse debtholders and the leased equipment is pledged as collateral to the debtholders.  The repayment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property, and is nonrecourse to the general assets of PMCC.  As required by U.S. GAAP, the third-party nonrecourse debt of   $0.6 billion   and   $0.8 billion   at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively, has been offset against the related rents receivable.  There were   no   leases with contingent rentals in   2017   and   2016  . 
   In   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   PMCC s review of estimated residual values resulted in a decrease of   $8 million  ,   $28 million   and   $65 million  , respectively, to unguaranteed residual values.  These decreases in unguaranteed residual values resulted in a  

reduction to PMCC s net revenues of   $5 million  ,   $18 million   and   $41 million   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  At   December 31, 2017  , PMCC s investments in finance leases were principally comprised of the following investment categories: aircraft (  40%  ), electric power (  27%  ), railcar (  13%  ), real estate (  10%  ) and manufacturing (  10%  ).  There were   no   investments located outside the United States at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  .   
  Rents receivable in excess of debt service requirements on third-party nonrecourse debt at   December 31, 2017   were as follows: 

PMCC maintains an allowance for losses that provides for estimated credit losses on its investments in finance leases.  PMCC s portfolio consists substantially of leveraged leases to a diverse base of lessees participating in a variety of industries.  Losses on such leases are recorded when probable and estimable.  PMCC regularly performs a systematic assessment of each individual lease in its portfolio to determine potential credit or collection issues that might indicate impairment.  Impairment takes into consideration both the probability of default and the likelihood of recovery if default were to occur.  PMCC considers both quantitative and qualitative factors of each investment when performing its assessment of the allowance for losses. 
  Quantitative factors that indicate potential default are tied most directly to public debt ratings.  PMCC monitors publicly available information on its obligors, including financial statements and credit rating agency reports.  Qualitative factors that indicate the likelihood of recovery if default were to occur include underlying collateral value, other forms of credit support, and legal/structural considerations impacting each lease.  Using available information, PMCC calculates potential losses for each lease in its portfolio based on its default and recovery rating assumptions for each lease.  The aggregate of these potential losses forms a range of potential losses which is used as a guideline to determine the adequacy of PMCC s allowance for losses. 
  PMCC assesses the adequacy of its allowance for losses relative to the credit risk of its leasing portfolio on an ongoing basis.  During   2017   and   2016  , PMCC determined that its allowance for losses exceeded the amount required based on management s assessment of the credit quality and size of PMCC s leasing portfolio.  As a result, PMCC reduced its allowance for losses by   $9 million   and   $10 million   for the years ended December 31,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  There was   no   such adjustment for the year ended December 31,   2015  .  These

decreases to the allowance for losses were recorded as a reduction to marketing, administration and research costs in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statements of earnings.  PMCC believes that, as of   December 31, 2017  , the allowance for losses of   $23 million   was adequate.  PMCC continues to monitor economic and credit conditions, and the individual situations of its lessees and their respective industries, and may increase or decrease its allowance for losses if such conditions change in the future.  
  The activity in the allowance for losses on finance assets for the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was as follows: 

All   PMCC lessees were current on their lease payment obligations as of   December 31, 2017  . 
  The credit quality of PMCC s investments in finance leases as assigned by Standard   Poor s Ratings Services ( Standard   Poor s ) and Moody s Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody s ) at   December 31, 2017   and   2016   was as follows: 

Note 8  .  Short-Term Borrowings and Borrowing Arrangements 
  At   December 31, 2017   and   December 31, 2016  , Altria Group, Inc. had   no   short-term borrowings.  The credit line available to Altria Group, Inc. at   December 31, 2017   under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) was   $3.0 billion  . 
  At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. had in place a senior unsecured   5  -year revolving credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ).  The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of   $3.0 billion   and expires on August 19, 2020.  Pricing for interest and fees under the Credit Agreement may be modified in the event of a change in the rating of Altria Group, Inc. s long-term senior unsecured debt.  Interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement are expected to be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a percentage based on the higher of the ratings of Altria Group, Inc. s long-term senior unsecured debt from Moody s and Standard   Poor s.  The applicable percentage based on Altria Group, Inc. s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings at   December 31, 2017   for borrowings under the Credit Agreement was   1.125%  .  The Credit Agreement does not include any other rating triggers, nor does it contain any provisions that could require the posting of collateral.   
  The Credit Agreement is used for general corporate purposes and to support Altria Group, Inc. s commercial paper issuances.   

The Credit Agreement requires that Altria Group, Inc. maintain (i) a ratio of debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) of not more than   3.0   to 1.0 and (ii) a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than   4.0   to 1.0, each calculated as of the end of the applicable quarter on a rolling four quarters basis.  At   December 31, 2017  , the ratios of debt to consolidated EBITDA and consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement, were   1.3   to 1.0 and   14.8   to 1.0, respectively.  Altria Group, Inc. expects to continue to meet its covenants associated with the Credit Agreement.  The terms  consolidated EBITDA,   debt  and  consolidated interest expense,  as defined in the Credit Agreement, include certain adjustments.

At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. had approximately   $18 million   remaining in the July 2015 share repurchase program.

  For the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , Altria Group, Inc. s total share repurchase activity was as follows: 

Note 11  .  Stock Plans 
  Under the Altria Group, Inc. 2015 Performance Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ), Altria Group, Inc. may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted and deferred stock units, and other stock-based awards, as well as cash-based annual and long-term incentive awards to employees of Altria Group, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.  Any awards granted pursuant to the 2015 Plan may be in the form of performance-based awards subject to the achievement or satisfaction of performance goals and performance cycles.  Up to   40 million   shares of common stock may be issued under the 2015 Plan.  In addition, under the 2015 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the  Directors Plan ), Altria Group, Inc. may grant up to   one million   shares of common stock to members of the Board of Directors who are not employees of Altria Group, Inc. 
  Shares available to be granted under the 2015 Plan and the Directors Plan at   December 31, 2017  , were   38,161,242   and   920,942  , respectively. 
  On January 1, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. adopted ASU No. 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 did not have a material impact on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated financial statements.  The portions of the guidance that have an impact on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated financial statements have been adopted prospectively, with the exception of the classification of employee 

taxes paid by Altria Group, Inc. on the consolidated statements of cash flows related to shares withheld by Altria Group, Inc. for tax withholding purposes, which has been applied retrospectively.  Altria Group, Inc. has made an accounting policy election to continue to estimate the number of share-based awards that are expected to vest, which includes estimating forfeitures.     
     Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units:   Altria Group, Inc. may grant shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees of Altria Group, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.  During the vesting period, these shares include nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents and may not be sold, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered.  Such shares are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met.  Altria Group, Inc. estimates the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjusts this estimate when subsequent information indicates that the actual number of forfeitures is likely to differ from previous estimates.  Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units generally vest   three years   after the grant date. 
  The fair value of the shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures, is amortized to expense ratably over the restriction period, which is generally   three years  .  Altria Group, Inc. recorded pre-tax compensation expense related to restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to employees for the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015   of   $49 million  ,   $44 million   and   $51 million  , respectively.  The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was   $18 million  ,   $17 million   and   $20 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The unamortized compensation expense related to Altria Group, Inc. restricted stock and restricted stock units was   $54 million   at   December 31, 2017   and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   two years  . 
  Altria Group, Inc. s restricted stock and restricted stock units activity was as follows for the year ended   December 31, 2017  :   

  The weighted-average grant date fair value of Altria Group, Inc. restricted stock and restricted stock units granted during the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was   $46 million  ,   $56 million   and   $65 million  , respectively, or   $71.05  ,   $59.38   and   $54.54   per restricted stock or restricted stock unit, respectively.  The total fair value of Altria Group, Inc. restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was   $95 million  ,   $78 million   and   $85 million  , respectively.

Performance Stock Units:   In January 2017, Altria Group, Inc. granted an aggregate of   187,886   performance stock units to eligible employees.  The payout of the performance stock units requires the achievement of certain performance measures, which were predetermined at the time of grant, over a   three  -year performance cycle.  These performance measures consist of Altria Group, Inc. s adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) compounded annual growth rate and Altria Group, Inc. s total shareholder return relative to a predetermined peer group.  The performance stock units are also subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met.  At December 31, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. had   170,755   performance stock units remaining, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $70.39   per performance stock unit.  The fair value of the performance stock units at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures, is amortized to expense over the performance period.  Altria Group, Inc. recorded pre-tax compensation expense related to performance stock units for the year ended   December 31, 2017   of   $6 million  .  The unamortized compensation expense related to Altria Group, Inc. s performance stock units was   $7 million   at   December 31, 2017  .  Altria Group, Inc. did   no  t grant any performance stock units during   2016   and   2015  .

(1)     Altria Group, Inc. s proportionate share of AB InBev s and SABMiller s other comprehensive earnings/losses consisted primarily of currency translation adjustments for the years ended December 31,   2017   and   2015  , respectively. 
   (2)     As a result of the Transaction, Altria Group, Inc. reversed to investment in SABMiller   $414 million   of its accumulated other comprehensive losses directly attributable to SABMiller; the remaining   $97 million   consisted primarily of currency translation adjustments.

(    1)     Amounts are included in net defined benefit plan costs.  For further details, see   Note 16  .   Benefit Plans. 
   (2)     For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015, amounts are included in earnings from equity investment in AB InBev/SABMiller.

Investment in AB InBev/SABMiller. 
   
  Note 14  .  Income Taxes 
    As a result of the Tax Reform Act, Altria Group, Inc. recorded net tax benefits of approximately   $3.4 billion   in the fourth quarter of 2017 as discussed below.  The main provisions of the Tax Reform Act that impact Altria Group, Inc. include: (i) a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from   35%   to   21%   effective January 1, 2018, and (ii) changes in the treatment of foreign-source income, commonly referred to as a modified territorial tax system.  
  The transition to a modified territorial tax system requires Altria Group, Inc. to record a deemed repatriation tax and an associated tax basis benefit in 2017.  Substantially all of the deemed repatriation tax is related to Altria Group, Inc. s share of AB InBev s accumulated earnings.  As a result of the deemed repatriation tax,   no   tax was due on the dividends Altria Group, Inc. received from AB InBev in 2017. 

Earnings before income taxes and (benefit) provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  :    

Altria Group, Inc. s U.S. subsidiaries join in the filing of a U.S. federal consolidated income tax return.  The U.S. federal income tax statute of limitations remains open for the year 2010 and forward, with years 2014 and 2015 currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) as part of an audit conducted in the ordinary course of business.  With the exception of corresponding federal audit adjustments, state statutes of limitations generally remain open for the year 2013 and forward.  Certain of Altria Group, Inc. s state tax returns are currently under examination by various states as part of routine audits conducted in the ordinary course of business.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was as follows:    

Unrecognized tax benefits and Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated liability for tax contingencies at   December 31, 2017   and   2016   were as follows:   

  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate at   December 31, 2017   was   $43 million  , along with   $23 million   affecting deferred taxes.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate at   December 31, 2016   was   $67 million  , along with   $102 million   affecting deferred taxes. 
  Altria Group, Inc. recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.   
  For the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , Altria Group, Inc. recognized in its consolidated statements of earnings   $(13) million  ,   $9 million   and   $(36) million  , respectively, of gross interest (income) expense associated with uncertain tax positions. 
  Altria Group, Inc. is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions.  Uncertain tax positions reflect the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax returns and the amounts recognized in the financial statements.  Resolution of the related tax positions with the relevant tax authorities may take many years to complete, and such timing is not entirely within the control of Altria Group, Inc.  It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain examinations will be resolved, which could result in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately   $5 million  . 
  The effective income tax rate on pre-tax earnings differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the following reasons for the years ended   December 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  : 

The tax benefit in 2017 included net tax benefits of   $3,367 million   related to the Tax Reform Act recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 as follows: (i) a tax benefit of   $3,017 million   to re-measure Altria Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries  net deferred tax liabilities based on the new U.S. federal statutory rate; and (ii) a net tax benefit of   $763 million   for a tax basis adjustment associated with the deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by tax expense of   $413 million   for the deemed repatriation tax.  
  The amounts above related to the tax basis adjustment and the deemed repatriation tax were based on provisional estimates as of January 18, 2018, substantially all of which are related to Altria Group, Inc. s share of AB InBev s accumulated earnings and associated taxes.  Altria Group, Inc. may be required to adjust these provisional estimates based on (i) additional guidance related to, or interpretation of, the Tax Reform Act and associated tax laws and (ii) additional information to be received from AB InBev, including information regarding AB InBev s accumulated earnings and associated taxes for the 2016 and 2017 tax years.  This additional guidance and information could result in increases or decreases to the provisional estimates, which may be significant in relation to these estimates.  Altria Group, Inc. will record any such adjustments in 2018.  
  The tax benefit in 2017 also included tax benefits of   $232 million   for the release of a valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2017 related to deferred income tax assets for foreign tax credit carryforwards, which is included in AB InBev/SABMiller dividend benefit in the table above; and tax benefits of   $152 million   related primarily to the effective settlement in the second quarter of 2017 of the IRS audit of Altria Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries  2010-2013 tax years, partially offset by tax expense of   $114 million   in the third quarter of 2017 for tax reserves related to the calculation of certain foreign tax credits.   
  The tax provision in 2016 included increased tax benefits associated with the cumulative SABMiller and AB InBev dividends and tax expense of   $4.9 billion   (approximately   35%  ) for the gain on the Transaction. 

60 

     Table of Contents  
  Altria Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  _________________________ 

The tax provision in 2015 included net tax benefits of (i)   $59 million   from the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest due primarily to the closure in the third quarter of 2015 of the IRS audit of Altria Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries  2007-2009 tax years ( IRS 2007-2009 Audit  and (ii)   $41 million   for Philip Morris International Inc. ( PMI ) tax matters discussed below, partially offset by the reversal of foreign tax credits primarily associated with SABMiller dividends that were recorded during the third quarter of 2015 (  $41 million  ) and the fourth quarter of 2015 (  $24 million  ). The tax provision in 2015 also included decreased recognition of foreign tax credits associated with SABMiller dividends. 
  Under tax sharing agreements between Altria Group, Inc. and its former subsidiary PMI, entered into in connection with the 2008 spin-off, PMI is responsible for its pre-spin-off tax obligations.  Altria Group, Inc., however, remained severally liable for PMI s pre-spin-off federal tax obligations pursuant to regulations governing federal consolidated income tax returns, and continued to include the pre-spin-off federal income tax reserves of PMI in its liability for uncertain tax positions.  As of December 31, 2015, there were   no   remaining pre-spin-off tax reserves for PMI.  
  During   2015  , Altria Group, Inc. recorded tax benefits of   $41 million   for PMI tax matters, primarily relating to the IRS 2007-2009 Audit.  These net tax benefits were offset by a reduction of a PMI tax-related receivable, which was recorded as a decrease to operating income in Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statement of earnings.  Due to the offset, the PMI tax matters had   no   impact on Altria Group, Inc. s net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  : 

At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. had estimated gross state tax net operating losses of   $569 million   that, if unused, will expire in   2018   through   2037  . 
   
  Note 15  .  Segment Reporting

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the NPM Adjustment Items primarily relate to the resolution of the dispute with New York.  For further discussion, see   Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes   in   Note 18  .   Contingencies.    The amounts shown in the table above for the smokeable products segment were recorded by PM USA as increases (reductions) to cost of sales, which decreased (increased) operating companies income in the smokeable products segment.

USSTC estimates that the Recall reduced smokeless products segment operating companies income by approximately   $60 million   in 2017.  
     Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs:   See   Note 4  .   Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs   for a breakdown of these costs by segment.  
   
  Note 16  .  Benefit Plans 
  Subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of all employees of Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  However, employees hired on or after a date specific to their employee group are not eligible to participate in these noncontributory defined benefit pension plans but are instead eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan with enhanced benefits.  This transition for new hires occurred from October 1, 2006 to January 1, 2008.  In addition, effective January 1, 2010, certain employees of UST s subsidiaries and Middleton who were participants in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans ceased to earn additional benefit service under those plans and became eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan with enhanced benefits.  Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries also provide postretirement health care and other benefits to the majority of retired employees. 
  The plan assets and benefit obligations of Altria Group, Inc. s pension plans and postretirement plans are measured at December 31 of each year.  In December 2017, Altria Group, Inc. made a contribution of   $270 million   to a trust to fund certain

postretirement benefits.  Prior to this contribution, Altria Group, Inc. s postretirement plans were not funded.   
  The discount rates for Altria Group, Inc. s plans were based on a yield curve developed from a model portfolio of high-quality  

corporate bonds with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations. 

Obligations and Funded Status:   The benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of Altria Group, Inc. s pension and postretirement plans at   December 31, 2017   and   2016   were as follows: 

The table above presents the projected benefit obligation for Altria Group, Inc. s pension plans.  The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to date, for the pension plans was   $8.2 billion   and $  8.0 billion   at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively. 
  For plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31,   2017  , the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $  413 million  , $  364 million   and $  124 million  , respectively.  At December 31,   2016  , the accumulated benefit obligations were in excess of plan assets for all pension plans. 
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, mandates health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2022, including the imposition of an excise tax on high cost health care plans effective in 2022.  The  

additional accumulated postretirement liability resulting from the PPACA, which is not material to Altria Group, Inc., has been included in Altria Group, Inc. s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  .  Given the complexity of the PPACA and the extended time period during which implementation is expected to occur, future adjustments to Altria Group, Inc. s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation may be necessary. 
  The following assumptions were used to determine Altria Group, Inc. s pension benefit obligations at December 31:

The following assumptions were used to determine Altria Group, Inc. s postretirement benefit obligations at December 31:   

Termination, settlement and curtailment shown in the table above primarily relate to the settlement charge discussed below, and the productivity initiative and facilities consolidation discussed in   Note 4  .   Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs  . 
  In the third quarter of 2017, Altria Group, Inc. made a voluntary, limited-time offer to former employees with vested benefits in the Altria Retirement Plan who had not commenced receiving benefit payments and who met certain other conditions.  Eligible participants were offered the opportunity to make a one-time election to receive their pension benefit as a single lump sum payment or as a monthly annuity.  Distributions to former employees who elected to receive lump sum payments totaled approximately   $277 million  , substantially all of which were made in December 2017 from the Altria Retirement Plan s assets.  Payments began on January 1, 2018 to former employees who elected a monthly annuity.  As a result of the lump sum distributions, Altria Group, Inc. recorded a one-time settlement charge of   $81 million   in 2017. 
  The amounts included in termination, settlement and curtailment in the table above were comprised of the following changes: 

Beginning in 2016, Altria Group, Inc. began using a spot rate approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as Altria Group, Inc. believes that this approach is a more precise estimate of service and interest cost.  This change resulted in a decrease of approximately   $70 million   and   $20 million   to its 2016 pre-tax pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost, respectively.  Prior to 2016, Altria Group, Inc. estimated the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the pension and postretirement plans benefit obligations. 
  The estimated net loss and prior service cost (credit) that are expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive losses into net periodic benefit cost during 2018 is as follows:

The following assumptions were used to determine Altria Group, Inc. s net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31:   

    Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement health care plans.  A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects as of   December 31, 2017  :

Defined Contribution Plans:   Altria Group, Inc. sponsors deferred profit-sharing plans covering certain salaried, non-union and union employees.  Contributions and costs are determined generally as a percentage of earnings, as defined by the plans.  Amounts charged to expense for these defined contribution plans totaled   $83 million  ,   $93 million   and   $85 million   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
     Pension Plan Assets:   Altria Group, Inc. s investment strategy for its pension plan assets is based on an expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term.  Altria Group, Inc. believes that it implements the investment strategy in a prudent and risk-controlled manner, consistent with the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, by investing retirement plan assets in a well-diversified mix of equities, fixed income and other securities that reflects the impact of the demographic mix of plan participants on the benefit obligation using a target asset allocation between equity securities and fixed income investments of   55%  /  45%  .  The composition of Altria Group, Inc. s plan assets at   December 31, 2017   was broadly characterized as an allocation between equity securities (  59%  ), corporate bonds (  30%  ) and U.S.  Treasury and foreign government securities (  11%  ).  Virtually all pension assets can be used to make monthly benefit payments. 

Altria Group, Inc. s investment objective for its pension plan assets is accomplished by investing in U.S. and international equity index strategies that are intended to mirror indices such as the Standard   Poor s 500 Index, Russell Small Cap Completeness Index, Research Affiliates Fundamental Index ( RAFI ) Low Volatility U.S. Index, and Morgan Stanley Capital International ( MSCI ) Europe, Australasia, and the Far East ( EAFE ) Index.  Altria Group, Inc. s pension plans also invest in actively managed international equity securities of large, mid and small cap companies located in developed and emerging markets, as well as long duration fixed income securities that primarily include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries.  The allocation to below investment grade securities represented   16%   of the fixed income holdings or   7%   of total plan assets at   December 31, 2017  .  The allocation to emerging markets represented   4%   of the equity holdings or   3%   of total plan assets at   December 31, 2017  .  
  Altria Group, Inc. s risk management practices for its pension plans include ongoing monitoring of asset allocation, investment performance and investment managers  compliance with their investment guidelines, periodic rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes and annual actuarial re-measurement of plan liabilities. 
  Altria Group, Inc. s expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined by the plan assets  historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.  The forward-looking estimates are consistent with the overall long-term averages exhibited by returns on equity and fixed income securities.  Altria Group, Inc. has reduced this assumption from   8.0%   to   7.8%   for determining its pension net periodic benefit cost for 2018.

The fair values of Altria Group, Inc. s pension plan assets by asset category at   December 31, 2017   and   2016   were as follows: 

Level 3 holdings and transactions were immaterial to total plan assets at   December 31, 2017   and   2016  . 
    
    For a description of the fair value hierarchy and the three         levels of inputs used to measure fair value, see   Note 2  .   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  . 
  Following is a description of the valuation methodologies          used for investments measured at fair value. 
             
    U.S. and Foreign Government Securities  : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities.  Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes.  Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available. 
                
    Corporate Debt Instruments  : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes.  Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available. 
                
    Common Stock  : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date. 
                
    Common/Collective Trusts  : Common/collective trusts consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard   Poor s 500 Index, Russell Small Cap Completeness Index and MSCI EAFE Index.  They are  

valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective common/collective trusts.  The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ( NAV ), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.  
     Postretirement Plan Assets:   Altria Group, Inc. has established a long-term investment strategy for its postretirement plan assets using a target asset allocation between equity securities and fixed income investments of   55%  /  45%  .  The expected rate of return on plan assets is   7.8%   for determining Altria Group, Inc. s postretirement net periodic benefit cost for 2018.  At   December 31, 2017  , postretirement plan assets totaled   $270 million  .  Approximately   $150 million   was invested in domestic and international common/collective trusts.  The underlying assets of each of the respective common/collective trusts are valued based on the NAV, which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value.  Additionally, approximately   $120 million   was held in an interest bearing cash account, which is classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, pending full implementation of the investment strategy in early January 2018. 
     Cash Flows:   Altria Group, Inc. makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax

deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations.  Currently, Altria Group, Inc. anticipates making employer contributions to its pension plans of up to approximately $  60 million   in 2018 based on current tax law.  However, this estimate is subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, or  

changes in interest rates.  In December 2017, Altria Group, Inc. made a contribution of   $270 million   to its postretirement plans.  Currently, Altria Group, Inc. anticipates making employer contributions to its postretirement plans of up to approximately   $70 million   in 2018.  However, this estimate is subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return on postretirement plan assets. 

Estimated future benefit payments at   December 31, 2017   were as follows:

Note 18  . Contingencies 
  Legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including PM USA and UST and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees.  Various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, tax, contraband shipments, patent infringement, employment matters, claims for contribution and claims of competitors or distributors. 
  Litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases.  An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.  Damages claimed in some tobacco-related and other litigation are or can be significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions of dollars.  The variability in pleadings in  

multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome.  In certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants  liability is joint and several.  In such cases, Altria Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment.  As a result, Altria Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts.  Furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, Altria Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys  fees. 
  Although PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse  

70 

     Table of Contents  
  Altria Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  _________________________ 

verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases.  This risk has been substantially reduced given that   47   states and Puerto Rico limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all.  As discussed below, however, tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well.  Such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court.  States, including Florida, may also seek to repeal or alter bond cap statutes through legislation.  Although Altria Group, Inc. cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc., or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges. 
  Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed elsewhere in this   Note 18  .   Contingencies  : (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.  Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred.  
  Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation.  Nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain.  It is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc., or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation.  Altria Group, Inc. and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts.  Each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges.  However, Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of Altria Group, Inc. to do so. 
    
  Overview of Altria Group, Inc. and/or PM USA Tobacco-Related Litigation  
    
  Types and Number of Cases:    Claims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories: (i) smoking and health cases alleging personal injury brought on behalf of individual plaintiffs; (ii) smoking and health cases primarily alleging personal injury or seeking court-supervised  

programs for ongoing medical monitoring and purporting to be brought on behalf of a class of individual plaintiffs, including cases in which the aggregated claims of a number of individual plaintiffs are to be tried in a single proceeding; (iii) health care cost recovery cases brought by governmental (both domestic and foreign) plaintiffs seeking reimbursement for health care expenditures allegedly caused by cigarette smoking and/or disgorgement of profits; (iv) class action suits alleging that the uses of the terms  Lights  and  Ultra Lights  constitute deceptive and unfair trade practices, common law or statutory fraud, unjust enrichment, breach of warranty or violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO  and (v) other tobacco-related litigation described below.  Plaintiffs  theories of recovery and the defenses raised in pending smoking and health, health care cost recovery and  Lights/Ultra Lights  cases are discussed below.   
  The table below lists the number of certain tobacco-related cases pending in the United States against PM USA and, in some instances, Altria Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: 

(1)      Does not include   2,414   cases brought by flight attendants seeking compensatory damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ).  The flight attendants allege that they are members of an ETS smoking and health class action in Florida, which was settled in 1997 (  Broin  ).  The terms of the court-approved settlement in that case allowed class members to file individual lawsuits seeking compensatory damages, but prohibited them from seeking punitive damages.  Also, does not include individual smoking and health cases brought by or on behalf of plaintiffs in Florida state and federal courts following the decertification of the   Engle   case (discussed below in   Smoking and Health Litigation - Engle Class Action  ).   
   (2)    Includes as one case the   30   civil actions that were to be tried in   six   consolidated trials in West Virginia (  In re: Tobacco Litigation  ).  PM USA is a defendant in   nine   of the   30   cases.  The parties have agreed to resolve the cases for an immaterial amount and have so notified the court.  
   (3)      See   Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - Federal Government s Lawsuit   below. 
    
      International Tobacco-Related Cases:    As of January 29, 2018, PM USA is a named defendant in   10   health care cost recovery actions in Canada,   eight   of which also name Altria Group, Inc. as a defendant. PM USA and Altria Group, Inc. are also named defendants in   seven   smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces.  See   Guarantees and Other Similar Matters   below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products.

Tobacco-Related Cases Set for Trial:    As of January 29, 2018,   three     Engle   progeny cases are set for trial through March 31, 2018.  There are   no   other individual smoking and health cases against PM USA set for trial during this period.  Cases against other companies in the tobacco industry may be scheduled for trial during this period.  Trial dates are subject to change.  
    
     Trial Results:    Since January 1999, excluding the   Engle   progeny cases (separately discussed below), verdicts have been returned in   63   smoking and health,  Lights/Ultra Lights  and health care cost recovery cases in which PM USA was a defendant. Verdicts in favor of PM USA and other defendants were returned in   42   of the   63   cases.  These   42   cases were tried in Alaska (  1  ), California (  7  ), Connecticut (  1  ), Florida (  10  ), Louisiana (  1  ), Massachusetts (  2  ), Mississippi (  1  ), Missouri (  4  ), New Hampshire (  1  ), New Jersey (  1  ), New York (  5  ), Ohio (  2  ), Pennsylvania (  1  ), Rhode Island (  1  ), Tennessee (  2  ) and West Virginia (  2  ).  A motion for a new trial was granted in   one   of the cases in Florida and in the case in Alaska.      In the Alaska case (  Hunter  ), the trial court withdrew its order for a new trial upon PM USA s motion for reconsideration.  In December 2015, the Alaska Supreme Court reversed the trial court decision and remanded the case with directions for the trial court to reassess whether to grant a new trial.  In March 2016, the trial court granted a new trial and PM USA filed a petition for review of that order with the Alaska Supreme Court, which the court denied in July 2016.  The retrial began in October 2016.  In November 2016, the court declared a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict.  The plaintiff subsequently moved for a new trial, which is scheduled to begin April 9, 2018.  See   Types and Number of Cases   above for a discussion of the trial results in   In re: Tobacco Litigation   (West Virginia consolidated cases). 
  Of the   21   non-  Engle   progeny cases in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs,   18   have reached final resolution.  
  As of January 29, 2018,   116   state and federal   Engle   progeny cases involving PM USA have resulted in verdicts since the Florida Supreme Court s   Engle   decision as follows:   61   verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs;   45   verdicts were returned in favor of PM USA.   Eight   verdicts that were initially returned in favor of plaintiff were reversed post-trial or on appeal and remain pending and   two   verdicts in favor of PM USA were reversed for a new trial.  See   Smoking and Health Litigation - Engle Progeny Trial Court Results   below for a discussion of these verdicts.   

Judgments Paid and Provisions for Tobacco and Health Litigation Items (Including   Engle   Progeny Litigation):    After exhausting all appeals in those cases resulting in adverse verdicts associated with tobacco-related litigation, since October 2004, PM USA has paid in the aggregate judgments and settlements (including related costs and fees) totaling approximately   $490 million   and interest totaling approximately   $184 million   as of December 31, 2017.  These amounts include payments for   Engle   progeny judgments (and related costs and fees) totaling approximately   $99 million  , interest totaling approximately   $22 million   and payment of approximately   $43 million   in connection with the Federal   Engle   Agreement, discussed below. 
  The changes in Altria Group, Inc. s accrued liability for tobacco and health litigation items, including related interest costs, for the periods specified below are as follows:  

The accrued liability for tobacco and health litigation items, including related interest costs, was included in liabilities on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated balance sheets.  Pre-tax charges for tobacco and health judgments, the agreement to resolve federal   Engle   progeny cases and the agreements to resolve the   Aspinall    and   Miner    lights  class action cases (excluding related interest costs of approximately   $10 million   in   Aspinall  ) were included in marketing, administration and research costs on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statements of earnings.  Pre-tax charges for related interest costs were included in interest and other debt expense, net on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated statements of earnings. 
    
     Security for Judgments:    To obtain stays of judgments pending current appeals, as of   December 31, 2017  , PM USA has posted various forms of security totaling approximately   $61 million  , the majority of which has been collateralized with cash deposits that are included in assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Smoking and Health Litigation 
    
     Overview:    Plaintiffs  allegations of liability in smoking and health cases are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, nuisance, breach of express and implied warranties, breach of special duty, conspiracy, concert of action, violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes, and claims under the federal and state anti-racketeering statutes.  Plaintiffs in the smoking and health cases seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, treble/multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties, creation of medical monitoring and smoking cessation funds, disgorgement of profits, and injunctive and equitable relief.  Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, comparative fault and/or contributory negligence, statutes of limitations and preemption by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.  
    
     Non-  Engle   Progeny Litigation:    Summarized below are the non-  Engle   progeny smoking and health cases pending during 2017 in which a verdict was returned in favor of plaintiff and against PM USA.  Charts listing certain verdicts for plaintiffs in the   Engle   progeny cases can be found in   Smoking and Health Litigation - Engle Progeny Trial Results   below.    
    
  Gentile  :  In October 2017, a jury in a Florida state court returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff, awarding approximately   $7.1 million   in compensatory damages and allocating   75%   of the fault to PM USA (an amount of approximately   $5.3 million  ).  Subsequently, in October 2017, PM USA filed various post-trial motions.  
    
  Bullock  :  In December 2015, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff, awarding   $900,000   in compensatory damages.  In January 2016, the plaintiff moved for a new trial, which the district court denied in February 2016.  In March 2016, PM USA filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and plaintiff cross-appealed.  In December 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, PM USA recorded a provision on its consolidated balance sheet of approximately   $1 million   for the judgment plus interest and associated costs.

     Engle   Class Action:    In July 2000, in the second phase of the   Engle   smoking and health class action in Florida, a jury returned a verdict assessing punitive damages totaling approximately   $145 billion   against various defendants, including   $74 billion   against PM USA. Following entry of judgment, PM USA appealed.  

In May 2001, the trial court approved a stipulation providing that execution of the punitive damages component of the   Engle   judgment will remain stayed against PM USA and the other participating defendants through the completion of all judicial review.  As a result of the stipulation, PM USA placed   $500 million   into an interest-bearing escrow account that, regardless of the outcome of the judicial review, was to be paid to the court and the court was to determine how to allocate or distribute it consistent with Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.  In May 2003, the Florida Third District Court of Appeal reversed the judgment entered by the trial court and instructed the trial court to order the decertification of the class.  Plaintiffs petitioned the Florida Supreme Court for further review.  
  In July 2006, the Florida Supreme Court ordered that the punitive damages award be vacated, that the class approved by the trial court be decertified and that members of the decertified class could file individual actions against defendants within   one year   of issuance of the mandate.  The court further declared the following Phase I findings are entitled to   res judicata   effect in such individual actions brought within   one year   of the issuance of the mandate: (i) that smoking causes various diseases; (ii) that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive; (iii) that defendants  cigarettes were defective and unreasonably dangerous; (iv) that defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking; (v) that defendants agreed to misrepresent information regarding the health effects or addictive nature of cigarettes with the intention of causing the public to rely on this information to their detriment; (vi) that defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers would rely on the information to their detriment; (vii) that all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective; and (viii) that defendants were negligent.  The court also reinstated compensatory damages awards totaling approximately   $6.9 million   to   two   individual plaintiffs and found that a third plaintiff s claim was barred by the statute of limitations.  In   February 2008  , PM USA paid approximately   $3 million  , representing its share of compensatory damages and interest, to the   two   individual plaintiffs identified in the Florida Supreme Court s order. 
  In August 2006, PM USA sought rehearing from the Florida Supreme Court on parts of its July 2006 opinion, including the ruling (described above) that certain jury findings have   res judicata   effect in subsequent individual trials timely brought by   Engle   class members.  The rehearing motion also asked, among other things, that legal errors that were raised but not expressly ruled upon in the Florida Third District Court of Appeal or in the Florida Supreme Court now be addressed.  Plaintiffs also filed a motion for rehearing in August 2006 seeking clarification of the applicability of the statute of limitations to non-members of the decertified class.  In December 2006, the Florida Supreme Court refused to revise its July 2006 ruling, except that it revised the set of Phase I findings entitled to   res judicata   effect by excluding finding (v) listed above (relating to agreement to misrepresent

information), and added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that, at the time of sale or supply, did not conform to the representations of fact made by defendants.  In January 2007, the Florida Supreme Court issued the mandate from its revised opinion.  Defendants then filed a motion with the Florida Third District Court of Appeal requesting that the court address legal errors that were previously raised by defendants but have not yet been addressed either by the Florida Third District Court of Appeal or by the Florida Supreme Court.  In February 2007, the Florida Third District Court of Appeal denied defendants  motion.  In May 2007, defendants  motion for a partial stay of the mandate pending the completion of appellate review was denied by the Florida Third District Court of Appeal.  In May 2007, defendants filed a petition for   writ of certiorari   with the United States Supreme Court, which the United States Supreme Court denied later in 2007. 
  In February 2008, the trial court decertified the class, except for purposes of the May 2001 bond stipulation, and formally vacated the punitive damages award pursuant to the Florida Supreme Court s mandate.  In April 2008, the trial court ruled that certain defendants, including PM USA, lacked standing with respect to allocation of the funds escrowed under the May 2001 bond stipulation and would receive no credit at that time from the   $500 million   paid by PM USA against any future punitive damages awards in cases brought by former   Engle   class members.  
  In May 2008, the trial court, among other things, decertified the limited class maintained for purposes of the May 2001 bond stipulation and, in July 2008, severed the remaining plaintiffs  claims except for those of Howard Engle.  The only remaining plaintiff in the   Engle   case, Howard Engle, voluntarily dismissed his claims with prejudice.  
    
     Engle   Progeny Cases:    The deadline for filing   Engle   progeny cases, as required by the Florida Supreme Court s   Engle   decision, expired in January 2008.  As of January 29, 2018, approximately   2,400   state court cases were pending against PM USA or Altria Group, Inc. asserting individual claims by or on behalf of approximately   3,100   state court plaintiffs.  Because of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, docketing delays, duplicated filings and overlapping dismissal orders, these numbers are estimates.  While the Federal   Engle   Agreement (discussed below) resolved nearly all   Engle   progeny cases pending in federal court, as of January 29, 2018, approximately   12   cases were pending against PM USA in federal court representing the cases excluded from that agreement.  
    
     Agreement to Resolve Federal   Engle   Progeny Cases:    In 2015, PM USA, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company ( R.J. Reynolds ) and Lorillard Tobacco Company ( Lorillard ) resolved approximately   415   pending federal   Engle   progeny cases (the  Federal   Engle   Agreement ).  Under the terms of the Federal   Engle   Agreement, PM USA paid approximately   $43 million  .  Federal cases that were in trial and those that previously reached final verdict were not included in the Federal   Engle   Agreement.  

Engle   Progeny Trial Results:    As of January 29, 2018,   116   federal and state   Engle   progeny cases involving PM USA have resulted in verdicts since the Florida Supreme Court   Engle   decision.    Sixty-one   verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs and   eight   verdicts (  Skolnick, Calloway  ,   Pollari  ,   McCoy  ,   Duignan  ,   McCall,     Caprio   and   Oshinsky-Blacker  ) that were initially returned in favor of plaintiffs were reversed post-trial or on appeal and remain pending.    Skolnick   was remanded for a new trial;   Calloway   was reversed and remanded for a new trial on an appellate finding that improper arguments by plaintiff s counsel deprived defendants of a fair trial;   Pollari   and   McCoy   were reversed and remanded for a new trial on an appellate finding that the trial court erred in admitting certain materials into evidence that deprived defendants of a fair trial;   Duignan   was reversed and remanded for a new trial on an appellate finding that the trial judge erred in responding to a question from the jury during deliberations;   Caprio   was reversed post-trial after defendants agreed to voluntarily dismiss their appeal in exchange for a full retrial;   Oshinsky-Blacker   was reversed post-trial based on plaintiff s counsel s improper arguments at trial; and   McCall   was reversed based on an appellate finding that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury on the warning labels on cigarette packs. 
    Forty-five   verdicts were returned in favor of PM USA, of which   36   were state cases.  In addition, there have been a number of mistrials, only some of which have resulted in new trials as of January 29, 2018.    Two   verdicts (  D. Cohen   and   Collar  ) that were returned in favor of PM USA were subsequently reversed for new trials.  The juries in the   Reider   and   Banks   cases returned   zero   damages verdicts in favor of PM USA  .    The juries in the   Weingart   and   Hancock   cases returned verdicts against PM USA awarding   no   damages, but the trial court in each case granted an   additur  .  
  The charts below list the verdicts and post-trial developments in certain   Engle   progeny cases in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs (including   Hancock  , where the verdict originally was returned in favor of PM USA).  The first chart lists such cases that are pending as of January 29, 2018; the second chart lists such cases that were pending within the previous 12 months, but that are now concluded.

  In May and June 2012, defendants filed motions to set aside the verdict and for a new trial.  In August 2012, the trial court denied the remaining post-trial motions, reduced the compensatory damages to   $16.1 million   and entered final judgment without any deduction for plaintiff s comparative fault.  In September 2012, PM USA posted a bond in an amount of   $1.5 million   and defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal.  In August 2013, plaintiff filed a motion to determine the sufficiency of the bond in the trial court on the ground that the bond cap statute is unconstitutional, which the court denied.  In January 2016, a panel of the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal vacated the punitive damages award and remanded the case for retrial on plaintiff s claims of concealment and conspiracy, and punitive damages.  The court also found that the trial court should have applied the comparative fault deduction, reducing the compensatory damages against PM USA to   $4.025 million  .  In February 2016, defendants and plaintiff filed respective motions for rehearing and rehearing   en banc  .  In March 2016, plaintiff filed a notice of supplemental authority citing the   Soffer   decision, discussed below under   Engle Progeny Appellate Issues  .  In September 2016, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal, ruling   en banc  , reversed the judgment against PM USA and R.J. Reynolds in its entirety on the grounds that improper arguments by plaintiff s counsel deprived defendants of a fair trial, and ordered a new trial.  In October 2016, plaintiff filed a notice to invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of the Florida Supreme Court, which the court denied in March 2017.  In June 2017, plaintiff filed a petition for   writ of certiorari   with the United States Supreme Court seeking review of the 2016   en banc   ruling by the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal, which the court denied in October 2017.

  Verdict: 
  A Broward County jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against PM USA, R.J. Reynolds and Liggett Group.  The jury awarded approximately   $15.1 million   in compensatory damages and allocated   15%   of the fault to PM USA (an amount of approximately   $2.3 million  ).  The jury also awarded   $2.5 million   in punitive damages against PM USA. 
    
  Post-Trial Developments: 
  In August 2010, the trial court entered final judgment with a deduction for plaintiff s comparative fault.  PM USA filed its notice of appeal to the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal and, in November 2010, posted a   $1.6 million   bond.  In June 2013, the Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings, holding that the trial court erred in (1) not reducing the compensatory damages award as excessive and (2) not instructing the jury on the statute of repose in connection with plaintiff s conspiracy claim that resulted in the   $2.5 million   punitive damages award.  In July 2013, plaintiff filed a motion for rehearing, which the Fourth District Court of Appeal denied in August 2013.  In September 2013, both parties filed notices to invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of the Florida Supreme Court.  In December 2013, the Florida Supreme Court stayed the appeal pending the outcome of the   Hess   case.  In April 2015, the Florida Supreme Court rejected the statute of repose defense in   Hess  , and PM USA moved for a rehearing.  In September 2015, the Florida Supreme Court denied PM USA s rehearing petition in   Hess  . In February 2016, the Florida Supreme Court upheld the trial court s decision in favor of plaintiff and, in March 2016, clarified that its February 2016 order reinstated the trial court s decision on the statute of repose only.  In August 2016, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal reinstated the jury s punitive damages verdict and reaffirmed that the compensatory damages award was excessive, remanding the case to the trial court to reduce the compensatory damages.   In May 2017, the trial court ruled that the 2010 jury award of   $15.1 million   in compensatory damages was excessive and reduced the award to   $225,000  .  In June 2017, plaintiff requested a new trial on compensatory damages.

Engle   Progeny Appellate Issues:   In   Douglas  , an   Engle   progeny case against PM USA and R.J. Reynolds, in March 2012, the Florida Second District Court of Appeal issued a decision affirming the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff and upholding the use of the   Engle   jury findings with respect to strict liability claims but certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question of whether granting   res judicata   effect to the   Engle   jury findings violates defendants  federal due process rights.  In March 2013, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the final judgment entered in favor of plaintiff upholding the use of the   Engle   jury findings with respect to strict liability and negligence claims.  PM USA s subsequent petition for   writ of certiorari   with the United States Supreme Court was unsuccessful. 
  In   Graham  , an   Engle   progeny case against PM USA and R.J. Reynolds, in April 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found in favor of defendants on the basis of federal preemption, reversing the trial court s denial of judgment as a matter of law.  Thereafter, plaintiff filed a petition for rehearing   en banc  , which the Eleventh Circuit granted in January 2016.  In May 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected defendants  preemption and due process arguments and affirmed the final judgment entered in plaintiff s favor.  In September 2017, defendants filed a petition for   writ of certiorari   with the United States Supreme Court on due process and federal preemption grounds, which the court denied in January 2018.  In January 2016, in   Marotta  , a case against R.J. Reynolds on appeal to the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal, the court rejected R.J. Reynolds s federal preemption defense, but noted the conflict with   Graham   and certified the preemption question to the Florida Supreme Court.  In March 2016, the Florida Supreme Court accepted review of   Marotta   and in April 2017, affirmed the Fourth District Court of Appeal s ruling on preemption. 
  In   Searcy  , an   Engle   progeny case against PM USA and R.J. Reynolds on appeal to the Eleventh Circuit, defendants argued that application of the   Engle   findings to the   Engle   progeny plaintiffs  concealment and conspiracy claims violated defendants  due process rights.  The appeal is pending.  In January 2018, the Eleventh Circuit ordered supplemental briefing on the due process issues.   

In   Soffer  , an   Engle   progeny case against R.J. Reynolds, the Florida First District Court of Appeal held that   Engle   progeny plaintiffs can recover punitive damages only on their intentional tort claims.  The Florida Supreme Court accepted jurisdiction over plaintiff s appeal from the Florida First District Court of Appeal s decision and, in March 2016, held that   Engle   progeny plaintiffs can recover punitive damages in connection with all of their claims.  Plaintiffs now generally seek punitive damages in connection with all of their claims in   Engle   progeny cases. 
  In   Schoeff  , an   Engle   progeny case against R.J. Reynolds, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal held that comparative fault findings should apply to reduce all compensatory damage awards, including awards based on intentional fraud claims.  The Florida Supreme Court accepted jurisdiction over plaintiff s appeal of the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal s decision.  In December 2017, the Florida Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal s decision, finding that comparative fault does not reduce compensatory damages awards for intentional torts.  
    
     Florida Bond Statute:    In June 2009, Florida amended its existing bond cap statute by adding a   $200 million   bond cap that applies to all state   Engle   progeny lawsuits in the aggregate and establishes individual bond caps for individual   Engle   progeny cases in amounts that vary depending on the number of judgments in effect at a given time.  Plaintiffs in   three   state   Engle   progeny cases against R.J. Reynolds in Alachua County, Florida (  Alexander  ,   Townsend   and   Hall  ) and   one   case in Escambia County (  Clay  ) challenged the constitutionality of the bond cap statute.  The Florida Attorney General intervened in these cases in defense of the constitutionality of the statute. 
  Trial court rulings were rendered in   Clay  ,   Alexander  ,   Townsend   and   Hall   rejecting the plaintiffs  bond cap statute challenges in those cases.  The plaintiffs unsuccessfully appealed these rulings.  In   Alexander  ,   Clay   and   Hall  , the District Court of Appeal for the First District of Florida affirmed the trial court decisions and certified the decision in   Hall   for appeal to the Florida Supreme Court, but declined to certify the question of the constitutionality of the bond cap statute in   Clay   and   Alexander  .  The Florida Supreme Court granted review of the   Hall   decision, but, in September 2012, the court dismissed the appeal as moot.  In October 2012, the Florida Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs

rehearing petition.  In August 2013, in   Calloway  , discussed further above, plaintiff filed a motion in the trial court to determine the sufficiency of the bond posted by defendants on the ground that the bond cap statute is unconstitutional, which was denied. 
  In February 2016, in the   Sikes   case against R.J. Reynolds, the trial court held that Florida s bond cap statute does not stay the execution of judgment after a case is final in the Florida judicial system and before the defendant files a petition for   writ of certiorari   with the United States Supreme Court.  The District Court of Appeal for the First District of Florida issued an order staying execution of the judgment and requesting that plaintiff show cause why the stay should not remain in effect through the completion of United States Supreme Court   writ of certiorari   review or until the time for moving for such review has expired.  In April 2016, the District Court of Appeal held that the bond cap applies to the period between a Florida Supreme Court ruling and completion of United States Supreme Court   writ of certiorari   review.  In April 2016, PM USA filed motions in the trial court in the   R. Cohen   and   Kayton   cases seeking confirmation that the stay on executing the judgment remains in effect through the completion of United States Supreme Court   writ of certiorari   review or until the time for moving for such review has expired, which the court granted.  
  No federal court has yet addressed the constitutionality of the bond cap statute or the applicability of the bond cap to   Engle   progeny cases tried in federal court.  
  The Florida legislature is considering legislation that would repeal the 2009 appeal bond cap statute. 
    
  Other Smoking and Health Class Actions 
    
  Since the dismissal in May 1996 of a purported nationwide class action brought on behalf of allegedly addicted smokers, plaintiffs have filed numerous putative smoking and health class action suits in various state and federal courts.  In general, these cases purport to be brought on behalf of residents of a particular state or states (although a few cases purport to be nationwide in scope) and raise addiction claims and, in many cases, claims of physical injury as well. 
  Class certification has been denied or reversed by courts in   61   smoking and health class actions involving PM USA in Arkansas (  1  ), California (  1  ), Delaware (  1  ), the District of Columbia (  2  ), Florida (  2  ), Illinois (  3  ), Iowa (  1  ), Kansas (  1  ), Louisiana (  1  ), Maryland (  1  ), Michigan (  1  ), Minnesota (  1  ), Nevada (  29  ), New Jersey (  6  ), New York (  2  ), Ohio (  1  ), Oklahoma (  1  ), Oregon (  1  ), Pennsylvania (  1  ), Puerto Rico (  1  ), South Carolina (  1  ), Texas (  1  ) and Wisconsin (  1  ).  
  As of January 29, 2018, PM USA and Altria Group, Inc. are named as defendants, along with other cigarette manufacturers, in   seven   class actions filed in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Ontario.  In Saskatchewan, British Columbia (  two   separate cases) and Ontario, plaintiffs seek class certification on behalf of individuals who suffer or have suffered from various diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema,  

heart disease or cancer, after smoking defendants  cigarettes.  In the actions filed in Alberta, Manitoba and Nova Scotia, plaintiffs seek certification of classes of all individuals who smoked defendants  cigarettes.  See   Guarantees and Other Similar Matters   below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products. 
    
  Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation 
    
     Overview:    In the health care cost recovery litigation, governmental entities seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and, in some cases, of future expenditures and damages.  Relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages, multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties, injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors, disclosure of research, disgorgement of profits, funding of anti-smoking programs, additional disclosure of nicotine yields, and payment of attorney and expert witness fees.  
  Although there have been some decisions to the contrary, most judicial decisions in the United States have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers.  Nine federal circuit courts of appeals and eight state appellate courts, relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs  claims were too remote, have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions.  The United States Supreme Court has refused to consider plaintiffs  appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals.  
  In addition to the cases brought in the United States, health care cost recovery actions have also been brought against tobacco industry participants, including PM USA and Altria Group, Inc., in Israel (dismissed), the Marshall Islands (dismissed) and Canada (  10   cases), and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions. 
  In September 2005, in the first of several health care cost recovery cases filed in Canada, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that legislation passed in British Columbia permitting the lawsuit is constitutional, and, as a result, the case, which had previously been dismissed by the trial court, was permitted to proceed.  PM USA s and other defendants  challenge to the British Columbia court s exercise of jurisdiction was rejected by the Court of Appeals of British Columbia and, in April 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada denied review of that decision.  
  Since the beginning of 2008, the Canadian Provinces of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia have brought health care reimbursement claims against cigarette manufacturers.  PM USA is named as a defendant in the British Columbia and Quebec cases, while both Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA are named as defendants in the New Brunswick, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia cases.  The Nunavut Territory and Northwest Territory have passed similar legislation.  See   Guarantees and Other Similar Matters   below for a discussion of

the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products. 
    
     Settlements of Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation:   In   November 1998  , PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (the  MSA ) with   46   states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, the  State Settlement Agreements ). The State Settlement Agreements require that the original participating manufacturers or  OPMs  (now PM USA and R.J. Reynolds and, with respect to certain brands, ITG Brands, LLC ( ITG )) make annual payments of approximately   $9.4 billion  , subject to adjustments for several factors, including inflation, market share and industry volume. In addition, the OPMs are required to pay settling plaintiffs  attorneys  fees, subject to an annual cap of   $500 million  . For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate amount recorded in cost of sales with respect to the State Settlement Agreements was approximately   $4.5 billion  ,   $4.6 billion   and   $4.5 billion  , respectively.  These amounts include PM USA s estimate of amounts related to NPM Adjustments discussed below. 
  The State Settlement Agreements also include advertising and marketing restrictions, require public disclosure of certain industry documents, limit challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws, and restrict lobbying activities. 
     NPM Adjustment Disputes:   The MSA provides for potential downward adjustments to MSA payments (the  NPM Adjustment ) made by the OPMs and those manufacturers that are subsequent signatories to the MSA (collectively, the  participating manufacturers  or  PMs ).  PM USA is participating in proceedings regarding the NPM Adjustment for 2003-2016.  The NPM Adjustment is a reduction in MSA payments that applies if the PMs collectively lose at least a specified level of market share to non-participating manufacturers since 1997, subject to certain conditions and defenses. The independent auditor (the  IA ) appointed under the MSA calculates the maximum amount of the NPM Adjustment, if any, for each year. 
       
  2003-2015 NPM Adjustment Disputes - Settlement with 26 States and Territories and Settlement with New York  .    PM USA has entered into   two   settlements of NPM Adjustment disputes with a total of   27   states and territories.  The first settlement was originally entered into in 2012 with   19   states and territories and has been subsequently expanded to include a total of   26   of the   52   MSA states and territories (the  signatory states ).  In the first settlement, PM USA settled the NPM Adjustment disputes for 2003-2015 with these   26   states in exchange for a total of   $740 million  .  In the second settlement, related specifically to New  

York, which was entered into in 2015, PM USA received approximately   $170 million   for 2004-2015.  Both settlements also resolved certain disputes regarding the application of the NPM Adjustment going forward. 
    
  2003 and Subsequent NPM Adjustment Disputes - Continuing Disputes with States that have not Settled  .  
    
     2003 NPM Adjustment.    In September 2013, an arbitration panel issued rulings regarding the   15   states and territories that remained in the arbitration, ruling that   six   of them did not establish valid defenses to the NPM Adjustment for 2003.    Two   of these states later joined the first settlement discussed above.  With respect to the remaining   four   states, following the outcome of challenges in state courts, PM USA ultimately recorded   $74 million   primarily as a reduction to cost of sales.    Two   potential disputes remain outstanding regarding the amount of interest and there is no assurance that PM USA will prevail in either of these disputes. 
    
     2004 and Subsequent NPM Adjustments.    PM USA has continued to pursue the NPM Adjustments for 2004 and subsequent years in multi-state arbitrations against the states that did not join either of the settlements discussed above.  New Mexico is currently appealing a trial court ruling that the state must participate in the multi-state arbitration for 2004.  The Montana state courts ruled that Montana may litigate its claims in state court, rather than participate in arbitration. 
  The 2004 multi-state arbitration is currently pending with all of the states that have not settled other than Montana and New Mexico.  Decisions are not expected until late 2018 at the earliest.  
  No assurance can be given as to when proceedings for 2005 and subsequent years will be scheduled or the precise form those proceedings will take. 
  The IA has calculated that PM USA s share of the maximum potential NPM Adjustments for 2004-2016 is (exclusive of interest or earnings):   $388 million   for 2004;   $181 million   for 2005;   $154 million   for 2006;   $185 million   for 2007;   $250 million   for 2008;   $211 million   for 2009;   $218 million   for 2010;   $166 million   for 2011;   $214 million   for 2012;   $223 million   for 2013;   $246 million   for 2014;   $292 million   for 2015 and   $296 million   for 2016.  These maximum amounts will be reduced, likely substantially, to reflect the settlements with the signatory states and New York, and potentially for current and future calculation disputes and other developments. Finally, PM USA s recovery of these amounts, even as reduced, is dependent upon subsequent determinations regarding state-specific defenses.  
    
     Other Disputes Under the State Settlement Agreements:    The payment obligations of the tobacco product manufacturers that are parties to the State Settlement Agreements, as well as the allocations of any NPM Adjustments and related settlements, have been and may continue to be affected by R.J. Reynolds  acquisition of Lorillard and its related sale of certain cigarette brands to ITG (the  ITG brands ). In particular, R.J. Reynolds and ITG have asserted that they do not have to make payments on  

92

  _________________________ 

the ITG brands under the Florida, Minnesota and Texas State Settlement Agreements or include the ITG brands for purposes of certain calculations under the State Settlement Agreements. PM USA believes that R.J. Reynolds  and ITG s position violates the State Settlement Agreements and applicable law.  PM USA further believes that these actions: (i) improperly increased PM USA s payments for 2015 and 2016 by at least   $84 million  ; (ii) may improperly increase PM USA s payments for subsequent years; (iii) may improperly decrease PM USA s share of the 2015 and 2016 NPM Adjustments and the settlements of related disputes; and (iv) may improperly decrease PM USA s share of NPM Adjustments and related settlements for subsequent years.  
  PM USA and the State of Florida each filed a motion in Florida state court against R.J. Reynolds and ITG seeking to enforce the Florida State Settlement Agreement.  In December 2017, the Florida trial court ruled that R.J. Reynolds (and not ITG) must make settlement payments under the Florida State Settlement Agreement on the ITG brands.  
    
     Federal Government s Lawsuit:    In 1999, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against various cigarette manufacturers, including PM USA, and others, including Altria Group, Inc., asserting claims under three federal statutes, namely the Medical Care Recovery Act ( MCRA ), the MSP provisions of the Social Security Act and the civil provisions of RICO.  The case ultimately proceeded only under the civil provisions of RICO, and the trial ended in June 2005. In August 2006, the district court entered judgment in favor of the government.  The court held that certain defendants, including Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA, violated RICO and engaged in   seven   of the   eight    sub-schemes  to defraud that the government had alleged.  Specifically, the court found that:   

defendants falsely denied, distorted and minimized the significant adverse health consequences of smoking;  

defendants hid from the public that cigarette smoking and nicotine are addictive;  

defendants falsely denied that they control the level of nicotine delivered to create and sustain addiction;  

defendants falsely marketed and promoted  low tar/light  cigarettes as less harmful than full-flavor cigarettes;  

defendants falsely denied that they intentionally marketed to youth;  

defendants publicly and falsely denied that ETS is hazardous to non-smokers; and  

defendants suppressed scientific research.  

The court did not impose monetary penalties on defendants, but ordered the following relief: (i) an injunction against  committing any act of racketeering  relating to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion, health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the United States; (ii) an injunction against participating directly or indirectly in the management or control of the Council for Tobacco Research, the Tobacco Institute, or the Center for Indoor Air Research, or any successor or affiliated entities of each; (iii) an injunction against  making, or causing to be made in any way, any material false, misleading, or deceptive statement or representation or engaging in any public relations or marketing endeavor that is disseminated to the United States public and that misrepresents or suppresses information concerning cigarettes  (iv) an injunction against conveying any express or implied health message or health descriptors on cigarette packaging or in cigarette advertising or promotional material, including  lights,   ultra lights  and  low tar,  which the court found could cause consumers to believe   one   cigarette brand is less hazardous than another brand; (v) the issuance of  corrective statements  in various media regarding the adverse health effects of smoking, the addictiveness of smoking and nicotine, the lack of any significant health benefit from smoking  low tar  or  light  cigarettes, defendants  manipulation of cigarette design to ensure optimum nicotine delivery and the adverse health effects of exposure to ETS; (vi) the disclosure on defendants  public document websites and in the Minnesota document repository of all documents produced to the government in the lawsuit or produced in any future court or administrative action concerning smoking and health until 2021, with certain additional requirements as to documents withheld from production under a claim of privilege or confidentiality; (vii) the disclosure of disaggregated marketing data to the government in the same form and on the same schedule as defendants now follow in disclosing such data to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) for a period of   10   years; (viii) certain restrictions on the sale or transfer by defendants of any cigarette brands, brand names, formulas or cigarette businesses within the United States; and (ix) payment of the government s costs in bringing the action. 
  Defendants appealed and, in May 2009, a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( D.C. Court of Appeals ) largely affirmed the trial court s remedial order, but vacated the following aspects of the order:  

its application to defendants  subsidiaries;  

the prohibition on the use of express or implied health messages or health descriptors, but only to the extent of extraterritorial application;  

its point-of-sale display provisions; and  

its application to Brown   Williamson Holdings.

  _________________________ 

The appellate panel remanded the case for the trial court to reconsider these four aspects of the injunction and to reformulate its remedial order accordingly.  
  In November 2012, the district court issued its order specifying the content of the corrective communications described above and defendants appealed.  In April 2014, the parties submitted a motion for entry of a consent order in the district court, setting forth their agreement on the implementation details of the corrective communications remedy, which the district court approved in June 2014.  In May 2015, the D.C. Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the appeal on the content of the corrective communications, concluding that certain portions of the statements exceeded the district court s jurisdiction under RICO, but upheld other portions challenged by defendants.  The D.C. Court of Appeals remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.  
  In February 2016, the district court issued an order adopting modified corrective statements.  Defendants appealed and, in April 2017, the D.C. Court of Appeals reversed in part the district court s decision on the content of the corrective communications, striking certain content and remanding to the district court the decision on how to revise certain other content.  In June 2017, the district court issued an order adopting modified corrective statements.  In October 2017, the court approved the parties  proposed consent order implementing the corrective communications remedy for newspapers and television.   The corrective statements began appearing in newspapers and on television in the fourth quarter of 2017. In January 2018, the parties submitted a status report and a request for a status conference to address open issues regarding onsert and website implementation details.  The defendants also filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to mediate the remaining implementation details and for an order clarifying that the DOJ may not enforce the previous consent order with respect to onserts and websites prior to resolution of all implementation details. 
  In the second quarter of 2014, Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA recorded provisions on each of their respective balance sheets totaling   $31 million   for the estimated costs of implementing the corrective communications remedy.  This estimate is subject to change due to several factors, though Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA do not expect any change in this estimate to be material. 
  The consent order approved by the district court in June 2014 did not address the requirements related to point-of-sale signage.  In May 2014, the district court ordered further briefing by the parties on the issue of corrective statements on point-of-sale signage, which was completed in June 2014. 
  In   December 2011  , the parties to the lawsuit entered into an agreement as to the issues concerning the document repository.  Pursuant to this agreement, PM USA agreed to deposit an amount of approximately   $3.1 million   into the district court in installments over a   five  -year period. 

Lights/Ultra Lights  Cases 
    
     Overview:    Plaintiffs have sought certification of their cases as class actions, alleging among other things, that the uses of the terms  Lights  and/or  Ultra Lights  constitute deceptive and unfair trade practices, common law or statutory fraud, unjust enrichment or breach of warranty, and have sought injunctive and equitable relief, including restitution and, in certain cases, punitive damages.  These class actions have been brought against PM USA and, in certain instances, Altria Group, Inc. or its other subsidiaries, on behalf of individuals who purchased and consumed various brands of cigarettes, including   Marlboro   Lights,   Marlboro   Ultra Lights,   Virginia Slims   Lights and Superslims,   Merit   Lights and   Cambridge   Lights. Defenses raised in these cases include lack of misrepresentation, lack of causation, injury and damages, the statute of limitations, non-liability under state statutory provisions exempting conduct that complies with federal regulatory directives, and the First Amendment.  As of January 29, 2018, a total of   three   such cases are pending in various U.S. state courts, none of which is active.  
    
     State  Lights  Cases Dismissed, Not Certified or Ordered De-Certified:    As of January 29, 2018,   21   state courts in   22    Lights  cases have refused to certify class actions, dismissed class action allegations, reversed prior class certification decisions or have entered judgment in favor of PM USA.  
    
     State Trial Court Class Certifications:    State trial courts have certified classes against PM USA in several jurisdictions.  Over time, all such cases have been dismissed by the courts at the summary judgment stage, were settled by the parties or were resolved in favor of PM USA, including   Larsen   discussed below. 
    
  Larsen  :  In August 2005, a Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed the class certification order.  Trial in the case began in September 2011 and, in October 2011, the court declared a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict. Upon retrial, in April 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of PM USA.  In August 2016, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal and PM USA cross-appealed.  In November 2016, the court of appeals dismissed PM USA s cross-appeal without prejudice upon joint motion of the parties.  On appeal, in November 2017, the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in favor of PM USA. Plaintiffs did not seek further appellate review, concluding this litigation.  
    
  Certain Other Tobacco-Related Litigation 
    
     Ignition Propensity Cases:    PM USA and Altria Group, Inc. are currently facing litigation alleging that a fire caused by cigarettes led to individuals  deaths.  In a Kentucky case (  Walker  ), the federal district court denied plaintiffs  motion to remand the case to state court and dismissed plaintiffs  claims in February 2009.  Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal.  In October 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the portion of the district court decision that denied remand of the case to Kentucky state court and remanded the case to Kentucky

state court.  The Sixth Circuit did not address the merits of the district court s dismissal order.  Defendants  petition for rehearing with the Sixth Circuit was denied in December 2011.  Defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss in state court in March 2013.  Based on new evidence, in June 2013, defendants removed the case for a second time to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky and re-filed their motion to dismiss in June 2013.  In July 2013, plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to Kentucky state court, which was granted in March 2014.  In November 2016, defendants filed renewed motions to dismiss the case, which the court granted in March 2017. 
    
     Argentine Grower Cases:    PM USA and Altria Group, Inc. were sued in   six   cases (  Hupan  ,   Chalanuk  ,   Rodriguez Da Silva  ,   Aranda  ,   Taborda   and   Biglia  ) filed in Delaware state court against multiple defendants by the parents of Argentine children born with alleged birth defects.  Plaintiffs in these cases allege that they grew tobacco in Argentina under contract with Tabacos Norte S.A., an alleged subsidiary of PMI, and that they and their infant children were exposed directly and   in utero   to Monsanto Company s ( Monsanto )   Roundup   herbicide during the production and cultivation of tobacco.  Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages against all defendants.  Altria Group, Inc. and certain other defendants were dismissed from the   Hupan  ,   Chalanuk, Rodriguez Da Silva,     Aranda  ,   Taborda   and   Biglia   cases  .    The   three   remaining defendants in the   six   cases were PM USA, Philip Morris Global Brands Inc. (a subsidiary of PMI) and Monsanto.  Following discussions regarding indemnification for these cases pursuant to the Distribution Agreement between PMI and Altria Group, Inc.,     PMI and PM USA agreed to resolve conflicting indemnity demands after final judgments are entered.  See   Guarantees and Other Similar Matters   below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement.  In April 2014, all   three   defendants in the   Hupan   case filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and PM USA and Philip Morris Global Brands filed separate motions to dismiss based on the doctrine of   forum non conveniens  .  All proceedings in the other   five   cases were stayed pending the court s resolution of the motions to dismiss filed in   Hupan  .  In November 2015, the trial court granted PM USA s motion to dismiss on   forum non conveniens   grounds.  Plaintiffs filed a motion for clarification or re-argument in December 2015, which the court denied in August 2016.  Later in August 2016, PM USA and Philip Morris Global Brands moved for entry of final judgment in the   Hupan   case and also moved to lift the stays in the other   five   cases for the limited purpose of entering final judgment of dismissal in those cases as well based on the   forum non conveniens   decision in   Hupan  .  The court granted those motions in September 2016, and entered final judgment of dismissal in all   six   cases.  In October 2016, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court.  Oral argument occurred before a panel of the Delaware Supreme Court in September 2017.  In January 2018, the case was re-argued before the Delaware Supreme Court   en banc  . 

UST Litigation 
    
  Claims related to smokeless tobacco products generally fall within the following categories:  
  First, UST and/or its tobacco subsidiaries have been named in certain actions in West Virginia (See   In re: Tobacco Litigation   above) brought by or on behalf of individual plaintiffs against cigarette manufacturers, smokeless tobacco manufacturers and other organizations seeking damages and other relief in connection with injuries allegedly sustained as a result of tobacco usage, including smokeless tobacco products.  Included among the plaintiffs are   six   individuals alleging use of USSTC s smokeless tobacco products and alleging the types of injuries claimed to be associated with the use of smokeless tobacco products. USSTC, along with other non-cigarette manufacturers, has remained severed from such proceedings since December 2001.  
  Second, UST and/or its tobacco subsidiaries have been named in a number of other individual tobacco and health suits over time.  Plaintiffs  allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery, such as negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, breach of implied warranty, addiction and breach of consumer protection statutes.  Plaintiffs seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, and certain equitable relief, including but not limited to disgorgement.  Defenses raised in these cases include lack of causation, assumption of the risk, comparative fault and/or contributory negligence, and statutes of limitations. In July 2016, USSTC and Altria Group, Inc. were named as defendants, along with other named defendants, in   one   such case in California (  Gwynn  ).  In August 2016, defendants removed the case to federal court. In September 2016, plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case back to state court, which the court granted in January 2017.  In May 2017, the court granted plaintiffs  motion to dismiss all defendants except USSTC. 
    
  Environmental Regulation 
    
  Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as  Superfund ), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party.  Subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) of Altria Group, Inc. are involved in several matters subjecting them to potential costs of remediation and natural resource damages under Superfund or other laws and regulations.  Altria Group, Inc. s subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations. 
  Altria Group, Inc. provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis  

95

when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.  Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. may undertake in the future.  In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows. 
    
  Guarantees and Other Similar Matters 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, certain subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation.  At   December 31, 2017  , Altria Group, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (i) had   $57 million   of unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business; (ii) were contingently liable for   $33 million   of guarantees, consisting primarily of surety bonds, related to their own performance; and (iii) had a redeemable noncontrolling interest of   $38 million   recorded on its consolidated balance sheet.  In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. issue lines of credit to affiliated entities.  These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria Group, Inc. s liquidity. 
  Under the terms of a distribution agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI (the  Distribution Agreement ), entered into as a result of Altria Group, Inc. s 2008 spin-off of its former subsidiary PMI, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer.  PMI will indemnify Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.  Altria Group, Inc. does not have a related liability recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2017   as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant. 
  As more fully discussed in   Note 19  .   Condensed Consolidating Financial Information  , PM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria Group, Inc. s obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program. 
    
  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest 
  In September 2007, Ste. Michelle completed the acquisition of Stag s Leap Wine Cellars through one of its consolidated subsidiaries, Michelle-Antinori, LLC ( Michelle-Antinori ), in which Ste. Michelle holds an   85%   ownership interest with a   15%   noncontrolling interest held by Antinori California ( Antinori ).  In connection with the acquisition of Stag s Leap Wine Cellars,  

Ste. Michelle entered into a put arrangement with Antinori. The put arrangement, as later amended, provides Antinori with the right to require Ste. Michelle to purchase its   15%   ownership interest in Michelle-Antinori at a price equal to Antinori s initial investment of   $27 million  . The put arrangement became exercisable in September 2010 and has no expiration date. As of December 31, 2017, the redemption value of the put arrangement did not exceed the noncontrolling interest balance. Therefore, no adjustment to the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was recognized on the consolidated balance sheet for the put arrangement. 
  The noncontrolling interest put arrangement is accounted for as mandatorily redeemable securities because redemption is outside of the control of Ste. Michelle.  As such, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is reported in the mezzanine equity section on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 and 2016. 
   
  Note 19  .  Condensed Consolidating Financial Information 
  PM USA, which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc., has guaranteed Altria Group, Inc. s obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the  Guarantees ).  Pursuant to the Guarantees, PM USA fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of Altria Group, Inc. s obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the  Obligations ), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below. 
  The Guarantees provide that PM USA guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations.  The liability of PM USA under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Altria Group, Inc. or PM USA. 
  The obligations of PM USA under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in PM USA s obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of PM USA that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees.  For this purpose,  Bankruptcy Law  means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm                 

To the Board of Directors and 
  Stockholders of Altria Group, Inc.: 
  Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the  consolidated financial statements ).  We also have audited Altria Group, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,   2017   and   2016  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,   2017   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, Altria Group, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2017  , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.   
  Basis for Opinions 
  Altria Group, Inc. s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on Altria Group, Inc. s consolidated financial statements and on Altria Group, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ( PCAOB ) and are required to be independent with respect to Altria Group, Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.   

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Management On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management of Altria Group, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

  n      pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Altria Group, Inc.; 
  n      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;

  Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  Management assessed the effectiveness of Altria Group, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2017  .  Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of Altria Group, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.  Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 

Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31,   2017  , Altria Group, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. 
  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of Altria Group, Inc. included in this report, has audited the effectiveness of Altria Group, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2017  , as stated in their report herein.
