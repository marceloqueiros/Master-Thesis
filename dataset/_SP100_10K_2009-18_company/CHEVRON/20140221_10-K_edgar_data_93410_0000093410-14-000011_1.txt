CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  FOR THE PURPOSE OF  SAFE HARBOR  PROVISIONS OF THE  PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995    

This   Annual Report on Form 10-K   of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking statements relating to Chevron s operations that are based on management s current expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries. Words such as  anticipates,   expects,   intends,   plans,   targets,   forecasts,   projects,   believes,   seeks,   schedules,   estimates,   budgets,   outlook  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the company s control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  
    
  Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological developments; the results of operations and financial condition of equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company s production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes, regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other pending or future litigation; the company s future acquisition or disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors set forth under the heading  Risk Factors  on pages 27 through 29 in this report. In addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

Summary Description of Chevron    
  Chevron Corporation,   *    a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, and power and energy services. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.  
         A list of the company s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-4. As of December 31,   2013  , Chevron had approximately 64,600 employees (including about 3,200 service station employees). Approximately 32,000 employees (including about 3,000 service station employees), or 50 percent, were employed in U.S. operations.  

Overview of Petroleum Industry    
    
  Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the world s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to  

other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.  
    
         Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets.  

Operating Environment    
    
  Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-8 of this Form 10-K in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company s current business environment and outlook. 
    
  Chevron s Strategic Direction    
    
  Chevron s primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the company s strategies are to grow profitably in core areas and build new legacy positions. In the downstream, the strategies are to deliver competitive returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to apply commercial excellence to enable the success of the upstream and downstream strategies, to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.  

___________________________________ 

* 
    Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term  Chevron  and such terms as  the company,   the corporation,   our,   we  and  us  may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include  affiliates  of Chevron   i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.

Description of Business and Properties 
  The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects* in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31,   2013  , and assets as of the end of   2013   and   2012     for the United States and the company s international geographic areas   are in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-35. Similar comparative data for the company s investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-37 through FS-39. 

Capital and Exploratory Expenditures    
    
  Total expenditures for   2013   were   $41.9 billion  , including   $2.7 billion   for the company s share of equity-affiliate expenditures. In   2012   and   2011  , expenditures were   $34.2 billion   and   $29.1 billion  , respectively, including the company s share of affiliates  expenditures of   $2.1 billion   in   2012   and   $1.7 billion   in   2011  .  
    
         Of the   $41.9 billion   in expenditures for   2013  ,   90 percent  , or   $37.9 billion  , was related to upstream activities. Approximately    89 percent   was expended for upstream operations in both   2012   and   2011  . International upstream accounted for about   78 percent   of the worldwide upstream investment in   2013  , about   72 percent   in   2012   and about   68 percent   in   2011  . These amounts exclude the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc. in 2011.  
    
         In   2014  , the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be $39.8 billion, including $4.8 billion of spending by affiliates. Approximately 90 percent of the total, or $35.8 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $27.9 billion, or about 78 percent, of this amount for projects outside the United States.  
    
         Refer also to a discussion of the company s capital and exploratory expenditures on page FS-  12.  

Upstream    
    
  The table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for   2013   and   2012   by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of   2.597 million   barrels per day in 2013 was essentially unchanged from   2012  . The benefits of lower maintenance-related downtime and higher reliability at the Tengizchevroil facilities in Kazakhstan, and ramp-ups at the Usan Project in Nigeria, in the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania and in the Delaware Basin in New Mexico were offset by normal field declines. Refer to the  Results of Operations  section beginning on page   FS-6   for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the   2011   through   2013   changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas.  
    
         The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in   2014   will be approximately   2.610 million   barrels per day based on an average Brent price of   $109   per barrel in   2013  . This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project start-ups and ramp-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. The longer-term outlook for production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Refer to the  Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,  beginning on page 9, for a discussion of the company s major crude oil and natural gas development projects. 

___________________________________ 
    
           * 
    As used in this report, the term  project  may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of the term  project  as it relates to any specific governmental law or regulation.

Average Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of Production    
    
  Refer to Table IV on page FS-64 for the company s average sales price per barrel of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and per thousand cubic feet of natural gas produced, and the average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  .  
      
  Gross and Net Productive Wells    
    
  The following table summarizes gross and net productive wells at year-end   2013   for the company and its affiliates:  
    
  Productive Oil and Gas Wells at December 31,   2013      

Reserves    
    
  Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-64 for a tabulation of the company s proved net crude oil and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of   2011   and each year-end from   2011   through   2013  . Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31,   2013  , are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations.     
         The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years   2011   through   2013   are shown in the following table.  
    
  Net Proved Reserves at December 31

Acreage    
    
  At December 31,   2013  , the company owned or had under lease or similar agreements undeveloped and developed crude oil and natural gas properties throughout the world. The geographical distribution of the company s acreage is shown in the following table.  
    
  Acreage at December 31,   2013      (Thousands of Acres)    

Delivery Commitments    
  The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below.  
         In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver to third parties 285 billion cubic feet of natural gas through   2016  . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments include a variety of pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts.  
    
         Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 871 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from   2014   through   2016   from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark, the Netherlands and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company s proved developed reserves in these countries.

Development Activities    
    
  Refer to Table I on page FS-59 for details associated with the company s development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  .     
         The following table summarizes the company s net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the company s development wells drilling at December 31,   2013  . A  development well  is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.

Exploration Activities    
    
  Refer to Table I on page FS-59 for detail on the company s exploration expenditures and costs of unproved property acquisitions for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  .  
         The following table summarizes the company s net interests in productive and dry exploratory wells completed in each of the last three years, and the number of exploratory wells drilling at December 31,   2013  .  Exploratory wells  are wells drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in unproved areas and include delineation and appraisal wells, which are wells drilled to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir beyond the proved area.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas    
    
  Chevron s   2013   key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page FS-6, are presented below. The comments include references to  total production  and  net production,  which are defined under  Production  in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-10.  
       The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production and for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment.

Downstream 
    
      Refining Operations 
  At the end of   2013  , the company had a refining network capable of processing nearly 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. Operable capacity at December 31,   2013  , and daily refinery inputs for   2011   through   2013   for the company and affiliate refineries are summarized in the table below.  
         Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during   2013   was 84 percent, compared with 88 percent in   2012  . At the U.S. refineries, crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged 81 percent in   2013  , compared with 87 percent in   2012  . Chevron processes both imported and domestic crude oil in its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for about 76 percent and 77 percent of Chevron s U.S. refinery inputs in   2013   and   2012  , respectively.  
         At the Pascagoula Refinery, construction progressed during 2013 on a facility to produce approximately 25,000 barrels per day of premium base oil. Mechanical completion of the plant is expected in first quarter 2014, and ramp up to full production is planned during second quarter 2014.  
         During 2013, work continued on projects to improve refinery flexibility and enhance the capability to process lower  

cost   feedstocks. In early 2013, start-up was achieved on a project at the Pascagoula Refinery that provides additional flexibility to process a broader range of crudes. A project to improve flexibility at the Salt Lake City Refinery is scheduled to be completed by mid-2014. 
         Outside the United States, GS Caltex, a 50 percent-owned affiliate, started commercial operations of a 53,000-barrel-per-day gas oil fluid catalytic cracking unit at the Yeosu Refinery in South Korea in second quarter 2013. In 2013, Caltex Australia Ltd., a 50 percent-owned affiliate, progressed its plans to convert the Kurnell, Australia, refinery to an import terminal in 2014. In February 2014, Singapore Refining Company, Chevron's 50 percent-owned joint venture, reached a final investment decision to install a gasoline clean fuels facility and cogeneration plant. Addition of the facilities is expected to increase the refinery's capability to produce higher value gasoline and improve energy efficiency.

       During 2013  , CPChem progressed construction of a 1-hexene plant at the company s Cedar Bayou complex in Baytown, Texas, with a design capacity of 250,000 metric tons per year. Start-up is expected in second quarter 2014. In October 2013, CPChem announced a final investment decision on its U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, which is expected to capitalize on advantaged feedstock sourced from shale gas development in North America. The $6 billion project includes an ethane cracker with an annual design capacity of 1.5 million metric tons of ethylene to be located at the Cedar Bayou complex in Baytown, Texas, and two polyethylene facilities to be located in Old Ocean, Texas, each with an annual design capacity of 500,000 metric tons. 
         Chevron s Oronite brand lubricant and fuel additives business is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of performance additives for lubricating oils and fuels. The company owns and operates facilities in Brazil, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States and has equity interests in facilities in India and Mexico. Oronite lubricant additives are blended with refined base oil to produce finished lubricants, used primarily in engine applications such as passenger cars, heavy-duty diesel trucks, buses, ships, locomotives and motorcycles. Additives for fuels are blended to improve engine performance and extend engine life. In 2013, construction continued on a project to expand the capacity of the existing additives plant on Jurong Island in Singapore. Commercial operations are expected to begin by third quarter 2014. Upon start-up, the plant is expected to double its capacity since it was commissioned in 1999. In Gonfreville, France, a project to expand dispersant production by more than 25 percent was completed in third quarter 2013, and a project to effectively double detergent capacity began construction with expected completion in late 2014.

         The company s U.S.-flagged fleet is engaged primarily in transporting refined products in the coastal waters of the United States. 
    
         The foreign-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Black Sea, South America, Mexico and West Africa to ports in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia. The company s foreign-flagged vessels also transport refined products and feedstocks to and from various locations worldwide. 
         In 2013, the company took delivery of two vessels that included one bareboat charter VLCC and a dynamically positioned shuttle tanker. Progress continued on contracts in place for bareboat charters and new builds, to modernize the fleet and increase LNG coverage. The company also owns a one-sixth interest in each of seven LNG carriers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf Venture in Australia. 
    
    Other Businesses    
    
    Mining:    Chevron owns and operates the Questa molybdenum mine in New Mexico. At year-end 2013, Chevron had 160 million pounds of proven molybdenum reserves at Questa. Production and underground development at Questa continued at reduced levels in 2013 in response to weak prices for molybdenum. 
    
    Power and Energy Services:     In 2014, Chevron Energy Solutions is being combined with Chevron Global Power Company. As the company's power and energy services provider, this business delivers comprehensive commercial, engineering and operational support services to improve power reliability and energy efficiency of Chevron operations worldwide. The responsibilities also include developing and building sustainable energy projects for the production of renewable power and to reduce energy costs that benefit third parties and the environment. 

26 

This business also manages Chevron's interest in a variety of gas-fired and renewable power generation assets. The gas-fired cogeneration facilities produce electricity and steam and utilize recovered waste heat to support enhanced oil recovery operations. The renewable facilities consist of wind, geothermal, photovoltaic and solar-to-steam production assets. 
         Chevron also has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the Philippines and is evaluating several advanced solar technologies for use in oil field operations as part of its renewable energy strategy. For additional information on the company s geothermal operations and renewable energy projects, refer to page 19 in the Upstream section and  Research and Technology  below. 
    
    Research and Technology:     The company s energy technology organization supports Chevron s upstream and downstream businesses by conducting research, developing and qualifying technology, providing technical services, and providing competency development in earth sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health, environment and safety disciplines. The information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, security and network technology to provide a standardized digital infrastructure and enable Chevron s global operations and business processes.

As of the end of   2013  , the ventures group continued to explore technologies such as next-generation biofuels, advanced solar and enhanced pipeline inspection methods, and made investments in the primary carbon market.  
         Chevron s research and development expenses were   $750 million,   $648 million and $627 million for the years   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively.  
         Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. 

Environmental Protection:     The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation.  

To complement the company s capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd. (OSRL), which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP). SWRP s objective is to further develop the industry s capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world.

             Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
     Chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures. Nevertheless, some inherent risks could materially impact the company s financial results of operations or financial condition.  
  Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices:     Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company s results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risk. Chevron accepts 

27 

the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. As such, an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. 
         During extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil, the company s upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected. Upstream assets may also become impaired. The impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales.  
  The scope of Chevron s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources:     The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the company s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.  
  The company s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors:   Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control, including hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.  
  The company s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight:   Chevron s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks.  

Chevron s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action:   The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.  
         For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, including information relating to Ecuador matters, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-39. 
  The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure:   The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition.  
  Political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm Chevron s business:   The company s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties.  
         In certain locations, governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on the company s operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, 

28 

acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company s operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. At December 31,   2013  , 21 percent of the company s net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan. The company also has significant interests in OPEC-member countries, including Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela, and in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Twenty-one percent of the company s net proved reserves, including affiliates, were located in OPEC countries at December 31,   2013  .  
  Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevron s operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron s products:     Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the company s operations and financial results.  
         International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, the company s activities in it and market conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the company s exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers  or customers  use of the company s products. Some of these activities, such as consumers  and customers  use of the company s products, as well as actions taken by the company s competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the company s control.  
         The effect of regulation on the company s financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the company s ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company s products. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for  

products the company currently sells and adversely affect the company s sales volumes, revenues and margins.  
  Changes in management s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period:     In preparing the company s periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the company s business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

  Certain Governmental Proceedings:    
         As initially disclosed in the first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicated that it would assess the company's Salt Lake City Refinery a civil penalty for alleged violations of federal requirements and Utah's air quality laws. These alleged violations were 

29 

the subject of an August 20, 2008, EPA Notice of Violation (NOV) for which no penalty was assessed at the time. On October 21, 2013, the U.S. District Court in Utah entered a Consent Decree resolving the NOV. Pursuant to the Consent Decree, Chevron paid a penalty of $384,000 and agreed to implement certain other measures. 
         On August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron U.S.A. Inc. refinery in Richmond, California. Various federal, state, and local agencies initiated investigations as a result of the incident. Based on its civil investigation, the United States EPA issued a Finding of Violations (FOV) to Chevron on December 17, 2013, which includes 62 findings of alleged noncompliance at the refinery. The majority of these findings relate to the August 2012 fire and alleged violations of chemical-accident-prevention laws, but the FOV also addresses a number of release-reporting issues, some of which are unrelated to the fire. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. 
         In July 2009, the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) alleged that Chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties in conjunction with commitments Chevron undertook to install and operate certain air emission control equipment at its Hawaii Refinery pursuant to a Clean Air Act settlement with the United States EPA and the DOH. The company has disputed many of the allegations. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. 
         As initially disclosed in the 2012 Form 10-K, in September and November 2012, Chevron's Richmond Refinery received from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) proposals to resolve 47 alleged NOVs related to air quality regulations. In December 2012, a settlement agreement was finalized covering 28 of those NOVs for payment of $145,600 in civil penalties. The company reached a settlement agreement with BAAQMD and paid $190,000 in civil penalties to resolve 17 of the remaining NOVs, and the BAAQMD has informed the company that it will not seek penalties for the last two remaining NOVs. 
         On June 10, 2013, the company received correspondence from the California Air Resources Board regarding an alleged violation of California's Regulation for the Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions based on alleged delay in the reporting of emissions data for Chevron's San Joaquin Valley Business Unit. Chevron has reached an agreement-in-principle with the California Air Resources Board under which the company would pay a $328,500 civil penalty to resolve the alleged violations. 
         The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has alleged that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported by Chevron s El Segundo Refinery for the 2011 calendar year contained an error in violation of California s GHG reporting regulation, and that the reporting error resulted in an over-allocation of GHG allowances. The company has reached an agreement-in- 

principle with the CARB under which Chevron would pay a $364,500 civil penalty to resolve the alleged violations. 
         As initially disclosed in the third quarter 2013 Form 10-Q, in July 2013, Chevron Products Company, a division of Chevron U.S.A. Inc., received a NOV from the CARB for the Richmond and Montebello (California) terminals alleging the selling or offering for sale of gasoline containing more than the maximum allowable ethanol content. Resolution of the alleged violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. 
         On October 18, 2013, the CARB issued a Notice of Violation alleging that Chevron s San Diego terminal sold gasoline with less than the required detergent content for 34 months from 2010 to 2012. Resolution of the alleged violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.  
         On December 18, 2013, EPA declared certain renewable fuel credits (also referred to as Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs) generated by E-Biofuel to be invalid. The company previously submitted RINs generated by E-Biofuel for 2012 compliance with federal renewable fuels requirements. Under current EPA policy, the company's earlier submittal of those now-invalid RINs generated by E-Biofuel may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.  
         As previously disclosed in the third quarter 2013 Form 10-Q, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. has participated in settlement discussions and received a proposed settlement agreement from the South Coast Air Quality Management District to resolve alleged violations of the El Segundo Refinery's Clean Air Act Title V Operating Permit. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. 
         The State of New Mexico provided to Chevron a NOV on December 11, 2013, alleging that the flaring of fuel gas that occurred during periodic compressor purging events at the Chevron Buckeye CO2 plant resulted in hourly air emissions during these events in excess of the plant permit limits and alleging that the company had failed to timely report these excess emissions. The resolution of this NOV may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. 
         As initially disclosed in the second quarter 2013 Form 10-Q, Chevron Pipe Line Company (CPL) received a NOV from the Utah Division of Water Quality (DWQ) in April 2013 alleging state law violations resulting from a pipeline spill near Willard Bay State Park, Utah. CPL has concluded a settlement agreement with the DWQ and the Utah Department of Natural Resources, State Parks and Recreation Division to resolve these alleged violations, which includes a monetary penalty of $350,000 as well as $5 million for environmentally beneficial mitigation projects and for lost use damages.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Key Financial Results    

Refer to the  Results of Operations  section beginning on page FS-6 for a discussion of financial results by major operating area for the three years ended   December 31, 2013  .  
    
    Business Environment and Outlook 
  Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chad, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of the Congo, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela, and Vietnam. 
  Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream business segments. The biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the company is the price of crude oil. In the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the company s quarterly earnings during the year.  

To sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the investment required. Identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in this effort. Projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments. 
  The company s operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the United States. From time to time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the company. Governments may attempt to do so in the future. Civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may impact the company s operations or investments. Those developments have at times significantly affected the company s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. 
  The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company s financial performance and growth. Refer to the  Results of Operations  section beginning on page FS-6 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during   2013  . Asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses. 
  The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning. 
  Comments related to earnings trends for the company s major business areas are as follows: 
    
  Upstream     Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the 

FS-2 

company s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations. 
  The company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. However, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company s control. External factors include not only the general level of inflation, but also commodity prices and prices charged by the industry s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. In recent years, Chevron and the oil and gas industry 
  generally experienced an increase in certain costs that 
  exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the 
  world. Capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest. 

The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $109 per barrel for the full-year   2013  , compared to $112 in   2012  . As of mid-February   2014  , the Brent price was $109 per barrel. The majority of the company s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The WTI price averaged $98 per barrel for the full-year   2013  , compared to $94 in   2012  . As of mid-February   2014  , the WTI price was $100 per barrel. WTI continued to trade at a discount to Brent in 2013 due to historically high inventories stemming from strong growth in domestic production and limitations on outbound pipeline capacity from the U.S. midcontinent. After narrowing during the first six months of 2013, the WTI discount slowly widened into  

the fourth quarter as seasonal refinery turnarounds contributed to surplus supply conditions for WTI, while Brent prices were supported by supply disruptions due to international events. 
  A differential in crude oil prices exists between high-quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). The amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude versus the demand, which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). During   2013  , the differential between North American light and heavy crude oil remained below historical norms due to growth in U.S. light sweet crude production in the midcontinent region and pipeline capacity constraints at Cushing. Outside of North America, the light-heavy crude differential narrowed modestly in 2013 as supply disruptions in key producing countries tightened light sweet crude markets and additional heavy crude oil conversion capacity came online.  
  Chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in California, Chad, Indonesia, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in Angola, China and the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. (See page FS-10 for the company s average U.S. and international crude oil realizations.) 
  In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $3.70 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during   2013  , compared with $2.71 during   2012  . As of mid-February   2014  , the Henry Hub spot price was $5.53 per

MCF. Fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the United States are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in North America. 
  Outside the United States, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. In some locations, Chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. International natural gas realizations averaged about $5.91 per MCF during   2013  , compared with $5.99 per MCF during   2012  . (See page FS-10 for the company s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.) 
  The company s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in   2013   averaged   2.597 million   barrels per day. About one-fifth of the company s net oil-equivalent production in   2013   occurred in the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Nigeria, Venezuela and the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. OPEC quotas had no effect on the company s net crude oil production in   2013   or   2012  . At their December 2013 meeting, members of OPEC supported maintaining the current production quota of 30 million barrels per day, which has been in effect since December 2008.  
  The company estimates that oil-equivalent production in   2014   will average approximately   2.610 million   barrels per day, based on an average Brent price of   $109   per barrel for the full-year   2013  . This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. A significant majority of Chevron s upstream investment is made outside the United States. 

Refer to the  Results of Operations  section on pages FS-6 through FS-8 for additional discussion of the company s upstream business. 
  Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-64 for a tabulation of the company s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of   2011   and each year-end from   2011   through   2013  , and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending   December 31, 2013  . 
  On November 7, 2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater Frade Field about 75 miles offshore Brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. The source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned. On March 14, 2012, the company identified a small, second seep in a different part of the field. No evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts  

FS-4 

related to these seeps have emerged. A Brazilian federal district prosecutor filed two civil lawsuits seeking $10.7 billion in damages for each of the two seeps. On October 1, 2013, the Court dismissed the two civil lawsuits and approved a settlement under which Chevron and its consortium partners agreed to spend approximately $43 million on social and environmental programs. On November 11, 2013, the Court announced that the settlement is final. The federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against Chevron and eleven Chevron employees. On February 19, 2013, the court dismissed the criminal matter, and on appeal, the appellate court reinstated two of the ten allegations, specifically those charges alleging environmental damage and failure to provide timely notification to authorities. The company is assessing its legal options. The company s ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable, but could be significant to net income in any one period.    
    
  Downstream   Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events. 
  Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets. 
  The company s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Asia and southern Africa. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. 
  Refer to the  Results of Operations  section on pages FS-6 through FS-8 for additional discussion of the company s downstream operations. 
    
  All Other     consists of mining operations, power and energy services, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, alternative fuels, and technology companies.

  Major Operating Areas     The following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the company s business segments   Upstream and Downstream   as well as for  All Other.  Earnings are also presented for the U.S. and international geographic areas of the Upstream and Downstream business segments. Refer to Note 11, beginning on page FS-35, for a discussion of the company s  reportable segments.  This section should also be read in conjunction with the discussion in  Business Environment and Outlook  on pages FS-2 through FS-5. 

U.S. Upstream    

U.S. upstream earnings of   $4.0 billion   in   2013   decreased   $1.3 billion   from   2012  , primarily due to higher operating, depreciation and exploration expenses of $420 million, $350 million, and $190 million, respectively, and lower crude oil production of $170 million. Higher natural gas realizations of approximately $200 million were mostly offset by lower crude oil realizations of $170 million. 
  U.S. upstream earnings of   $5.3 billion   in   2012   decreased   $1.2 billion   from   2011  , primarily due to lower natural gas and crude oil realizations of $340 million and $200 million, respectively, lower crude oil production of $240 million, and lower gains on asset sales of $180 million.  
  The company s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in   2013   was   $93.46   per barrel, compared with   $95.21   in   2012   and   $97.51   in   2011  . The average natural gas realization was   $3.37   per thousand cubic feet in   2013  , compared with   $2.64   and   $4.04   in   2012   and   2011  , respectively. 
  Net oil-equivalent production in   2013   averaged   657,000   barrels per day, essentially unchanged from   2012   and down   3 percent   from   2011  . Between   2013   and   2012  , new production in the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania and the Delaware Basin in New Mexico, along with the absence of weather-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, was largely offset by normal field declines. The decrease in production between   2012   and   2011   was associated with normal field declines and an absence of volumes associated with Cook Inlet, Alaska, assets sold in 2011. Partially offsetting this decrease was a ramp-up of projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Marcellus Shale and improved operational performance in the Gulf of Mexico. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for   2013   averaged   449,000   barrels per day, down   1 percent   from   2012   and   3 percent   from   2011  . Net natural gas production averaged about   1.2 billion   cubic feet per day in   2013  , up approximately   4 percent   from   2012   and down about   3 percent   from   2011  . Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table on page FS-10 for a three-year comparative of production volumes in the United States.  

FS-6 

International Upstream      

  International upstream earnings were   $16.8 billion   in   2013   compared with   $18.5 billion   in   2012  . The decrease was 
  mainly due to the absence of 2012 gains of approximately 
  $1.4 billion on an asset exchange in Australia and $600 
  million on the sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone 
  Project, lower crude oil prices of $500 million, and higher operating expense of $400 million. Partially offsetting these effects were lower income tax expenses of $430 million. Foreign currency effects increased earnings by   $559 million   in   2013  , compared with a decrease of   $275 million   a year earlier.  
  International upstream earnings were   $18.5 billion   in   2012   compared with   $18.3 billion   in   2011  . The increase was mainly due to the gain of approximately $1.4 billion on an asset exchange in Australia, higher natural gas realizations of about $610 million and the nearly $600 million gain on sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project. Mostly offsetting these effects were lower crude oil volumes of about $1.3 billion and higher exploration expenses of about $430 million. Foreign currency effects decreased earnings by   $275 million   in   2012  , compared with an increase of   $211 million   a year earlier.  
  The company s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in   2013   was   $100.26   per barrel, compared with   $101.88   in   2012   and   $101.53   in   2011  . The average natural gas realization was   $5.91   per thousand cubic feet in   2013  , compared with   $5.99   and   $5.39   in   2012   and   2011  , respectively.                 

International net oil-equivalent production of   1.94 million   barrels per day in   2013   decreased   1 percent   from   2012   and decreased about   3 percent   from   2011  . Project ramp-ups in Nigeria and Angola in 2013 were more than offset by normal field declines. The decline between   2012   and   2011   was a result of new production in Thailand and Nigeria in   2012   being more than offset by normal field declines, the shut-in of the Frade Field in Brazil and a major planned turnaround at Tengizchevroil. 
  The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was   1.3 million   barrels per day in   2013  , a decrease of approximately   2 percent   from   2012   and a decrease of approximately   7 percent   from   2011  . International net natural gas production of   3.9 billion   cubic feet per day in   2013   was up   2 percent   from   2012   and up   8 percent   from   2011  . 
  Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table, on page FS-10, for a three-year comparative of international production volumes.  
    
  U.S. Downstream    

U.S. downstream operations earned   $787 million   in   2013  , compared with   $2.0 billion   in   2012  . The decrease was mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales of $860 million and higher operating expenses of $600 million reflecting repair and maintenance activities at the company's refineries. The decrease was partially offset by higher earnings of $150 million from the 50 percent-owned CPChem. 
  U.S. downstream operations earned   $2.0 billion   in   2012  , compared with   $1.5 billion   in   2011  . The increase was mainly due to higher margins on refined products sales of $520 and higher earnings of $140 from CPChem. These benefits were partly offset by higher operating expenses of $130 million. 

FS-7 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Refined product sales of   1.18 million   barrels per day in   2013   declined   2 percent  , mainly reflecting lower gas oil, kerosene and gasoline sales. Sales volumes of refined products were   1.21 million   barrels per day in   2012  , a decrease of 4 percent from   2011  , mainly reflecting lower gasoline and fuel oil sales. U.S. branded gasoline sales of 517,000 barrels per day in   2013   were essentially unchanged from 2012 and   2011  .  
  Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table on page FS-10 for a three-year comparison of sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery input volumes. 

International Downstream    

International downstream earned   $1.5 billion   in   2013  , compared with   $2.3 billion   in   2012  . Earnings decreased due to lower gains on asset sales of $540 million and higher income tax expenses of $110 million. Foreign currency effects decreased earnings by   $76 million   in   2013  , compared to   $173 million   a year earlier.  
  International downstream earned   2.3 billion   in   2012  , compared with   $2.1 billion   in   2011  . Earnings increased due to a favorable change in effects on derivative instruments of $190 million and higher margins on refined product sales of $100 million. Foreign currency effects decreased earnings by   $173 million   in   2012  , compared with a decrease of   $65 million   a year earlier. 

Total refined product sales of   1.53   million barrels per day in 2013 declined 2 percent from 2012, mainly reflecting lower fuel oil and gasoline sales. Sales of 1.55 million barrels per day in 2012 declined 8 percent from 2011, primarily related to the third quarter 2011 sale of the company s refining and marketing assets in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Excluding the impact of 2011 asset sales, sales volumes were flat between the comparative periods.  

Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table, on page FS-10, for a three-year comparison of sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery input volumes. 
    
  All Other    

All Other includes mining operations, power and energy services, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, alternative fuels, and technology companies.  
  Net charges in   2013   decreased   $285 million   from   2012  , mainly due to lower corporate tax items and other corporate charges. 
  Net charges in   2012   increased   $426 million   from   2011  , mainly due to higher environmental reserves additions, corporate tax items and other corporate charges, partially offset by lower employee compensation and benefits expenses. 

FS-8 

Consolidated Statement of Income    
  Comparative amounts for certain income statement categories are shown below:   

Sales and other operating revenues decreased in   2013   mainly due to lower refined product prices and lower crude oil volumes and prices. The decrease between 2012 and 2011 was mainly due to the 2011 sale of the company s refining and marketing assets in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and lower crude oil volumes. 

Income from equity affiliates increased in   2013   from   2012   mainly due to higher upstream-related earnings from Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan and Petropiar in Venezuela, and higher earnings from CPChem, partially offset by 2013 impairments of power-related affiliates. 
  Income from equity affiliates decreased in   2012   from   2011   mainly due to lower upstream-related earnings from Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan as a result of lower crude oil production, and higher operating expenses at Angola LNG Limited and Petropiar in Venezuela. Downstream-related earnings were higher between comparative periods, primarily due to higher margins at CPChem. 
  Refer to Note 12, beginning on page FS-37, for a discussion of Chevron s investments in affiliated companies.  

Other income of   $1.2 billion   in   2013   included net gains from asset sales of $710 million before-tax. Other income in   2012   and   2011   included net gains from asset sales of $4.2 billion and $1.5 billion before-tax, respectively. Interest income was approximately $136 million in   2013  , $166 million in   2012   and $145 million in   2011  . Foreign currency effects increased other income by $103 million in   2013  , while decreasing other income by $207 million in   2012   and increasing other income by $103 million in   2011  .  

Crude oil and product purchases of   $134.7 billion   were down in   2013   mainly due to lower prices for refined products and lower volumes for crude oil, partially offset by higher refined product volumes. Crude oil and product purchases in   2012   decreased by $9.2 billion from the prior year mainly due to the 2011 sale of the company s refining and marketing assets in the United Kingdom and Ireland and lower natural gas prices.  

Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses increased   $1.8 billion   between   2013   and   2012     due to higher employee compensation and benefits costs   of $720 million, construction and   maintenance expenses of $590 million, and professional services costs   of $500 million. 
  Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses increased   $900 million   between   2012   and   2011   mainly due to higher contract labor and professional services of $590 million, and higher employee compensation and benefits of $280 million. 

Exploration expenses in   2013   increased from   2012   mainly due to higher charges for well write-offs. 
  Exploration expenses in   2012   increased from   2011   mainly due to higher geological and geophysical costs and well write-offs.      

The increase in   2013   from   2012   was mainly due to higher depreciation rates for certain oil and gas producing fields, higher upstream impairments and higher accretion expense, partially offset by lower production levels. The increase in   2012   from   2011   was mainly due to higher depreciation rates for certain oil and gas producing fields, partially offset by lower production levels. 

Taxes other than on income increased in   2013   from   2012   mainly due to the consolidation of the 64 percent-owned Star Petroleum Refining Company, beginning June 2012, and higher consumer excise taxes in the United States. Taxes other than on income decreased in   2012   from   2011   primarily due to lower import duties in the United Kingdom reflecting the sale of the company s refining and marketing assets in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2011. Partially offsetting the decrease were excise taxes associated with consolidation of Star Petroleum Refining Company beginning June 2012.  

FS-9 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Effective income tax rates were   40 percent   in   2013  ,   43 percent   in   2012   and   43 percent   in   2011  . The decrease in the effective tax rate between   2013   and   2012   was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in international upstream operations. The lower international upstream effective tax rate was driven by a greater portion of equity income in 2013 than in 2012 (equity income is included as part of before-tax income and is generally recorded net of income taxes) and foreign currency remeasurement impacts.  
  The rate was unchanged between   2012   and   2011  . The impact of lower effective tax rates in international upstream operations was offset by foreign currency remeasurement impacts between periods. For international upstream, the lower effective tax rates in the   2012   period were driven primarily by the effects of asset sales, one-time tax benefits and reduced withholding taxes, which were partially offset by a lower utilization of tax credits during the year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  Cash, Cash Equivalents, Time Deposits and Marketable Securities     Total balances were   $16.5 billion   and   $21.9 billion   at   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in   2013   was   $35.0 billion  , compared with   $38.8 billion   in   2012   and $41.1 billion in   2011  . Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $1.1 billion in   2013  , $2.8 billion in   2012  , and $3.5 billion in   2011  . 
  Restricted cash of   $1.2 billion   and   $1.5 billion   at   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as  Deferred charges and other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with tax payments, upstream abandonment activities, funds held in escrow for asset acquisitions and capital investment projects.  
  Dividends   Dividends paid to common stockholders were   $7.5   billion in   2013  ,   $6.8   billion in   2012   and $6.1 billion in   2011  . In April 2013, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 11.1 percent to $1.00 per common share.  
  Debt and Capital Lease Obligations     Total debt and capital lease obligations were   $20.4   billion at   December 31, 2013  , up from $12.2 billion at year-end   2012  .  
  The   $8.2   billion   increase   in total debt and capital lease obligations during   2013   included a $6 billion bond issuance in June 2013, timed in part to take advantage of historically low interest rates. The company s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $8.4 billion at   December 31, 2013  , compared with $6.0 billion at year-end   2012  . Of these amounts, $8.0 billion and $5.9 billion were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. At year-end   2013  , settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in   2014  , as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.  
  Chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in November 2015 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.  
  The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company s debt, and the company s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation and Texaco Capital Inc. All of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA by Standard   Poor s Corporation and Aa1 by Moody s Investors Service. The company s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard    

Poor s and P-l by Moody s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.  
  The company s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that  
  may be generated from asset dispositions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. The company also can modify capital spending plans during any extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the company s high-quality debt ratings.  
  Committed Credit Facilities   Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Short-Term Debt, beginning on page FS-45.   
  Common Stock Repurchase Program   In July 2010, the Board of Directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. The company expects to repurchase between $500 million and $2 billion of its common shares per quarter, at prevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors. During   2013  , the company purchased   41.6   million common shares for   $5.0   billion. From the inception of the program through   2013  , the company had purchased   139.3   million shares for    $15.0   billion.

Capital and Exploratory Expenditures    

1    Excludes the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc. in 2011. 
    
      Capital and Exploratory Expenditures   Total expenditures for   2013   were $  41.9   billion, including $  2.7   billion for the company s share of equity-affiliate expenditures, which did not require cash outlays by the company. In   2012   and   2011  , expenditures were $  34.2   billion and $  29.1   billion, respectively, including the company s share of affiliates  expenditures of $  2.1   billion and $  1.7   billion, respectively.   
  Expenditures for 2013 include approximately $4 billion for major resource acquisitions in Argentina, Australia, the Permian Basin and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, along with additional acreage in the Duvernay Shale and interests in the Kitimat LNG Project in Canada. In addition, work progressed on a number of major capital projects, particularly two Australian LNG projects and two deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. 
  Of the $  41.9   billion of expenditures in   2013  ,   90   percent, or $  37.9   billion, was related to upstream activities. Approximately,  

89   percent was expended for upstream operations in   2012   and   2011  . International upstream accounted for   78   percent of the worldwide upstream investment in   2013  ,   72   percent in   2012   and   68   percent in   2011  . These amounts exclude the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc. in 2011. 
  The company estimates that   2014   capital and exploratory expenditures will be $39.8 billion, including $4.8 billion of spending by affiliates. Approximately 90 percent of the total, or $35.8 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities. Approximately $27.9 billion, or 78 percent, of this amount is for projects outside the United States. Spending in   2014   is primarily focused on major development projects in Angola, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Russia, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Also included is funding for enhancing recovery and mitigating natural field declines for currently-producing assets, and for focused exploration and appraisal activities.  
  Worldwide downstream spending in   2014   is estimated at $3.1 billion, with $1.8 billion for projects in the United States. Major capital outlays include projects under construction at refineries in the United States and expansion of additives production capacity in Singapore. Additional investments are expected to be funded by CPChem for chemicals projects in the United States.  
  Investments in technology companies, power and energy services, and other corporate businesses in   2014   are budgeted at $1 billion.  
    
  Noncontrolling Interests   The company had noncontrolling interests of   $1.3 billion   at both December 31,   2013   and   2012  . Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled   $99 million   and   $41 million   in   2013   and   2012  , respectively.  
    
   Pension Obligations     Information related to pension plan contributions is included on page FS-53 in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading  Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.

Financial Ratios    
  Financial Ratios    

Current Ratio         current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end   2013  , the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $9.1 billion.  
  Interest Coverage Ratio         income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company s interest coverage ratio in   2013   was lower than   2012   and   2011   due to lower income.  
  Debt Ratio     total debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders' Equity, which indicates the company s leverage. The company's debt ratio in   2013   was higher than   2012   and   2011   due to higher debt, partially offset by a higher stockholders' equity balance. 
    
    Guarantees, Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations, and Other Contingencies    
  Direct Guarantees 

The company s guarantee of   $524 million   is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate   14  -year remaining term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this guarantee.  
  Indemnifications     Information related to indemnifications is included on page FS-55 in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading  Indemnifications.   
  Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements     The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers   

financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are:   2014     $4.2 billion;   2015     $4.5 billion;   2016     $3.2 billion;   2017     $2.6 billion;   2018     $2.2 billion; 2019 and after   $6.9 billion. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $3.6 billion in   2013  , $3.6 billion in   2012   and $6.6 billion in   2011  .  
  The following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations:

    Does not include amounts related to the company s income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. The company is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods in which these liabilities may become payable. The company does not expect settlement of such liabilities will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity in any single period. 
               3   
    $8.0 billion of short-term debt that the company expects to refinance is included in long-term debt. The repayment schedule above reflects the projected repayment of the entire amounts in the   2015     2016   period. 
               4   
    Does not include commodity purchase obligations that are not fixed or determinable. These obligations are generally monetized in a relatively short period of time through sales transactions or similar agreements with third parties. Examples include obligations to purchase LNG, regasified natural gas and refinery products at indexed prices. 
       Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk    
  The market risk associated with the company s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed on the next page. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A, of the company s   2013   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

FS-13 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Derivative Commodity Instruments   Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in   2013  .  
  The company s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company s risk management policies, which have been approved by the Audit Committee of the company s Board of Directors.  
  Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron s derivative commodity instruments in   2013   was not material to the company's results of operations.  
  The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method with a 95 percent confidence level as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. A one-day holding period is used on the assumption that market-risk positions can be liquidated or hedged within one day. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company's primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31,   2013   and   2012   was not material to the company's cash flows or results of operations.  

Foreign Currency     The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31,   2013  . 
  Interest Rates     The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end   2013  , the company had no interest rate swaps.  
    
    Transactions With Related Parties    
  Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to  Other Information  in Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, page FS-38, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

  Environmental     The following table displays the annual changes to the company s before-tax environmental remediation reserves, including those for federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws.  

FS-14 

The company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately   $14.3 billion   for asset retirement obligations at year-end   2013   related primarily to upstream properties.  
  For the company s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation.  
  Refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's   2013   environmental expenditures. Refer to Note 23 on pages FS-55 through FS-56 for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Note 24 on page FS-56 for additional discussion of the company's asset retirement obligations. 
  Suspended Wells   Information related to suspended wells is included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells, beginning on page FS-46. 
  Income Taxes   Information related to income tax contingencies is included on pages FS-43 through FS-45 in Note 15 and pages FS-54 through FS-55 in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading  Income Taxes.  
  Other Contingencies     Information related to other contingencies is included on page FS-56 in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading  Other Contingencies.   
    
    Environmental Matters    
  Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These regulatory requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Regulations intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change also continue to evolve and include those at the international or multinational (such as the mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union's Emissions Trading System), national (such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emission standards and renewable transportation fuel content requirements or domestic market-based programs such as those in effect in Australia and New Zealand), and state or regional (such as California's Global Warming Solutions Act) levels. 
  Most of the costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. It is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply with existing  

and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the company's liquidity or financial position. 
  Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. In addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards.  
  Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in   2013   at approximately $2.7 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $1.0 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.7 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites. 
  For   2014  , total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $1.1 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites. 
    
    Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions    
  Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. All such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.  

FS-15 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The discussion in this section of  critical  accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein:  
           1. 
    the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and 
              2. 
    the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company s financial condition or operating performance is material. 
     The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed  critical,  and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated  critical  estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows:  
  Oil and Gas Reserves   Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology and economic conditions.  
  The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron's Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following: 
           1. 
    Amortization - Proved reserves are used in amortizing capitalized costs related to oil and gas producing activities on the unit-of-production (UOP) method. Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a UOP basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During   2013  , Chevron's UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD A) for oil and gas properties was $11.6 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of   2013   were 4.8 billion barrels. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD A in   2013   would have increased by approximately   $600 million  . 
              2. 
    Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would  

trigger an impairment review. In assessing whether the property is impaired, the fair value of the property must be determined. Frequently, a discounted cash flow methodology is the best estimate of fair value. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see   Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates   below. 
  Refer to Table V,  Reserve Quantity Information,  beginning on page FS-64, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ending December 31,   2013  , and to Table VII,  Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves  on page FS-72 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31,   2013  .  
  This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-27, which includes a description of the  successful efforts  method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities. 
  Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates   The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.  
  Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on  

FS-16 

assumptions that are consistent with the company s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 9 beginning on page FS-33 and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," beginning on page FS-27. 
  No material individual impairments of PP E or Investments were recorded for the three years ending December 31,   2013  . A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company s PP E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired.  
  Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company s carrying value. When such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the difference between the investment s carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time.  
  In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee s financial performance, and the company s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s market value. Differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity analysis.  
  From time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets  associated carrying values.  
  Asset Retirement Obligations   In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for   2013   is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the  

number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 24 on page FS-56 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations. 
  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans    Note 21, beginning on page FS-48, includes information on the funded status of the company s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions. 
  The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the Company s processes to develop these assumptions is included on page FS-48 in Note 21 under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the world's financial markets. 
  For   2013  , the company used an expected long-term rate of return of   7.5   percent and a discount rate of   3.6   percent for U.S. pension plans. For the 10 years ending December 31,   2013  , actual asset returns averaged 6.4 percent for the plan. The actual return for   2013   was more than 7.5 percent and was associated with a continuing recovery in the financial markets during the year. Additionally, with the exception of two other years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded   7.5   percent. 
  Total pension expense for   2013   was   $1.3 billion  . An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 59 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for   2013   by approximately $85 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for   2013   by approximately $190 million.  
  The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31,   2013  , was a net liability of approximately   $2.4 billion  . An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31,   2013  , the company used a discount rate of  

FS-17 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

4.3   percent to measure the obligations for the U.S. pension plans. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 59 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $345 million, which would have increased the plan s overfunded status from approximately $0.4 billion to $0.7 billion.  
  For the company s OPEB plans, expense for   2013   was   $218 million  , and the total liability, which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of   2013  , was   $3.1 billion  . For the main U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a 3.9 percent discount rate to measure expense in   2013  , and a 4.7 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31,   2013  . Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on   2013   OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of   2013  . For information on the sensitivity of the health care cost-trend rate, refer to FS-51 in Note 21 under the heading  Other Benefit Assumptions.   
  Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page FS-50 in Note 21 for a description of the method used to amortize the   $5.2 billion   of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31,   2013  , and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during   2014  . In addition, information related to company contributions is included on Page FS-53 in Note 21 under the heading  Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.   
  Contingent Losses   Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.  
  Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as  Operating expenses  or  Selling, general and administrative expenses  on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is  more likely than not  (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 23 beginning on page FS-54. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31,   2013  .  
  An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not  

practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

Management s Responsibility for Financial Statements  
        
      To the Stockholders of Chevron Corporation 
  Management of Chevron is responsible for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related information appearing in this report. The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and fairly represent the transactions and financial position of the company. The financial statements include amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments.      As stated in its report included herein, the independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).      The Board of Directors of Chevron has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are not officers or employees of the company.

Both the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm have free and direct access to the Audit Committee without the presence of management. 
        
      Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
      The company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting based on the   Internal Control   Integrated Framework   (1992)     issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, the company s management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.       On May 14, 2013, COSO published an updated   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013) and related illustrative documents. As of December 31, 2013, the company is utilizing the original framework published in 1992. The transition period for adoption of the updated framework ends December 15, 2014.  
       The effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
                 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation: 
    evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  
       A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
       Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
      In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework   (1992)     issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis,

Note 1    
  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  General   Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations relate primarily to refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and additives for fuels and lubricant oils.  
       The company s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.  
    
  Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies   The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than   50   percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. As part of that accounting, the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the company s proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliate s equity currently in income.  
       Investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee s financial performance, and the company s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated   

recovery in the investment s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.  
        Differences between the company s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company s share of the affiliate s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate s historical book values.  
    
  Derivatives     The majority of the company s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.  
    
  Short-Term Investments   All short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the company s cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as  Cash equivalents.  Bank time deposits with maturities greater than   90   days are reported as  Time deposits.  The balance of short-term investments is reported as  Marketable securities  and is marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in  Other comprehensive income.   
    
  Inventories     Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market.  Materials, supplies and other  inventories generally are stated at average cost.

       Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued 

Properties, Plant and Equipment     The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 19, beginning on page FS-46, for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.  
       Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net before-tax cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net before-tax cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties in the United States, the company generally performs an impairment review on an individual field basis. Outside the United States, reviews are performed on a country, concession, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental  Depreciation, depletion and amortization  expense.  
       Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 9, beginning on page FS-32, relating to fair value measurements.  
       The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 24, on page FS-56, relating to AROs.  

Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Periodic valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.  
       The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets.  
       Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as  Other income.   
       Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.  
    
  Goodwill   Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.  
    
  Environmental Expenditures   Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.  
       Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For the company s U.S. and Canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future remediation commitment will be required. For crude oil, natural gas and  
  mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 24, on page FS-56, for a discussion of the company s AROs. 

FS-28 

Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued 

For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares.  
       The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.  
    
  Currency Translation   The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in  Currency translation adjustment  on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.  
    
  Revenue Recognition   Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. Revenues 
  from natural gas production from properties in which Chevron 

has an interest with other producers are generally recognized using the entitlement method. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. The associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the Consolidated Statement of Income, on page FS-22. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in  Purchased crude oil and products  on the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
    
  Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation     The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the company s Long-Term Incentive Plan have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The company amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line basis.

The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income. The term  earnings  is defined as  Net Income Attributable to Chevron Corporation.   
  Activity for the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011   is as follows:  

* Includes components of comprehensive income, which are disclosed  separately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

  Information Relating to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 

The    Net (increase) decrease in operating working capital    includes reductions of   $79  ,   $98   and   $121   for excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. These amounts are offset by an equal amount in    Net purchases of treasury shares  .  "Other" includes changes in postretirement benefits obligations and other long-term liabilities.  
       In February 2011, the company acquired Atlas Energy, Inc. (Atlas) for the aggregate purchase price of approximately   $4,500  . The purchase price included assumption of debt and certain payments noted below. The  Acquisition of Atlas Energy  reflects the   $3,009   cash paid for all the common shares of Atlas. An  Advance to Atlas Energy  of   $403   was made to facilitate the purchase of a   49 percent   interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream LLC on the day of closing. The  Repayments of long-term debt and other financing obligations  in 2011 includes   $761   for repayment of Atlas debt and   $271   for payoff of the Atlas revolving credit facility. The    Net (increase) decrease in operating working capital    includes   $184   for payments made in connection with Atlas equity awards subsequent to the acquisition. The remaining impacts of the acquisition did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  
      The    Net purchases of treasury shares    represents the cost of common shares acquired less the cost of shares issued for share-based compensation plans. Purchases totaled   $5,004  ,   $5,004   and   $4,262   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. In   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , the company purchased   41.6 million  ,   46.6 million   and   42.3 million   common shares for   $5,000  ,   $5,000   and   $4,250   under its ongoing share repurchase program, respectively.  
       In   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  ,    Net sales (purchases) of other short-term investments    generally consisted of restricted cash associated with tax payments, upstream abandonment activities, funds held in escrow for asset acquisitions and capital investment projects that was invested in cash and short-term securities and reclassified from  Cash and cash equivalents  to  Deferred charges and other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The company issued   $374   in   2011   of tax exempt bonds as a source of funds for U.S. refinery projects, which is included in  Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt.  
       The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes changes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet that did not affect cash. The 2012 period excludes the effects of   $800   of proceeds to be received in future periods for the sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project, of which   $82   was received in 2013. "Capital expenditures" in the 2012 period excludes a   $1,850   increase in "Properties, plant and equipment" related to an upstream asset exchange in Australia. Refer also to Note 24, on page FS-56, for a discussion of revisions to the company s AROs that also did not involve cash receipts or payments for the three years ending December 31,   2013  .

  Lease Commitments  
  Certain noncancelable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased assets are included as part of  Properties, plant and equipment, at cost  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such leasing arrangements involve crude oil production and processing equipment, service stations, bareboat charters, office buildings, and other facilities. Other leases are classified as operating leases and are not capitalized. The payments on operating leases are recorded as expense. Details of the capitalized leased assets are as follows:  

Rental expenses incurred for operating leases during   2013  ,   2012   and   2011   were as follows:  

Contingent rentals are based on factors other than the passage of time, principally sales volumes at leased service stations.  

Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rentals to reflect changes in price indices, renewal options ranging up to   25   years, and options to purchase the leased property during or at the end of the initial or renewal lease period for the fair market value or other specified amount at that time.  
       At December 31,   2013  , the estimated future minimum lease payments (net of noncancelable sublease rentals) under operating and capital leases, which at inception had a noncancelable term of more than one year, were as follows:  

Note 9    
  Fair Value Measurements  
  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are described as follows:  
  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. For the company, Level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are willing to transact at the exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively traded.  
  Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. For the company, Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained through third-party broker quotes and prices that can be corroborated with other observable inputs for substantially the complete term of a contract.  
  Level 3: Unobservable inputs. The company does not use Level 3 inputs for any of its recurring fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities.

  Marketable Securities   The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31,   2013  .  
    
  Derivatives     The company records its derivative instruments   other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale   on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options, and forward contracts, principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information.  

Properties, Plant and Equipment   The company did not have any material long-lived assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in   2013   or   2012  .  
    
  Investments and Advances   The company did not have any material investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in   2013   or   2012  .  
    
  Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value   The company holds cash equivalents and bank time deposits in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of   90   days or less and money market funds.  Cash and cash equivalents  had carrying/fair values of   $16,245   and   $20,939   at December 31,   2013  , and December 31,   2012  , respectively. The instruments held in  Time deposits  are bank time deposits with maturities greater than   90   days, and had carrying/fair values of   $8   and   $708   at December 31,   2013  , and December 31,   2012  , respectively. The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31,   2013  .

"Cash and cash equivalents  do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of   $1,210   and   $1,454   at December 31,   2013  , and December 31,   2012  , respectively. At December 31,   2013  , these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds related to tax payments and certain upstream abandonment activities which are reported in  Deferred charges and other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt of   $11,960   and   $6,086   at   December 31, 2013  , and   December 31, 2012  , had estimated fair values of   $12,267   and   $6,770  , respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is   $11,581   and classified as Level 1. The fair value of the other bonds is   $686   and classified as Level 2.    
       The carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31,   2013   and   2012  , were not material.  

Note 10  
  Financial and Derivative Instruments 
  Derivative Commodity Instruments   Chevron is exposed to market risks related to price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks.  
       The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. From time to time, the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes.  
       The company s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. None of the company s derivative instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the company s affiliates make such designation. The company s derivatives are not material to the company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities.  
  The company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the  over-the-counter  markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.  
       Derivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31,   2013  , December 31,   2012  , and December 31,   2011  , and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are as follows:

The table below represents gross and net derivative assets and liabilities subject to netting agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2013   and   December 31, 2012  . 
  Consolidated Balance Sheet: The Effect of Netting Derivative Assets and Liabilities 

Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for "a right of offset."   
    
    Concentrations of Credit Risk   The company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company s short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies limit the company s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company s counterparties in derivative instruments.  
       The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company s diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the company s broad customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral instruments to support sales to customers.  
    
    Note 11    
  Operating Segments and Geographic Data 
  Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into   two   business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company s  reportable segments  and  operating segments.  Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include  

mining operations, power and energy services, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, alternative fuels, and technology companies.  
       The segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes  segment managers  who report to the company s  chief operating decision maker  (CODM). The CODM is the company s Executive Committee (EXCOM), a committee of senior officers that includes the Chief Executive Officer, and EXCOM reports to the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation.  
       The operating segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.  
       Segment managers for the reportable segments are directly accountable to and maintain regular contact with the company s CODM to discuss the segment s operating activities and financial performance. The CODM approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment level, as well as reviews capital and exploratory funding for major projects and approves major changes to the annual capital and

       Note 11   Operating Segments and Geographic Data - Continued 

exploratory budgets. However, business-unit managers within the operating segments are directly responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and all other matters connected with daily operations. Company officers who are members of the EXCOM also have individual management responsibilities and participate in other committees for purposes other than acting as the CODM.  
       The company s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the company s operations are reported as "International  (outside the United States).  
    
  Segment Earnings     The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in  All Other.  Earnings by major operating area are presented in the following table:  

Segment Assets     Segment assets do not include intercompany investments or intercompany receivables. Segment assets at year-end   2013   and   2012   are as follows:  

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues     Operating segment sales and other operating revenues, including internal transfers, for the years   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , are presented in the table that follows. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices.  
       Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of additives for fuels and lubricant oils and the transportation and trading of refined products, crude oil and natural gas liquids.

Other Segment Information     Additional information for the segmentation of major equity affiliates is contained in Note 12. Information related to properties, plant and equipment by segment is contained in Note 13, on page FS-39.  

Note 12    
  Investments and Advances  
  Equity in earnings, together with investments in and advances to companies accounted for using the equity method and other investments accounted for at or below cost, is shown in the following table. For certain equity affiliates, Chevron pays its share of some income taxes directly. For such affiliates, the equity in earnings does not include these taxes, which are reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income as  Income tax expense.   

Descriptions of major affiliates, including significant differences between the company s carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows:  
  Tengizchevroil   Chevron has a   50 percent   equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which was formed in   1993   to develop the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan over a   40  -year period. At December 31,   2013  , the company s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about   $160   higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO s net assets. See Note 7, on page FS-32, for summarized financial information for   100 percent   of TCO.

       Note 12   Investments and Advances - Continued 

Petropiar   Chevron has a   30 percent   interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company formed in   2008   to operate the Hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project. The project, located in Venezuela s Orinoco Belt, has a   25  -year contract term. Prior to the formation of Petropiar, Chevron had a   30 percent   interest in the Hamaca project. At December 31,   2013  , the company s carrying value of its investment in Petropiar was approximately   $170   less than the amount of underlying equity in Petropiar s net assets. The difference represents the excess of Chevron s underlying equity in Petropiar s net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture.  
  Caspian Pipeline Consortium   Chevron has a   15 percent   interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a variable interest entity, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak. The company joined the consortium in   1997   and has investments and advances totaling   $1,298  , which includes long-term loans of   $1,251   at year-end   2013  . The loans were provided to fund   30 percent   of the initial pipeline construction. The company is not the primary beneficiary of the consortium because it does not direct activities of the consortium and only receives its proportionate share of the financial returns.  
  Petroboscan   Chevron has a   39 percent   interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company formed in   2006   to operate the Boscan Field in Venezuela until   2026  . Chevron previously operated the field under an operating service agreement. At December 31,   2013  , the company s carrying value of its investment in Petroboscan was approximately   $180   higher than the amount of underlying equity in Petroboscan s net assets. The difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by Chevron over its underlying equity in Petroboscan s net assets. In 2013, Chevron finalized a financial agreement with Petroboscan.     The financing, not to exceed   $2 billion  , will occur in stages over a   limited  

drawdown period set to expire on December 31, 2018. The loan will support a specific work program to maintain and increase production to an agreed-upon level. The terms are designed to support cash needs for ongoing operations and new development, as well as distributions. 
  Angola LNG Ltd.     Chevron has a   36 percent   interest in Angola LNG Ltd., which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.  
  GS Caltex Corporation     Chevron owns   50 percent   of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products and petrochemicals, predominantly in South Korea.  
  Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC   Chevron owns   50 percent   of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66.  
  Caltex Australia Ltd.     Chevron has a   50 percent   equity ownership interest in Caltex Australia Ltd. (CAL). The remaining   50 percent   of CAL is publicly owned. At December 31,   2013  , the fair value of Chevron s share of CAL common stock was approximately   $2,400  .  
  Other Information    Sales and other operating revenues  on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes   $14,635  ,   $17,356   and   $20,164   with affiliated companies for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively.  Purchased crude oil and products  includes   $7,063  ,   $6,634   and   $7,489   with affiliated companies for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively.  
        Accounts and notes receivable  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes   $1,328   and   $1,207   due from affiliated companies at December 31,   2013   and   2012  , respectively.  Accounts payable  includes   $466   and   $407   due to affiliated companies at December 31,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 

The following table provides summarized financial information on a   100 percent   basis for all equity affiliates as well as Chevron s total share, which includes Chevron's net loans to affiliates of   $1,129  ,   $1,494   and   $957   at December 31,   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively.

  Litigation  
  MTBE   Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to   ten   pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. The company s ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States.  
  Ecuador     Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil  

company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpet s ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a   three  -year remediation program at a cost of   $40  . After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations.  
       Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that Texpet s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuador s

       Note 14   Litigation - Continued 

failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and Petroecuador s further conduct since assuming full control over the operations.  
       In 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending that the court assess   $18,900  , which would, according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for Petroecuador. The engineer s report also asserted that an additional   $8,400   could be assessed against Chevron for unjust enrichment. In 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case was recused. In 2010, Chevron moved to strike the mining engineer s report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the United States indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineer s independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct. In August 2010, the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineer s report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within   45 days  . Chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement.  
       In September 2010, Chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should be assessed against it. The plaintiffs  submission, which relied in part on the mining engineer s report, took the position that damages are between approximately   $16,000   and   $76,000   and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately   $5,000   and   $38,000  . The next day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. Chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of Chevron s prior recusal petition, and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved. In October 2010, Chevron s motion to recuse the judge was granted. A new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judge s order closing the evidentiary phase of the case. On December 17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment.  
       On February 14, 2011, the provincial court in Lago Agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case. The court rejected     Chevron s defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion. The judgment assessed approximately   $8,600   in damages and approximately   $900   as an award for the plaintiffs  representatives. It also assessed an additional amount of approximately   $8,600   in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within   15 days   of the judgment, which Chevron did not do. On February 17, 2011, the plaintiffs appealed the judgment, seeking increased damages, and on March 11, 2011, Chevron appealed the judgment seeking to have the judgment  

nullified. On January 3, 2012, an appellate panel in the provincial court affirmed the February 14, 2011 decision and ordered that Chevron pay additional attorneys  fees in the amount of    0.10%   of the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment.  The plaintiffs filed a petition to clarify and amplify the appellate decision on January 6, 2012, and the court issued a ruling in response on January 13, 2012, purporting to clarify and amplify its January 3, 2012 ruling, which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately   $8,600   in punitive damages was within   15 days   of the clarification ruling, or February 3, 2012. Chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at trial. On January 20, 2012, Chevron appealed (called a petition for cassation) the appellate panel s decision to Ecuador s National Court of Justice. As part of the appeal, Chevron requested the suspension of any requirement that Chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement under Ecuadorian law of the judgment during the cassation appeal. On February 17, 2012, the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted Chevron s cassation appeal in a procedural step necessary for the National Court of Justice to hear the appeal. The provincial court appellate panel denied Chevron s request for a suspension of the requirement that Chevron post a bond and stated that it would not comply with the First and Second Interim Awards of the international arbitration tribunal discussed on the next page. On March 29, 2012, the matter was transferred from the provincial court to the National Court of Justice, and on November 22, 2012, the National Court agreed to hear Chevron's cassation appeal. On August 3, 2012, the provincial court in Lago Agrio approved a court-appointed liquidator s report on damages that calculated the total judgment in the case to be   $19,100  . On November 13, 2013, the National Court ratified the judgment but nullified the   $8,600   punitive damage assessment, resulting in a judgment of   $9,500  . On December 23, 2013, Chevron appealed the decision to the Ecuador Constitutional Court, Ecuador's highest court.

Note 14   Litigation - Continued 

On July 2, 2013, the provincial court in Lago Agrio issued an embargo order in Ecuador ordering that any funds to be paid by the Government of Ecuador to Chevron to satisfy a   $96   award issued in an unrelated action by an arbitral tribunal presiding in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law must be paid to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. The award was issued by the tribunal under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty in an action filed in 2006 in connection with seven breach of contract cases that Texpet filed against the Government of Ecuador between 1991 and 1993. The Government of Ecuador has appealed the tribunal's award. A Federal District Court for the District of Columbia confirmed the tribunal's award, and the Government of Ecuador has appealed the District Court's decision. 
       Chevron has no assets in Ecuador and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' lawyers have stated in press releases and through other media that they will seek to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in various countries and otherwise disrupt Chevron's operations. On May 30, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed an action against Chevron Corporation, Chevron Canada Limited, and Chevron Canada Finance Limited in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On May 1, 2013, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that the Court has jurisdiction over Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited for purposes of the action, but stayed the action due to the absence of evidence that Chevron Corporation has assets in Ontario. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed that decision. On December 17, 2013, the Court of Appeals for Ontario affirmed the lower court s decision on jurisdiction and set aside the stay,  allowing the recognition and enforcement action to be heard in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Chevron has appealed the decision concerning jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of Canada and, on January 16, 2014, the Court of Appeals for Ontario granted Chevron s motion to stay the recognition and enforcement proceeding pending a decision on the admissibility of the Supreme Court appeal. 
     On June 27, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed an action against Chevron Corporation in the Superior Court of Justice in Brasilia, Brazil, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On October 15, 2012, the provincial court in Lago Agrio issued an ex parte embargo order that purports to order the seizure of assets belonging to separate Chevron subsidiaries in Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia. On November 6, 2012, at the request of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, a court in Argentina issued a Freeze Order against Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and another Chevron subsidiary, Ingeniero Nortberto Priu, requiring shares of both companies to be "embargoed," requiring third parties to withhold   40 percent   of any payments due to Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and ordering banks to withhold   40 percent   of the funds in Chevron Argentina S.R.L. bank accounts. On December 14th, 2012, the Argentinean court rejected a motion to revoke the Freeze Order but modified it by ordering that third parties are not required to withhold funds but must report their payments. The court also clarified that the Freeze Order relating to bank accounts excludes taxes. On January 30, 2013, an appellate court upheld the Freeze Order, but on June 4, 2013 the Supreme Court of Argentina revoked the Freeze Order in its entirety. On December 12, 2013,  

the Lago Agrio plaintiffs served Chevron with notice of their filing of an enforcement proceeding in the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina. Chevron intends to vigorously defend against the proceeding. Chevron continues to believe the provincial court s judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in Ecuador, the United States and other countries. The company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence. Chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in Ecuador or any enforcement action. Chevron expects to continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability in the Ecuadorian courts and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions. 
       Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009 against the Republic of Ecuador before an arbitral tribunal presiding in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The claim alleges violations of the Republic of Ecuador s obligations under the United States Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet (described above), which are investment agreements protected by the BIT. Through the arbitration, Chevron and Texpet are seeking relief against the Republic of Ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation constitutes a violation of Ecuador s obligations under the BIT. On February 9, 2011, the Tribunal issued an Order for Interim Measures requiring the Republic of Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending further order of the Tribunal. On January 25, 2012, the Tribunal converted the Order for Interim Measures into an Interim Award. Chevron filed a renewed application for further interim measures on January 4, 2012, and the Republic of Ecuador opposed Chevron s application and requested that the existing Order for Interim Measures be vacated on January 9, 2012. On February 16,

2012, the Tribunal issued a Second Interim Award mandating that the Republic of Ecuador take all measures necessary (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and without Ecuador of the judgment against Chevron and, in particular, to preclude any certification by the Republic of Ecuador that would cause the judgment to be enforceable against Chevron. On February 27, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Third Interim Award confirming its jurisdiction to hear Chevron's arbitration claims. On February 7, 2013, the Tribunal issued its Fourth Interim Award in which it declared that the Republic of Ecuador  has violated the First and Second Interim Awards under the [BIT], the UNCITRAL Rules and international law in regard to the finalization and enforcement subject to execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and outside Ecuador, including (but not limited to) Canada, Brazil and Argentina.  The Tribunal has divided the merits phase of the proceeding into three phases. On September 17, 2013, the Tribunal issued its First Partial Award from Phase One, finding that the settlement agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet applied to Texpet and Chevron, released Texpet and Chevron from claims based on "collective" or "diffuse" rights arising from Texpet's operations in the former concession area and precluded third parties from asserting collective/diffuse rights environmental claims relating to Texpet's operations in the former concession area but did not preclude individual claims for personal harm. Chevron expects that the application of this ruling will be considered by the Tribunal in Phase Two, including a determination whether the claims of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are individual or collective/diffuse. The Tribunal had set Phase Two to begin on January 20, 2014 to hear Chevron's denial of justice claims, but on January 2, 2014, the Tribunal postponed Phase Two and held a procedural hearing on January 20-21, 2014. The Tribunal set a hearing on April 28-30, 2014 to address remaining issues relating to Phase One. It also set a hearing on April 20 to May 6, 2015 to address Phase Two issues. The Tribunal has not set a date for Phase Three, which will be the damages phase of the arbitration. 
       Through a series of U.S. court proceedings initiated by Chevron to obtain discovery relating to the Lago Agrio litigation and the BIT arbitration, Chevron obtained evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. In February 2011, Chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters, alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other state laws. Through the civil lawsuit, Chevron is seeking relief that includes a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. On March 7, 2011, the Federal District Court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending resolution of Chevron s civil lawsuit by the Federal District Court. On May 31, 2011, the Federal District Court severed claims   one  

through eight   of Chevron s complaint from the   ninth   claim for declaratory relief and imposed a discovery stay on claims one through eight pending a trial on the ninth claim for declaratory relief. On September 19, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction, stayed the trial on Chevron s ninth claim, a claim for declaratory relief, that had been set for November 14, 2011, and denied the defendants  mandamus petition to recuse the judge hearing the lawsuit. The Second Circuit issued its opinion on January 26, 2012 ordering the dismissal of Chevron s ninth claim for declaratory relief. On February 16, 2012, the Federal District Court lifted the stay on claims one through eight, and on October 18, 2012, the Federal District Court set a trial date of October 15, 2013. On March 22, 2013, Chevron settled its claims against Stratus Consulting, and on April 12, 2013 sworn declarations by representatives of Stratus Consulting were filed with the Court admitting their role and that of the plaintiffs' attorneys in drafting the environmental report of the mining engineer appointed by the provincial court in Lago Agrio. On September 26, 2013, the Second Circuit denied the defendants' Petition for Writ of Mandamus to recuse the judge hearing the case and to collaterally estop Chevron from seeking a declaration that the Lago Agrio judgment was obtained through fraud and other unlawful conduct. The trial commenced on October 15, 2013 and concluded on November 22, 2013. Post-trial briefing has concluded, but no decision has been rendered by the Federal District Court as of the date of this report. 
       The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects associated with the Ecuadorian judgment, the 2008 engineer s report on alleged damages and the September 2010 plaintiffs  submission on alleged damages, management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

  Taxes  
  Income Taxes 

In   2013  , before-tax income for U.S. operations, including related corporate and other charges, was   $4,672  , compared with before-tax income of   $8,456   and   $10,222   in   2012   and   2011  , respectively. For international operations, before-tax income was   $31,233  ,   $37,876   and   $37,412   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. U.S. federal income tax expense was reduced by   $175  ,   $165   and   $191   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively, for business tax credits.       The reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and the company s effective income tax rate is detailed in the following table:  

The company s effective tax rate decreased from   43.2 percent   in   2012   to   39.9 percent   in   2013  . The decrease was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in international upstream operations. The lower international upstream effective tax rate was driven by a greater portion of equity income in 2013 than in 2012 (equity income is included as part of before-tax income and is generally  

recorded net of income taxes) and foreign currency remeasurement impacts.  
       The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis and classifies those net amounts as current or noncurrent based on the balance sheet classification of the related assets or liabilities. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:  

Deferred tax liabilities at the end of   2013   increased by approximately   $1,600   from year-end   2012  . The increase was related to increased temporary differences for property, plant and equipment. Deferred tax assets were essentially unchanged between periods.  
       The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. It reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of   2013  , the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately   $3,064   and tax credit carryforwards of approximately   $1,301   primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from   2014   through   2029  . U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of   $11,572   will expire between   2014   and   2023  . 

FS-43 

At December 31,   2013   and   2012  , deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:  

Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately   $31,300   at December 31,   2013  . This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. At the end of   2013  , deferred income taxes were recorded for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations where indefinite reinvestment of the earnings is not planned. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.  
    
  Uncertain Income Tax Positions     The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management s assessment is that the position is  more likely than not  (i.e., a likelihood   greater than 50 percent  ) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term  tax position  in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods.  
       The following table indicates the changes to the company s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  . The term  unrecognized tax benefits  in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included.  

The increase in unrecognized tax benefits between December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2013 was primarily due to additions for refund claims to be filed with respect to prior years. 
       Approximately   71 percent   of the   $3,848   of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,   2013  , would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.  
       Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31,   2013  . For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States     2008  , Nigeria     2000  , Angola     2001  , Saudi Arabia     2009   and Kazakhstan     2007  .  
       The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next   12   months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.

The company completed its assessment of the potential impact of the August 2012 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that disallowed the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits claimed by an unrelated taxpayer. The findings of this assessment did not result in a material impact on the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
       On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as  Income tax expense.  As of December 31,   2013  , accruals of   $215   for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accruals of   $293   as of year-end   2012  . Income tax expense (benefit) associated with interest and penalties was   $(42)  ,   $145   and   $(64)   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively.

  Short-Term Debt    

Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date.  
       The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31,   2013  , the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt.  
       At December 31,   2013  , the company had   $8,000   in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in   December 2016  , that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding     under these facilities at December 31,   2013  .  
       At December 31,   2013   and   2012  , the company classified   $8,000   and   $5,900  , respectively, of short-term debt as long-term. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.

  New Accounting Standards 
  Income Taxes (Topic 740), Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11)   In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, which became effective for the company January 1, 2014. The standard provides that a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit should be offset against a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward if such settlement is required or expected in the event the uncertain tax position is disallowed. Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a significant effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

  Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells    
  The company continues to capitalize exploratory well cost after the completion of drilling when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and (b) the entity is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if an enterprise obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. (Note that an entity is not required to complete the exploratory well as a producing well.) The accounting standards provide a number of indicators that can assist an entity in demonstrating that sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the project.  
       The following table indicates the changes to the company s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31,   2013  :

Note 19   Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells - Continued 

The following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling.  

* 
    Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both. 
          Of the   $2,604   of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31,   2013  ,   $1,733   (  22   projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities under way or firmly planned for the near future. The   $871   balance is related to   29   projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not under way or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development. 
       The projects for the   $871   referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects  economic viability: (a)   $382   (  six   projects)   undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within   three years  ; (b)   $47   (  two   projects)   development concept under review by government; (c)   $384   (  nine   projects)   development alternatives under review; (d)   $58   (  twelve   projects)   miscellaneous activities for projects with smaller amounts suspended. While progress was being made on all   51   projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations connected with the projects. Approximately half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next   three years  .  
       The   $2,604   of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31,   2013  , represents   191   exploratory wells in   51   projects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis:  

Note 20    
  Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation  
  Compensation expense for stock options for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011   was   $292   (  $190   after tax),   $283   (  $184   after tax) and   $265   (  $172   after tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance units and restricted stock units was   $223   (  $145   after tax),   $177   (  $115   after tax) and   $214   (  $139   after tax) for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at   December 31, 2013  , or December 31,   2012  .  
       Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011   was   $553  ,   $753   and   $948  , respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were   $73  ,   $101   and   $121   for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively.  
       Cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was   $186  ,   $123   and   $151   for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively.  
    
  Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)   Awards under the LTIP may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May 2023, no more than   260 million   shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than   50 million   of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards outstanding as of   December 31, 2013  , the contractual terms vary between   three   years for the performance units and   10   years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights.

Unocal Share-Based Plans (Unocal Plans)     When Chevron acquired Unocal in August 2005, outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various Unocal Plans were exchanged for fully vested Chevron options and appreciation rights. These awards retained the same provisions as the original Unocal Plans. Unexercised awards began expiring in early 2010 and will continue to expire through early 2015. 
       The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011   were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions:  

1   
    Expected term is based on historical exercise and postvesting cancellation data. 
               2   
    Volatility rate is based on historical stock prices over an appropriate period, generally equal to the expected term. 

A summary of option activity during   2013   is presented below:  

The total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market price) of options exercised during   2013  ,   2012   and   2011   was   $445  ,   $580   and   $668  , respectively. During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these awards.  

As of   December 31, 2013  , there was   $259   of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based 
  compensation arrangements granted under the plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.7   years. 
       At January 1,   2013  , the number of LTIP performance units outstanding was equivalent to   2,827,757   shares. During   2013  ,   776,180   units were granted,   1,007,952   units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and   64,715   units were forfeited. At   December 31, 2013  , units outstanding were   2,531,270  , and the fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was   $312   measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method. In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under various LTIP and former Unocal programs totaled approximately   2.9 million   equivalent shares as of   December 31, 2013  . A liability of   $107   was recorded for these awards.  
    
    Note 21    
  Employee Benefit Plans    
  The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company s other investment alternatives.  
       The company also sponsors other postretirement (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. Medical coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees in the company s main U.S. medical plan is secondary to Medicare (including Part D) and the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than   4 percent   each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.  
       The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Net actuarial losses recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  at   December 31, 2013  , for the company s U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans are being amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately   10  ,   12   and   10   years, respectively. These amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed   10 percent   of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. During   2014  , the company estimates actuarial losses of   $209  ,   $102   and   $7   will be amortized from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans,  

respectively. In addition, the company estimates an additional   $132   will be recognized from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  during   2014   related to lump-sum settlement costs from U.S. pension plans.  
       The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  at   December 31, 2013  , was approximately   10   and   12   years for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, and   10   years for other postretirement benefit plans. During   2014  , the company estimates prior service (credits) costs of   $(9)  ,   $21   and   $14   will be amortized from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively.

Assumptions   The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended December 31:  

Expected Return on Plan Assets   The company s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the company s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.  
       For   2013  , the company used an expected long-term rate of return of   7.5 percent   for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for   71 percent   of the company s pension plan assets. In   2012   and   2011  , the company used a long-term rate of return of   7.5   and 7.8 percent, respectively for this plan.  
       The market-related value of assets of the major U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the   three   months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the   three  -month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.  
    
  Discount Rate   The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company's plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. At   December 31, 2013  , the company used a   4.3 percent   discount rate for the U.S. pension plans and   4.7 percent   for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates at the end of   2012   and   2011   were   3.6   and   3.9 percent   and   3.8   and   4.0 percent   for the U.S. pension plans and the main U.S. OPEB plans, respectively. 
    
  Other Benefit Assumptions   For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at   December 31, 2013  , for the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with   7.3 percent   in   2014   and gradually decline to   4.5 percent   for   2025   and beyond. For this measurement at   December 31, 2012  , the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with   7.5 percent   in   2013   and gradually declined to   4.5  

percent   for   2025   and beyond. In both measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at   4 percent  .  
       Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs. The impact is mitigated by the   4 percent   cap on the company s medical contributions for the primary U.S. plan. A 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans:

Plan Assets and Investment Strategy   The fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value the pension assets is divided into three levels:  
       Level 1: Fair values of these assets are measured using unadjusted quoted prices for the assets or the prices of identical assets in active markets that the plans have the ability to access.  
       Level 2: Fair values of these assets are measured based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means. If  

FS-51 

Note 21   Employee Benefit Plans - Continued 

the asset has a contractual term, the Level 2 input is observable for substantially the full term of the asset. The fair values for Level 2 assets are generally obtained from third-party broker quotes, independent pricing services and exchanges. 

Level 3: Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable for these assets. Valuation may be performed using a financial model with estimated inputs entered into the model.  
       The fair value measurements of the company s pension plans for   2013   and   2012   are below: 

2   
    Collective Trusts/Mutual Funds for U.S. plans are entirely index funds; for International plans, they are mostly index funds. For these index funds, the Level 2 designation is partially based on the restriction that advance notification of redemptions, typically two business days, is required. 
               3   
    Mixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixed-income instruments in order to diversify and lower risk. 
               4   
    The year-end valuations of the U.S. real estate assets are based on internal appraisals by the real estate managers, which are updates of third-party appraisals that occur at least once a year for each property in the portfolio. 
               5   
    The  Other  asset class includes net payables for securities purchased but not yet settled (Level 1); dividends and interest- and tax-related receivables (Level 2); insurance contracts and investments in private-equity limited partnerships (Level 3).

       Note 21   Employee Benefit Plans - Continued 

The effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in Level 3 plan assets are outlined below:  

The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management.  
       The company s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise   88 percent   of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans  investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.  
       For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company's Benefit Plan Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities   40     70 percent  , Fixed Income and Cash   20     60 percent  , Real Estate   0     15 percent  , and Other   0     5 percent  . For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines, which are reviewed regularly: Equities   40  -  60   percent, Fixed Income and Cash   25     50 percent   and Real Estate   5  -  15   percent. The other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset class risk. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds.  
       The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.  
    
  Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments   In   2013  , the company contributed   $819   and   $375   to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In   2014  , the company expects contributions to be approximately   $350   to its U.S. plan and   $350   to its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. Additional funding may  

ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.  
       The company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately   $215   in   2014  , compared with   $205   paid in   2013  .  
       The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years:  

Employee Savings Investment Plan   Eligible employees of Chevron and certain of its subsidiaries participate in the Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP).  
       Charges to expense for the ESIP represent the company s contributions to the plan, which are funded either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the release of common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (LESOP), which is described in the section that follows. Total company matching contributions to employee accounts within the ESIP were   $303  ,   $286   and   $263   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. This cost was reduced by the value of shares released from the LESOP totaling   $140  ,   $43   and   $38   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. The remaining amounts, totaling   $163  ,   $243    

FS-53 

Note 21   Employee Benefit Plans - Continued 

and   $225   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively, represent open market purchases.  
    
  Employee Stock Ownership Plan     Within the Chevron ESIP is an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). In 1989, Chevron established a LESOP as a constituent part of the ESOP. The LESOP provides partial prefunding of the company s future commitments to the ESIP. The debt associated with the LESOP was retired in 2013 and the remaining unallocated shares were distributed to ESIP participants during the year. 
       The company reported compensation expense equal to LESOP debt principal repayments less dividends received and used by the LESOP for debt service. Interest accrued on LESOP debt was recorded as interest expense. Dividends paid on LESOP shares were reflected as a reduction of retained earnings. All LESOP shares were considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations.  
       Total expenses (credits) for the LESOP were   $5  ,   $1   and   $(1)   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. The net expense (credit) for the respective years were composed of compensation expenses (credits) of   $4      $(2)   and   $(5)   and charges to interest expense for LESOP debt of   $1  ,   $3   and   $4  .  
       Of the dividends paid on the LESOP shares,   $38  ,   $18   and   $18   were used in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively, to service LESOP debt. The company also contributed $  7   and $  2   in 2013 and 2012, respectively, to satisfy LESOP debt service. No company contributions were required in 2011, as dividends received by the LESOP were sufficient to satisfy LESOP debt service.  
       Shares held in the LESOP were released and allocated to the accounts of ESIP participants based on debt service deemed to be paid in the year in proportion to the total of current-year and remaining debt service. LESOP shares as of   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , were as follows:  

Benefit Plan Trusts   Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end   2013  , the trust contained   14.2 million   shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.  
       Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , trust assets of   $40   and   $48  , respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts.  

Employee Incentive Plans   The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were   $871  ,   $898   and   $1,217   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in Note 20, beginning on page FS-47.

  Equity  
  Retained earnings at December 31,   2013   and   2012  , included approximately   $11,395   and   $10,119  , respectively, for the company s share of undistributed earnings of equity affiliates.  
       At December 31,   2013  , about   143 million   shares of Chevron s common stock remained available for issuance from the   260 million   shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron LTIP. In addition, approximately   204,000   shares remain available for issuance from the   800,000   shares of the company s common stock that were reserved for awards under the Chevron Corporation Non-Employee Directors  Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan.  
    
    Note 23    
  Other Contingencies and Commitments  
    Income Taxes   The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 15, beginning on page FS-43, for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As discussed on page FS-45, Chevron completed its assessment of the potential impact of the August 2012 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that disallowed the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits claimed by an unrelated taxpayer. The findings of this assessment did not result in a  

FS-54 

Note 23   Other Contingencies and Commitments - Continued 

material impact on the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
    
    Guarantees     The company s guarantee of   $524   is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate     14  -year remaining term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this guarantee.  
    
    Indemnifications   In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of   $200  , which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the   $200   obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997.  
       Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.  
    
    Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements     The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers  financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are:   2014       $4,200  ;   2015       $4,500  ;   2016       $3,200  ;   2017       $2,600  ;   2018       $2,200  ; 2019 and after     $6,900  . A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately   $3,600   in   2013  ,   $3,600   in   2012   and   $6,600   in   2011  .  
    
    Environmental   The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether operating, closed or  

divested. These future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.  
       Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant impact on the company s competitive position relative to other U.S. or international petroleum or chemical companies.  
       Chevron s environmental reserve as of   December 31, 2013  , was   $1,456  . Included in this balance were remediation activities at approximately   174   sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws. The company s remediation reserve for these sites at year-end   2013   was   $179  . The federal Superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by the EPA or other regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties  costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.  
       Of the remaining year-end   2013   environmental reserves balance of   $1,277  ,   $834   related to the company s U.S. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals), chemical facilities, and pipelines. The remaining   $443   was associated with various sites in international downstream   $79  , upstream   $313   and other businesses   $51  . Liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the company s plans and activities to  

FS-55 

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements           Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts 
    
       Note 23   Other Contingencies and Commitments - Continued 

remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. These and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.  
       The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end   2013   had a recorded liability that was material to the company s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.  
       It is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.  
       Refer to Note 24 for a discussion of the company s asset retirement obligations.  
    
    Other Contingencies   On April 26, 2010, a California appeals court issued a ruling related to the adequacy of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) supporting the issuance of certain permits by the city of Richmond, California, to replace and upgrade certain facilities at Chevron s refinery in Richmond. Settlement discussions with plaintiffs in the case ended late fourth quarter 2010, and on March 3, 2011, the trial court entered a final judgment and peremptory writ ordering the City to set aside the project EIR and conditional use permits and enjoining Chevron from any further work. On May 23, 2011, the company filed an application with the City Planning Department for a conditional use permit for a revised project to complete construction of the hydrogen plant, certain sulfur removal facilities and related infrastructure. On June 10, 2011, the City published its Notice of Preparation of the revised EIR for the project. The revised and recirculated EIR is intended to comply with the appeals court decision. Management believes the outcomes associated with the project are uncertain. Due to the uncertainty of the company s future course of action, or potential outcomes of any action or combination of actions, management does not believe an estimate of the financial effects, if any, can be made at this time. 
       Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve.  
       The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.  

Note 24    
  Asset Retirement Obligations  
  The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) as an asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the company s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates.  
       AROs are primarily recorded for the company s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation.  
       The following table indicates the changes to the company s before-tax asset retirement obligations in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  :  

In the table above, the amounts associated with "Revisions in estimated cash flows" reflect increasing cost estimates to abandon wells, equipment and facilities.  
       The long-term portion of the   $14,298   balance at the end of   2013     was   $13,476  .

  Earnings in   2013   included after-tax gains of approximately   $500   relating to the sale of nonstrategic properties. Of this amount, approximately   $300   and $  200   related to downstream and upstream  assets, respectively. Earnings in   2012   included after-tax gains of approximately   $2,800   relating to the sale of nonstrategic properties. Of this amount, approximately   $2,200   and $  600   related to upstream and downstream assets, respectively.  
       Other financial information is as follows:  

The excess of replacement cost over the carrying value of inventories for which the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method is used was   $9,150   and   $9,292   at December 31,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. Replacement cost is generally based on average acquisition costs for the year. LIFO profits (charges) of   $14  ,   $121   and   $193   were included in earnings for the years   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively.  

The company has   $4,639   in goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to the 2005 acquisition of Unocal and to the 2011 acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc. The company tested this goodwill for impairment during   2013   and concluded no impairment was necessary.

  Assets Held For Sale 
  At December 31, 2013, the company classified   $580   of net properties, plant and equipment as  Assets held for sale  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are associated with upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in 2014. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2013 were not material.

Table V   Reserve Quantity Information  

Summary of Net Oil and Gas Reserves    

Reserves Governance     The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting   three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. The potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.  
       Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate. 

Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. 
       Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. 
       Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the Manager of Corporate Reserves, a corporate department that reports directly to the Vice Chairman responsible for the company s worldwide exploration and production activities. The Manager of Corporate Reserves has more than 30 years  experience working in the oil and gas industry and a Master of Science in Petroleum Engineering degree from Stanford University. His experience includes  

FS-64 

                              Table V   Reserve Quantity Information - Continued 

more than 15 years of managing oil and gas reserves processes. He was chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee, served on the United Nations Expert Group on Resources Classification, and is a past member of the Joint Committee on Reserves Evaluator Training and the California Conservation Committee. He is an active member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and serves on the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. 
       All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are  
  knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates. The reserves activities are managed by two operating company-level reserves managers. These two reserves managers are not members of the RAC so as to preserve corporate-level independence. 
       The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units  recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the   Corporate Reserves Manual,   which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.  
       During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company s Strategy and Planning Committee, whose members include the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board. 
       RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the   Corporate Reserves Manual. 

Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions    In   2013  , additions to Chevron s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide  reasonably certain  proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the  past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates. 
         Proved Undeveloped Reserve Quantities   At the end of   2013  , proved undeveloped reserves totaled 5.1 billion barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE), a decrease of 56 million BOE from year-end 2012. The decrease was due to the transfer of 461 million BOE to proved developed, partially offset by increases of 210 BOE in extensions and discoveries, 7 million BOE in purchases, 42 million BOE in improved recovery and 146 million BOE in revisions. 
        Investment to Convert Proved Undeveloped to Proved Developed Reserves     During   2013  , investments totaling approximately $17.4 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $3.4 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. Australia accounted for $9.6 billion of the total, mainly for development and construction activities at the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects. Expenditures of about $3.5 billion in the United States related primarily to various development activities in the Gulf of Mexico and the midcontinent region. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled $3.0 billion, primarily related to development projects in Thailand, Indonesia and with the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. In Africa, about $2.9 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola.  
         Proved Undeveloped Reserves for Five Years or More        Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.  

FS-65 

                              Table V   Reserve Quantity Information - Continued 

At year-end   2013  , the company held approximately 1.6 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The reserves are held by consolidated and affiliated companies and the majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. 
       In Africa, the majority of the approximately 300 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more is related to deepwater and natural gas developments in Nigeria. Major Nigerian deepwater development projects include Agbami, which started production in 2008 and has ongoing development activities to maintain full utilization of infrastructure capacity, and the Usan development, which started production in 2012. Also in Nigeria, various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects are currently under development. 
       In Asia, less than 200 million BOE remain classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years. The majority relate to ongoing development activities in the Pattani Field in Thailand and the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli fields in Azerbaijan.  
       Affiliates account for 1.1 billion barrels of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more, with the majority related to the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion. In Venezuela, development drilling continues at Hamaca to optimize utilization of upgrader capacity. 
       Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. For   2013  , this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 44 percent and 46 percent. The consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period.  

Proved Reserve Quantities   At   December 31, 2013  , proved reserves for the company were 11.2 billion BOE. Approximately 18 percent of the total reserves were located in the United States.  
       Aside from the TCO affiliate's Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan, no single property accounted for more than 5 percent of the company s total oil-equivalent proved reserves. About 18 other individual properties in the company s portfolio of assets each contained between 1 percent and 5 percent of the company s oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in the aggregate accounted for 44 percent of the company s total oil-equivalent proved reserves. These properties were geographically dispersed, located in the United States, Canada, South America, Africa, Asia and Australia.  
       In the United States, total proved reserves at year-end   2013   were 2.0 billion BOE. California properties accounted for 30 percent of the U.S. reserves, with most classified as heavy oil. Because of heavy oil s high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced recovery methods, most of the company s heavy oil fields in California employ a continuous steamflooding process. The Gulf of Mexico region contains 26 percent of the U.S. reserves and production operations are mostly offshore. Other U.S. areas represent the remaining 44 percent of U.S. reserves. For production of crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including waterflooding and CO   2    injection. 
  For the three years ending   December 31, 2013  , the pattern of net 
  reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by, among other things, events and circumstances that are outside the company s control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest. 
  The company s estimated net proved reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil and changes thereto for the years   2011  ,   2012   and   2013   are shown in the table on page FS-67. The company s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page FS-68.

      Noteworthy amounts in the categories of liquids proved reserve changes for   2011   through   2013   are discussed below:  
  Revisions   In 2011, net revisions increased reserves 235 million barrels. For consolidated companies, improved reservoir performance accounted for a majority of the 63 million barrel increase in the United States. In Africa, improved field performance drove the 60 million barrel increase. In Asia, increases from improved reservoir performance were partially offset by the effects of higher prices on entitlement volumes. Synthetic oil reserves in Canada increased by 32 million barrels, primarily due to geotechnical revisions. For affiliated companies, improved facility and reservoir performance was partially offset by the price effect on entitlement volumes at TCO. 
  In 2012, net revisions increased reserves 390 million barrels. Improved field performance and drilling associated with Gulf of Mexico projects accounted for the majority of the 104 million barrel increase in the United States. In Asia, drilling results across numerous assets drove the 97 million barrel increase. Improved field performance from various Nigeria and Angola producing assets was primarily responsible for the 66 million barrel increase  

in Africa. Improved plant efficiency for the TCO affiliate was responsible for a large portion of the 59 million barrel increase.    
  In 2013, net revisions increased reserves 354 million barrels. Improved field performance from various Nigeria and Angola producing assets was primarily responsible for the 94 million barrel increase in Africa.  In Asia, drilling performance across numerous assets resulted in an 84 million barrel increase.  Improved field performance and drilling associated with Gulf of Mexico projects and drilling in the Midland and Delaware basins accounted for the majority of the 55 million barrel increase in the United States. Synthetic oil reserves in Canada increased by 40 million barrels, primarily due to improved field performance. 
  Improved Recovery   In 2011, improved recovery increased volumes by 58 million barrels. Reserves in Africa increased 48 million barrels due primarily to secondary recovery performance in Nigeria. 
  In 2012, improved recovery increased reserves by 77 million barrels, primarily due to secondary recovery performance in Africa and in Gulf of Mexico fields in the United States. 

FS-67 

                            Table V   Reserve Quantity Information - Continued 

In 2013, improved recovery increased reserves by 57 million barrels due to numerous small projects, including expansions of existing projects in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa.       Extensions and Discoveries   In 2011, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 299 million barrels. In the United States, additions related to two Gulf of Mexico projects resulted in the majority of the 140 million barrel increase. In Australia, the Wheatstone Project increased liquid volumes 65 million barrels. Africa and Other Americas increased reserves 34 million and 30 million barrels, respectively, following the start of new projects in these areas. In Europe, a  project in the United Kingdom increased reserves 26 million barrels. 
      In 2012, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 218 million barrels. In Other Americas, extensions and discoveries  

increased reserves 101 million barrels, primarily due to the initial booking of the Hebron project in Canada. In the United States, additions at several Gulf of Mexico projects and drilling activities in the mid-continent region were primarily responsible for the 77 million barrel increase. 
  In 2013, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 78 million barrels. In the United States, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 55 million barrel increase.    
  Purchases   In 2011, purchases increased worldwide liquid volumes 42 million barrels. The acquisition of additional acreage in Canada increased synthetic oil reserves 40 million barrels.

Noteworthy amounts in the categories of natural gas proved-reserve changes for   2011   through   2013   are discussed below:  
  Revisions     In 2011, net revisions increased reserves 497 BCF. For consolidated companies, improved reservoir performance accounted for a majority of the 217 BCF increase in the United States. In Asia, a net increase of 196 BCF was driven by development drilling and improved field performance in Thailand, partially offset by the effects of higher prices on entitlement volumes in Kazakhstan. For affiliated companies, ongoing reservoir assessment resulted in the recognition of additional reserves related to the Angola LNG project. At TCO, improved facility and reservoir performance was more than offset by the price effect on entitlement volumes.  
  In 2012, net revisions increased reserves 1,855 BCF. A net increase of 1,007 BCF in Asia was primarily due to development drilling and additional compression in Bangladesh, and drilling results and improved field performance in Thailand. In Australia, updated reservoir data interpretation based on additional drilling at the Gorgon Project drove the 358 BCF increase. Drilling results from activities in the Marcellus Shale were responsible for the majority of the 318 BCF increase in the United States.    
  In 2013, net revisions increased reserves 718 BCF. A net increase of 627 BCF in Asia was primarily due to development drilling and improved field performance in Bangladesh and Thailand. In Australia, drilling performance drove the 229 BCF increase. The majority of the net decrease of 234 BCF in the United States was due to a change in development plans in the Appalachian region.   

Extensions and Discoveries   In 2011, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 4,680 BCF. In Australia, the Wheatstone Project accounted for the 4,035 BCF in additions. In Africa, the start of a new natural gas development project in Nigeria resulted in the 290 BCF increase. In the United States, development drilling accounted for the majority of the 287 BCF increase.  
  In 2012, extensions and discoveries increased reserves by 1,011 BCF. The increase of 747 BCF in Australia was primarily related to positive drilling results at the Gorgon Project. 
  In 2013, extensions and discoveries increased reserves by 1,021 BCF, with the majority in the Appalachian region in the U.S.  
  Purchases   In 2011, purchases increased reserves 1,233 BCF. In the United States, acquisitions in the Marcellus Shale increased reserves 1,230 BCF.  
  Sales     In 2011, sales decreased reserves 174 BCF. In Australia, the Wheatstone Project unitization and equity sales agreements reduced reserves 77 BCF. In the United States, sales in Alaska and other smaller fields reduced reserves 95 BCF.  
  In 2012, sales decreased reserves by 538 BCF. Sales of a portion of the company's equity interest in the Wheatstone Project were responsible for the 439 BCF reserves reduction in Australia.

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of the FASB. Estimated future cash inflows from production are computed by applying 12-month average prices for oil and gas to year-end quantities of estimated net proved reserves. Future price changes are limited to those provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting year. Future development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and produce year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement obligations. Estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates. These rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated  

using 10 percent midperiod discount factors. Discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced.  
  The information provided does not represent management s estimate of the company s expected future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Moreover, probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation prescribed by the FASB requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and should not be relied upon as an indication of the company s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table,  Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows  refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.

CVX 12.31.2013 EX 10.8 CIP Award Criteria 

Exhibit 10.8 
  SUMMARY OF CHEVRON INCENTIVE PLAN AWARD CRITERIA    
    
  The Chevron Incentive Plan (CIP) is designed to recognize yearly performance achievements. Chevron s named executive officers (NEOs) are eligible to receive awards under the CIP.  Annual operating and financial results figure prominently into this assessment, along with demonstrated progress on key business initiatives.  Individual leadership is also recognized through this award.  The award is delivered as an annual cash bonus based upon a percentage of base salary and is calculated as follows: 
    
                           Base Salary 
    X 
    CIP Award Target 
    X 
    Corporate Performance Rating 
    X 
    Individual Performance Modifier 

CIP Award Target  .   Before the beginning of each performance year, the Management Compensation Committee ( MCC ) of the Board of Directors establishes a CIP Award Target for each NEO, which is based on a percentage of the NEO s base salary.  The MCC sets target awards based on the median award of Chevron s Oil Industry Peer Group (viz. Anadarko Petroleum, BP, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, Hess, Marathon Oil, Marathon Petroleum, Occidental Petroleum, Phillips 66, Royal Dutch Shell, Tesoro and Valero Energy).  All individuals in the same salary grade have the same target, which provides internal equity and consistency.   
    
  Corporate Performance Rating  .   After the end of the performance year, the MCC sets the Corporate Performance Rating.  This rating reflects the MCC s overall assessment of the Company s performance for that year, based on a range of metrics used to measure performance against plan in four broad categories: financial; health, environment and safety; operating; and project development and commercial transactions.  The MCC has discretion on weighting the categories and on weighting the performance metrics within each category. Performance is viewed across multiple parameters (absolute results; results versus plan; results versus peers and/or general industry; performance trends over time) and distinctions are made between the controllable and noncontrollable aspects of the metrics.  With these metrics as the foundation, the MCC exercises its discretion in setting the Corporate Performance Rating. The minimum Corporate Performance Rating is zero and the maximum is 200 percent.  The MCC also reviews actual annual cash award payments for the prior year for Chevron and our Oil Industry Peer Group (identified above), compared with actual business performance for Chevron and for our Oil Industry Peer Group. This comparison assures that the process for determining the Corporate Performance Rating is consistent with our peer group and that actual awards are consistent with both Chevron performance and performance relative to our peers.     
    
  Individual Performance Modifier  .   The MCC also takes into account individual performance. This is largely a personal leadership dimension, recognizing the individual effort and initiative expended and demonstrated progress on key business initiatives during the course of the year. The MCC uses its judgment in analyzing the individual performance of each NEO, his or her enterprise and business segment leadership, and how the business units reporting to the NEO performed.  Chevron s CEO makes recommendations to the MCC as to the Individual Performance Modifier of each of the other NEOs.   
    
  Chevron reports annual CIP awards to each of its NEOs in its Annual Report on Form 10-K or its annual Proxy Statement.

  Long-Term Incentive Plan Award 
  Terms and Conditions    
    
  1.    STOCK OPTION AWARD  .  Your  YEAR  Stock Option Award is for non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Chevron Corporation common stock. These stock options are granted to you under the Long-Term Incentive Plan ( Plan ).  The Plan s terms and the terms of the Rules adopted pursuant to the Plan are incorporated herein.  For a copy of the plan documents, go to   http://hr.chevron.com/northamerica/us/payprograms/executiveplans/ltip.asp   or the Global Executive Plans Web site at   http://hr.chevron.com/globalprograms/execplans/ltip.aspx  , or contact the Executive Compensation Group at   execplans@chevron.com   or 1-925-842-7304. By accepting this Stock Option Award, you agree to all terms and conditions of the Plan, its Rules, and any provisions herein that may be in addition thereto (which shall not be in conflict with the provisions of the Plan or its Rules).  The aforesaid documents, the number of options granted and the grant price reflected on the   DATE  grant detail screen in the Stock Option/SAR section of your Morgan Stanley account collectively constitute the Award. 
           A.   
    GRANT DATE.   The Grant Date of your Stock Option Award is   DATE . 
              B.   
    NUMBER OF OPTIONS GRANTED.    The number of stock options granted is reflected on the   DATE  grant detail screen in the  Stock Option/SAR  section of your Morgan Stanley account at   www.benefitaccess.com  . 
              C.   
    EXERCISE PRICE.   The Exercise Price of the stock options granted in your   DATE  Stock Option Award is the Chevron common stock closing price on   DATE , as listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ). The Exercise Price is reflected on the   DATE  grant detail screen as referenced above.  
              D.   
    VESTING SCHEDULE.   Subject to Subsection F., 33 1/3 percent of the Stock Option Award shall vest on the first anniversary of the Grant Date, 66 2/3 percent shall vest on the second anniversary of the Grant Date and 100 percent shall vest on the third anniversary of the Grant Date. The Stock Option Award cannot be exercised to the extent it is not vested. 
              E.   
    EXERCISE PERIOD.   Subject to Subsection F., your vested stock options in the   DATE  Stock Option Award may be exercised up until the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, provided you remain employed by Chevron and the NYSE is open on such date.  Should this tenth anniversary date fall on a day that the NYSE is not open, your vested   DATE  stock options may be exercised only up until the last day that the NYSE is open immediately prior to that tenth anniversary.     
              F.   
    EFFECT OF TERMINATION ON VESTING AND EXERCISE PERIOD.   Termination of employment impacts your Stock Option Award s Vesting Schedule and Exercise Period. If you are on a non-European Union country s payroll at termination of employment, your Stock Option Award is affected as follows.  
              i.   
    One hundred percent (100%) of the   DATE  Stock Option Award will vest if your employment terminates on or after   DATE    and   if, upon termination of employment, you are at least age 65, have at least 90 points (sum of age and health and welfare service at termination of employment), or submit documentation substantiating required retirement due to the attainment of the normal statutory or mandatory retirement age, based on the applicable jurisdiction for your employing company at the time of termination. Your vested Stock Option Award is exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date as described in Subsection E.   
              ii.   
    A portion of the   DATE  Stock Option Award will vest if your employment terminates on or after   DATE    and   if, upon termination of employment, you are at least age 60 or have at least 75 points (sum of age and health and welfare service at termination of employment). The number of vested stock options is determined by multiplying the number of stock options granted by the number of whole months from the Grant Date to your termination date, up to a maximum of 36 months, divided by 36 months.  The portion not vested is forfeited.  The vested portion of your   DATE  Stock Option Award is exercisable until the last day that the NYSE is open that is no more than five years after your termination date or, if earlier, the date it would last be exercisable under Subsection E. in the absence of your termination.  
              iii.   
    One hundred percent (100%) of the   DATE  Stock Option Award will vest if you terminate employment after a Change in Control and qualify for a Change of Control severance pay program.  Your vested Stock Option Award is exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date as described in Subsection E.   
              iv.   
    If at termination of employment, none of the above Subsections F.i., F.ii., and F.iii. is satisfied, the portion of your    DATE  Stock Option Award that is not vested at termination is forfeited. The portion of your   DATE  Stock Option Award that is already vested is exercisable until the last day that the NYSE is open that is no more than 180 days after your termination date or, if earlier, the date it would last be exercisable under Subsection E. in the absence of your termination.  
      If you are on a European Union country s payroll at termination of employment, different rules apply. 

G.   
    DISABILITY.    For purposes of the Vesting Schedule and the Exercise Period of your Stock Option Award, you are deemed to have terminated upon the earlier of twenty-nine (29) months after the commencement of long-term disability benefits under a plan or program sponsored by the Corporation, or the date you fail to qualify or no longer qualify for such long-term disability benefits, provided that you do not return to active employment with the Corporation at that time. 
              H.   
    FAILURE TO EXERCISE.   Unexercised Stock Option Awards are forfeited at the end of the applicable Exercise Period.   
              I.   
          EXERCISE CHOICES.   You may exercise your vested   DATE  Stock Option Award under the following four exercise choices: (i) same day sale; (ii) sell-to-cover; (iii) cash exercise; or (iv) stock swap.

              L.   
    TAXATION.    The tax consequences of Stock Option Awards vary, and, depending on the country s laws that govern this Stock Option Award, can be triggered upon events such as the grant, vest, and/or exercise.   
              i.   
    U.S. TAXATION.   If you are subject to U.S. taxes, your   DATE  Stock Option Award is taxable upon exercise.

Additional taxes may be either withheld or refunded on your paycheck.  The taxable compensation as a result of your exercise will be included in your W-2 Form. If your exercise includes the sale of shares, you will also receive a Form 1099B from the broker that reflects the sale.

              N.   
    NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARD.   You are not permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, assign or encumber this   DATE  Stock Option Award during your lifetime.

           1.   
    PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD  .  Your  YEAR  Performance Share Award is granted to you under the Long-Term Incentive Plan ( Plan ).

              E.   
    EFFECT OF TERMINATION ON VESTING.   Termination of employment impacts the vesting of your Performance Share Award, but not when its value is calculated or when it is paid. If you are on a non-European Union country s payroll at termination of employment and terminate prior to the end of the three-year performance period, vesting of your   DATE  Performance Share Award is affected as follows: 
              i.   
    One hundred percent (100%) of the   DATE  Performance Share Award will vest if your employment terminates on or after   DATE    and   if, upon termination of employment, you are at least age 65, have at least 90 points (sum of age and health and welfare service at termination of employment), or submit documentation substantiating required retirement due to the attainment of the normal statutory or mandatory retirement age, based on the applicable jurisdiction for your employing company at the time of termination.  
              ii.   
    A portion of the   DATE  Performance Share Award will vest if your employment terminates on or after    DATE    and   if, upon termination of employment, you are at least age 60 or have at least 75 points (sum of age and health and welfare service at termination of employment). The portion of your   DATE  Performance Share Award that vests is determined by multiplying the number of Performance Shares granted by the number of whole months from the performance period start date to your termination date, up to a maximum of 36 months, divided by 36 months.  The portion not vested is forfeited.  
              iii.   
    If you terminate employment after a Change in Control, qualify for a Change of Control severance pay program, and do not satisfy the conditions in Subsection E.i., the portion of your   DATE  Performance Share Award vested and or deemed vested shall be determined by multiplying the number of Performance Shares granted by the number of whole months from the performance period start date to your termination date, up to a maximum of 36 months, divided by 36 months.  The portion not vested is forfeited. 
              iv.   
    If at termination of employment, none of the above Subsections E.i, E.ii., and E.iii. is satisfied, your   DATE  Performance Share Award is forfeited. 
     If you are on a European Union country s payroll at termination of employment, different rules apply. 
           F.   
    DISABILITY.    For     purposes of the vesting of your   DATE  Performance Share Award, you are deemed to have terminated upon the earlier of twenty-nine (29) months after the commencement of long-term disability benefits under a plan or program sponsored by the Corporation, or the date you fail to qualify or no longer qualify for such long-term disability benefits, provided that you do not return to active employment with the Corporation at that time. 
              G.   
    PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD PAYOUT.    The payout amount of your    DATE  Performance Share Award is equal to the number of your vested   DATE  Performance Shares, multiplied by the Average Chevron Stock Closing Price in the last twenty days that the New York Stock Exchange is open during the Performance Period, multiplied by the Payout Modifier, as described below.  
              H.   
    PAYOUT MODIFIER.   The Payout Modifier is determined as follows based on Chevron s total stockholder return (TSR) compared with the TSR for the Peer Group for the three-year Performance Period: 

The Peer Group for your   DATE  Performance Share Award is BP, ExxonMobil, RD Shell and Total. In the event Chevron s measured TSR is within 1 percent of the nearest competitor(s), the results will be considered a tie, and the Payout Modifier will be determined by dividing the sum of the Payout Modifiers in the tied positions by the number of companies in the tie. 
  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary  ,   the Committee retains the discretion to adjust the payout of Performance Shares downward if business or economic conditions warrant, as the Committee determines. 
           I.   
          PAYMENT DATE.   The non-deferred   DATE  Performance Share Award will be paid in cash within two and a half months after   DATE . 
              J.   
         DEFERRAL  . You may defer payment of up to 90 percent of your payout attributable to your  DATE  Performance Share Award, provided you are on the U.S. Payroll and subject to U.S. taxes on the deferral election due date. Deferral elections may not be cancelled or changed after the deferral election due date or upon termination of employment. Deferred amounts will be further subject to all terms and conditions of the Deferred Compensation Plan II and its Rules. 

K.   
    MISCONDUCT.   Performance Share Awards may be forfeited for Misconduct as defined in the Long-Term Incentive Plan, and the Corporation may demand repayment of amounts received on or after the date of the Misconduct.  
              L.   
    TAXATION.     
              i.   
    U.S. TAXATION.   If you are subject to U.S. taxes, your non-deferred   DATE  Performance Share Award payout is taxable as ordinary income in  YEAR , the calendar year in which it is paid. Payments are subject to federal, state, Social Security, Medicare, and/or local income taxes. Deferred amounts are subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes. Consult   http://hr.chevron.com/northamerica/us/payprograms/executiveplans/taxwithholding.asp   and your tax advisor for more information on U.S. taxes. 
              ii.   
    NON-U.S. TAXATION.   Your vested   DATE  Performance Share Award will be paid in your local currency, and subject to tax withholding according to your country s requirements. Consult specific country prospectus supplements and your tax advisor for more information regarding non-U.S. taxation. 
              M.   
    ADJUSTMENTS.    In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, or other similar corporate change, the number of performance shares subject to this agreement shall be adjusted, as appropriate.  
              N.   
    NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARD.   You are not permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, assign or encumber this   DATE  Performance Share Award during your lifetime. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this   DATE   Performance Share Award may be transferred or assigned after your death to your beneficiary or pursuant to a domestic relations order enforceable under applicable law.

Exhibit 95  
  Mine Safety Disclosure  
  Chevron is an operator of the following coal and molybdenum mines for which reporting requirements apply under Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as a result of citations and orders received from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) during the   year   ending   December 31, 2013  . In evaluating this information, consideration should be given to factors such as: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of the mine, (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and in that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed.  
  The items in the table below refer to the applicable sections of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration Act of 1977 under which reporting is required for the   year   ending   December 31, 2013  .

 EXHIBIT 99.1

CVX 12.31.2013 EX 99.1 Definitions 

Exhibit 99.1 
    
  DEFINITIONS OF SELECTED ENERGY TERMS 
    
  Barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE) 
  A unit of measure to quantify crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas amounts using the same basis. Natural gas volumes are converted to barrels on the basis of energy content. See   oil-equivalent gas   and   production  . 
    
  Development 
  Drilling, construction and related activities following discovery that are necessary to begin production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas. 
    
  Exploration 
  Searching for crude oil and/or natural gas by utilizing geologic and topographical studies, geophysical and seismic surveys, and drilling of wells. 
    
  Gas-to-liquids     (GTL) 
  A process that converts natural gas into high-quality liquid transportation fuels and other products. 
    
  Liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
  Natural gas that is liquefied under extremely cold temperatures to facilitate storage or transportation in specially designed vessels. 
    
  Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) 
  Light gases, such as butane and propane, that can be maintained as liquids while under pressure. 
    
  Oil-equivalent gas (OEG) 
  The volume of natural gas needed to generate the equivalent amount of heat as a barrel of crude oil. Approximately 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of crude oil. 
    
  Oil sands 
  Naturally occurring mixture of bitumen   a heavy, viscous form of crude oil   water, sand and clay. Using hydroprocessing technology, bitumen can be refined to yield   synthetic oil. 
    
  Price Effects on Entitlement Volumes 
  The impact on Chevron s share of net production and net proved reserves due to changes in crude oil and natural gas prices between periods.  Under production-sharing and variable-royalty provisions of certain agreements, price variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to the company.  For example, at higher prices, fewer volumes are required for Chevron to recover its costs under certain production-sharing contracts. 
    
  Production 
  Total production   refers to all the crude oil (including synthetic oil), natural gas liquids and natural gas produced from a property.   Net production   is gross production minus both royalties paid to landowners and a government s agreed-upon share of production under a   production-sharing contract  .   Liquids   production refers to crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil volumes.   Oil-equivalent production   is the sum of the barrels of   liquids   and the oil-equivalent barrels of natural gas produced. See   barrels of oil-equivalent   and   oil-equivalent gas. 
    
  Production-sharing contract (PSC) 
  An agreement between a government and a contractor (generally an oil and gas company) whereby production is shared between the parties in a prearranged manner. The contractor typically incurs all exploration, development and production costs, which are subsequently recoverable out of an agreed-upon share of any future PSC production, referred to as cost recovery oil and/or gas. Any remaining production, referred to as profit oil and/or gas, is shared     between the parties on an agreed-upon basis as stipulated in the PSC. The government may also retain a share of PSC production as a royalty payment, and the contractor typically owes income tax on its portion of the profit oil or gas. The contractor s share of PSC oil and/or gas production and reserves varies over time, as     it is dependent on prices, costs and specific PSC terms. 
    
  Reserves 
  Crude oil or natural gas contained in underground rock formations called reservoirs and saleable hydrocarbons extracted from oil sands, shale, coalbeds or other nonrenewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas.   Net proved reserves   are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be  
    E-10 

economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, and exclude royalties and interests owned by others. Estimates change as additional information becomes available.   Oil-equivalent reserves   are the sum of the liquids reserves and the oil-equivalent gas reserves. See   barrels of oil-equivalent   and   oil-equivalent gas.   The company discloses only net proved reserves in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
    
  Shale gas 
  Natural gas produced from shale rock formations where the gas was sourced from within the shale itself. Shale is very fine-grained rock, characterized by low porosity and extremely low permeability. Production of shale gas normally requires formation stimulation such as the use of hydraulic fracturing (pumping a fluid-sand mixture into the formation under high pressure) to help produce the gas. 
    
  Tight oil 
  Liquid hydrocarbons produced from shale (also referred to as shale oil) and other rock formations with extremely low permeability.  As with   shale gas  , production from tight oil reservoirs normally requires formation stimulation such as hydraulic fracturing. 
    
  Synthetic oil 
  A marketable and transportable hydrocarbon liquid, resembling crude oil, that is produced by upgrading highly viscous or solid hydrocarbons, such as extra-heavy crude oil or   oil sands  . 

DEFINITIONS OF SELECTED FINANCIAL TERMS 
    
  Earnings 
  The term   earnings   is net income attributable to Chevron Corporation as presented on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
    
  Return on capital employed (ROCE) 
  ROCE is calculated by dividing   earnings   (adjusted for after-tax interest expense and noncontrolling interests) by the average of total debt, noncontrolling interests and Chevron Corporation stockholders  equity for the year. 
    
  Return on stockholders  equity 
  Return on stockholders  equity is   earnings   divided by average Chevron Corporation stockholders  equity. Average Chevron Corporation stockholders  equity is computed by averaging the sum of the beginning-of-year and end-of-year balances.
