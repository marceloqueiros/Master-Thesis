CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  FOR THE PURPOSE OF  SAFE HARBOR  PROVISIONS OF THE  PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995    
    
  This   Annual Report on Form 10-K   of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking statements relating to Chevron s operations that are based on management s current expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries. Words such as  anticipates,   expects,   intends,   plans,   targets,   forecasts,   projects,   believes,   seeks,   schedules,   estimates,   may,   could,   budgets,   outlook  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the company s control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  
  Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological developments; the results of operations and financial condition of equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company s production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, other natural or human factors, or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes, regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other pending or future litigation; the company s future acquisition or disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors set forth under the heading  Risk Factors  on pages 22 through 24 in this report. In addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

PART I    
    Item 1. Business 
    General Development of Business 
    Summary Description of Chevron  
  Chevron Corporation,   *    a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, and power and energy services. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.  
  A list of the company s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-4. As of December 31,   2014  , Chevron had approximately 64,700 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees). Approximately 31,800 employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 49 percent, were employed in U.S. operations.  
  Overview of Petroleum Industry  
  Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. 
  Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets.  
  Operating Environment  
  Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-9 of this Form 10-K in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company s current business environment and outlook. 
  Chevron s Strategic Direction  
  Chevron s primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the company s strategies are to grow profitably in core areas and build new legacy positions. In the downstream, the strategies are to deliver competitive returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to apply commercial excellence in supply, trading and transportation to enable the success of the upstream and downstream strategies, and to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance.  
  Information about the company is available on the company s website at   www.chevron.com  . Information contained on the company s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The company s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the company s website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SEC s website at   www.sec.gov  . 
    ________________________________________________________ 
   *    Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term  Chevron  and such terms as  the company,   the corporation,   our,   we  and  us  may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include  affiliates  of Chevron   i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.

Description of Business and Properties 
  The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects   *    in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31,   2014  , and assets as of the end of   2014   and   2013     for the United States and the company s international geographic areas   are in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-37. Similar comparative data for the company s investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 13 and 14 on pages FS-40 through FS-41. Refer to page FS-13 of this Form 10-K in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company's capital and exploratory expenditures.  
    
    Upstream  
    Reserves  
  Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-65 for a tabulation of the company s proved net liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of   2012   and each year-end from   2012   through   2014  . Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31,   2014  , are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations. 
  At December 31, 2014, 20 percent of the company's net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan and 19 percent were located in the United States. 
  The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years   2012   through   2014   are shown in the following table:  

*    Oil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of oil. 
    ________________________________________________________ 
            *   
    As used in this report, the term  project  may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of the term  project  as it relates to any specific governmental law or regulation. 
     4 

Net Production of Liquids and Natural Gas  
  The following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for   2014   and   2013   by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of   2.571 million   barrels per day in   2014   was down 1 percent from   2013  . Production increases in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania, and project ramp-ups in Nigeria, Argentina and Brazil, were more than offset by normal field declines, production entitlement effects in several locations and the effect of asset sales. Refer to the  Results of Operations  section beginning on page FS-7 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the   2012   through   2014   changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas, and refer to Table V on pages FS-68 and FS-69 for information on annual production by geographical region. 

5 

Production Outlook 
  The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in   2015   will be flat to 3 percent growth compared to 2014. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, as described beginning on page FS-4. Refer to the  Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,  beginning on page 8, for a discussion of the company s major crude oil and natural gas development projects. 
    
    Average Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of Production  
  Refer to Table IV on page FS-64 for the company s average sales price per barrel of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and per thousand cubic feet of natural gas produced, and the average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  .  
    Gross and Net Productive Wells  
  The following table summarizes gross and net productive wells at year-end   2014   for the company and its affiliates:  

Acreage  
  At December 31,   2014  , the company owned or had under lease or similar agreements undeveloped and developed crude oil and natural gas properties throughout the world. The geographical distribution of the company s acreage is shown in the following table: 

Delivery Commitments    
  The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below.  
  In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 239 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties through   2017  . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments include a variety of pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts.  
    6 

Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 705 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from   2015   through   2017   from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company s proved developed reserves in these countries. 
    Development Activities  
  Refer to Table I on page FS-61 for details associated with the company s development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  . 
  The following table summarizes the company s net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the company s development wells drilling at December 31,   2014  . A  development well  is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.  

Exploration Activities  
  Refer to Table I on page FS-61 for detail on the company s exploration expenditures and costs of unproved property acquisitions for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  .  
  The following table summarizes the company s net interests in productive and dry exploratory wells completed in each of the last three years, and the number of exploratory wells drilling at December 31,   2014  .  Exploratory wells  are wells drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in unproved areas and include delineation and appraisal wells, which are wells drilled to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir beyond the proved area.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas  
  Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world's major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron s   2014   key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page FS-3, are presented below. The comments include references to  total production  and  net production,  which are defined under  Production  in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-10.  
  The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the company s share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned.  
    United States 
  Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in California, the Gulf of Mexico, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming. Average net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2014 was 664,000 barrels per day.  
  In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2014, net daily production averaged 163,000 barrels of crude oil, 66 million cubic feet of natural gas and 3,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). Approximately 86 percent of the crude oil production is considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22 degrees).  
  During 2014, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 133,000 barrels of crude oil, 320 million cubic feet of natural gas and 15,000 barrels of NGLs. Chevron was engaged in various exploration and development activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico during 2014.  
  The Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company-operated. Chevron's interest in the production host facility is 40.6 percent. The facility has a design capacity of 170,000 barrels of crude oil and 42 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development as well as third-party tiebacks. First production was achieved in December 2014, and production from three of 10 planned wells ramped-up during first quarter 2015. In addition, front-end engineering and design (FEED) activities continued in 2014 on the second phase of the development plan for the Jack and St. Malo fields, and construction is expected to commence on Stage 2 in 2016. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. Production from the Jack/St. Malo development is expected to ramp up to a total daily rate of 94,000 barrels of crude oil and 21 million cubic feet of natural gas. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated production life of 30 years from the time of start-up.

  Shipping:   The company's marine fleet includes both U.S. and foreign-flagged vessels. The U.S.-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting refined products, primarily in the coastal waters of the United States. The foreign-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Black Sea, South America, Mexico and West Africa to ports in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia, as well as refined products and feedstocks to and from various locations worldwide. In 2014, the company took delivery of three bareboat charter VLCCs and two Pacific Area Lightering vessels. 
  The company also owns a 16.7 percent interest in each of seven LNG carriers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf Venture in Australia. In 2014, the company took delivery of two new LNG carriers in support of its developing LNG portfolio. 
    Other Businesses    
    Power and Energy Management:   The company's power and energy management operation delivers comprehensive commercial, engineering and operational support services to improve power reliability and energy efficiency for Chevron's operations worldwide. The business operates a variety of power assets, including gas-fired cogeneration facilities within Chevron's San Joaquin Valley operations in California, and renewable power facilities in California, New Mexico and Wyoming. The business also manages Chevron's investments in six renewable power projects in California, Arizona and Texas. 
  Chevron also has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the Philippines. For additional information on the company's geothermal operations refer to page 15 in the Upstream section. 
    Research and Technology:     Chevron's energy technology organization supports upstream and downstream businesses.

Additionally, in 2014, the company made investments in start-up companies with technologies for pipeline integrity, efficient carbon dioxide capture from flue gas and big data management.  
    21 

Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Refer to Note 25 beginning on FS-59 for a summary of the company's research and development expenses.  
    Environmental Protection:     The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to  minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation.  
  To complement the company s capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP). SWRP s objective is to further develop the industry s capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world.  
  Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page FS-16 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's   2014   environmental expenditures. Refer to page FS-16 and Note 23 on page FS-58 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 22 through 24 for a discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change.  
    Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  Chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures. Nevertheless, some inherent risks could materially impact the company s results of operations or financial condition.  
  Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices:     Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company s results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas or other actions imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. As such, an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. 
  During extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil, the company s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected, as will its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. The impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales.  
  The scope of Chevron s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources:     The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the company s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.  
  The company s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors:   Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control, including hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. 
  Chevron utilizes comprehensive risk management systems to assess potential physical and other risks to its assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions involve uncertainty analysis, which incorporates potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, Chevron cannot predict the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. 
    22 

The company s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight:   Chevron s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks.  
  Chevron s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action:   The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.  
  For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, including information relating to Ecuador matters, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-42. 
  The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure:   The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition.  
  Political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm Chevron s business:        The company s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company s operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company s operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. In addition, changes in national or state environmental regulations, including those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability. 
  Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevron s operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron s products:     Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the company s operations and financial results.  
  International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, the company s activities in it and market conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the company s exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers  or customers  use of the company s products. Some of these activities, such as consumers  and customers  use of the company s products, as well as actions taken by the company s competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the company s control.  
    23 

The effect of regulation on the company s financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the company s ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company s products. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the company s sales volumes, revenues and margins.  
  Changes in management s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period:     In preparing the company s periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the company s business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

    Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
  Ecuador:     Information related to Ecuador matters is included in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading Ecuador, beginning on page FS-42.  
  Certain Governmental Proceedings:     As previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed on February 21, 2014, on August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron U.S.A. Inc. refinery in Richmond, California. Various federal, state, and local agencies initiated investigations as a result of the incident. Based on its civil investigation, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Finding of Violations (FOV) to Chevron on December 17, 2013, which includes 62 findings of alleged noncompliance at the refinery. The majority of these findings relate to the August 2012 fire and alleged violations of chemical-accident-prevention laws, but the FOV also addresses a number of release-reporting issues, some of which are unrelated to the fire. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. 
  As previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed on February 21, 2014, in July 2009, the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) alleged that Chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties in conjunction with commitments Chevron undertook to install and operate certain air emission control equipment at its Hawaii Refinery pursuant to a Clean Air Act settlement with the United States EPA and the DOH. The company has disputed many of the allegations. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.  
  As initially disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed on February 21, 2014, the State of New Mexico provided to Chevron a Notice of Violation on December 11, 2013, alleging that the flaring of fuel gas that occurred during periodic compressor purging events at the Chevron Buckeye CO2 plant resulted in hourly air emissions during these events in excess of the plant permit limits and alleging that the company had failed to timely report these excess emissions. The company has reached a settlement agreement with the State of New Mexico and paid a civil penalty of less than $100,000 to resolve the alleged violation  . 
    24 

As initially disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2014, filed May 2, 2014, a fire was reported on February 11, 2014, at Chevron Appalachia, LLC s Lanco 7H well located in Dunkard Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States (OSHA) initiated investigations as a result of the incident. Based on its civil investigation to date, the PA DEP has issued Chevron a Notice of Violation alleging nine separate incidents of noncompliance. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. 
    Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
  Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 C.F.R.   229.104) is included in Exhibit 95 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

   Key Financial Results    

Refer to the  Results of Operations  section beginning on page FS-7 for a discussion of financial results by major operating area for the three years ended   December 31, 2014  .  
      
  Business Environment and Outlook  
  Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of the Congo, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela, and Vietnam. 
  Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil. The price of crude oil has fallen significantly since mid-year 2014, reflecting robust non-OPEC supply growth led by expanding unconventional production in the United States, weakening growth in emerging markets, and the decision by OPEC in fourth quarter 2014 to maintain its current production ceiling. The downturn in the price of crude oil  has impacted, and, depending upon its duration, will continue to significantly impact the company's results of operations, cash flows, capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook. If lower prices persist for an extended period of time, the company's response could include further reductions in operating expenses and capital and exploratory expenditures and additional asset sales. The company anticipates that crude oil prices will increase in the future, as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance; however, the timing of any such increases is unknown.  In the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products.   
  Refer to the "Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information" on page 2 and to "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A, on pages  22 through 24 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition.  
  The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company s financial performance and growth. Refer to the  Results of Operations  section beginning on page FS-7 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during   2014  . Asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

   The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of changes in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of ongoing operations and for business planning. 
  Comments related to earnings trends for the company s major business areas are as follows: 
  Upstream     Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas or other actions imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations. 
  The company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. However, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company s control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, commodity prices and prices charged by the industry s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. In recent years, Chevron and the oil and gas industry generally experienced an increase in certain costs that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. As a result of the decline in prices of crude oil and other commodities in 2014, these cost pressures are beginning to soften. Capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest. 

The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $99 per barrel for the full-year   2014  , compared to $109 in   2013  . As of mid-February   2015  , the Brent price was $60 per barrel. The majority of the company s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. While geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions supported crude prices through mid-year, crude prices have since been in decline, as signs of crude oil over-supply emerged during the second half of the year due to continued robust non-OPEC supply growth, concern over softness in the global economic recovery, and material easing of geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions. Downward pressure on crude pricing has been further magnified by OPEC s decision in November 2014  to maintain the current production ceiling of 30 million barrels per day despite evidence of market surplus. 
  The WTI price averaged $93 per barrel for the full-year   2014  , compared to $98 in   2013  . As of mid-February   2015  , the WTI price was $53 per barrel. WTI traded at a discount to Brent throughout 2014 due to high inventories and excess crude supply in the U.S. market.  
    FS-  -3 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

   A differential in crude oil prices exists between high-quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). The amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude versus the demand, which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). After peaking early in second quarter 2014, the differential has eased in North America as refinery crude runs remained at or above record levels. Outside of North America, easing of geopolitical tensions and continued expansion of supply of light sweet crudes has pressured light sweet crude prices relative to those for heavier, more sour crudes.  
  Chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in California, Indonesia, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in Angola, China and the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. (See page FS-11 for the company s average U.S. and international crude oil realizations.) 
  In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. Fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the United States are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and stored in North America. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $4.28 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during   2014  , compared with $3.70 during   2013  . As of mid-February   2015  , the Henry Hub spot price was $2.73 per MCF.  
  Outside the United States, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand, regulatory and commercial   factors. In some locations, Chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. The company's contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Chevron's international natural gas realizations averaged $5.78 per MCF during   2014  , compared with $5.91 per MCF during   2013  . (See page FS-11 for the company s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.) 

The company s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in   2014   averaged   2.571 million   million barrels per day. About one-fifth of the company s net oil-equivalent production in   2014   occurred in the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Nigeria, Venezuela and the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. OPEC quotas had no effect on the company s net crude oil production in   2014   or   2013  . At their November 2014 meeting, members of OPEC supported maintaining the current production quota of 30 million barrels per day, which has been in effect since December 2008.  
  The company estimates that oil-equivalent production in   2015   will be flat to 3 percent growth compared to 2014. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including the duration of the low price environment that began in second-half  2014; quotas that may be imposed by OPEC; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature

   fields; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. A significant majority of Chevron s upstream investment is made outside the United States. 
  Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent at year-end 2014, a decrease of 1 percent from year-end 2013. The reserve replacement ratio in 2014 was 89 percent. Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-65 for a tabulation of the company s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of   2012   and each year-end from   2012   through   2014  , and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending   December 31, 2014  . 
  On November 7, 2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater Frade Field about 75 miles offshore Brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. The source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned.  On March 14, 2012, the company identified a small, second seep in a different part of the field.  No evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts related to either of these seeps have emerged.  As reported in the company s previously filed periodic reports, it has resolved civil claims relating to these incidents brought by a Brazilian federal district prosecutor.  As also reported previously, the federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against Chevron and eleven Chevron employees. On February 19, 2013, the trial court dismissed the criminal matter, and on appeal, on October 9, 2013, the appellate court reinstated two of the ten allegations, specifically those charges alleging environmental damage and failure to provide timely notification to authorities.  On February 27, 2014, Chevron filed a motion for reconsideration.  While reconsideration of the motion to dismiss is pending, there will be further proceedings on the reinstated allegations.  The company s ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable. 
  Refer to the  Results of Operations  section on pages FS-7 through FS-9 for additional discussion of the company s upstream business. 
  Downstream   Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events. 
  Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets. 
  The company s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Asia and southern Africa. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. 
  Refer to the  Results of Operations  section on pages FS-7 through FS-9 for additional discussion of the company s downstream operations. 
  All Other     consists of mining activities, power and energy services, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.

   Results of Operations    
  The following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the company s business segments   Upstream and Downstream   as well as for  All Other.  Earnings are also presented for the U.S. and international geographic areas of the Upstream and Downstream business segments. Refer to Note 12, beginning on page FS-37, for a discussion of the company s  reportable segments.  This section should also be read in conjunction with the discussion in  Business Environment and Outlook  on pages FS-2 through FS-5. 

U.S. Upstream    

U.S. upstream earnings of   $3.3 billion   in   2014   decreased   $717 million   from   2013  , primarily due to lower crude oil prices of $950 million. Higher depreciation expenses of $440 million and higher operating expenses of $210 million also contributed to the decline. Partially offsetting the decrease were higher gains on asset sales of $700 million in the current period compared with $60 million in 2013, higher natural gas realizations of $150 million and higher crude oil production of $100 million. 
  U.S. upstream earnings of   $4.0 billion   in   2013   decreased   $1.3 billion   from   2012  , primarily due to higher operating, depreciation and exploration expenses of $420 million, $350 million, and $190 million, respectively, and lower crude oil production of $170 million. Higher natural gas realizations of approximately $200 million were mostly offset by lower crude oil realizations of $170 million.  
  The company s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in   2014   was   $84.13   per barrel, compared with   $93.46   in   2013   and   $95.21   in   2012  . The average natural gas realization was   $3.90   per thousand cubic feet in   2014  , compared with   $3.37   and   $2.64   in   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
  Net oil-equivalent production in   2014   averaged   664,000   barrels per day, up 1 percent from both   2013   and   2012  . Between   2014   and   2013  , production increases in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania were partially offset by normal field declines. Between   2013   and   2012  , new production in the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania and the Delaware Basin in New Mexico, along with the absence of weather-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, was largely offset by normal field declines.  
  The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for   2014   averaged   456,000   barrels per day, up   2 percent   from   2013   and largely unchanged from   2012  . Net natural gas production averaged about   1.3 billion   cubic feet per day in   2014  , largely unchanged from   2013   and up   4 percent   from   2012  . Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table on page FS-11 for a three-year comparative of production volumes in the United States.

   International Upstream 

International upstream earnings were   $13.6 billion   in   2014   compared with   $16.8 billion   in   2013  . The decrease between periods was primarily due to lower crude oil prices and sales volumes of $2.0 billion and $400 million, respectively. Also contributing to the decrease were higher depreciation expenses of $1.0 billion, mainly related to impairments and other asset writeoffs, and higher operating and tax expenses of $340 million and $310 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these items were gains on asset sales of  $1.1 billion in 2014, compared with $140 million in 2013. Foreign currency effects increased earnings by   $597 million   in   2014  , compared with an increase of   $559 million   a year earlier.  
  International upstream earnings were   $16.8 billion   in   2013   compared with   $18.5 billion   in   2012  . The decrease was mainly due to the absence of 2012 gains of approximately $1.4 billion on an asset exchange in Australia and $600 million on the sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project, lower crude oil prices of $500 million, and higher operating expense of $400 million. Partially offsetting these effects were lower income tax expenses of $430 million. Foreign currency effects increased earnings by   $559 million   in   2013  , compared with a decrease of   $275 million   a year earlier.  
  The company s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in   2014   was   $90.42   per barrel, compared with   $100.26   in   2013   and   $101.88   in   2012  . The average natural gas realization was   $5.78   per thousand cubic feet in   2014  , compared with   $5.91   and   $5.99   in   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
  International net oil-equivalent production was   1.91 million   barrels per day in   2014  , a decrease of   2 percent   from   2013   and   2012  . Production increases due to project ramp-ups in Nigeria, Argentina and Brazil in 2014 were more than offset by normal field declines, production entitlement effects in several locations and the effect of asset sales. The decline between   2013   and   2012   was a result of project ramp-ups in Nigeria and Angola in 2013 being more than offset by normal field declines. 
  The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was   1.25 million   barrels per day in   2014  , a decrease of approximately   2 percent   from   2013   and a decrease of approximately   4 percent   from   2012  . International net natural gas production of   3.9 billion   cubic feet per day in   2014   was down   1 percent   from   2013   and up   1 percent   from   2012  . 
  Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table, on page FS-11, for a three-year comparative of international production volumes.  
    
  U.S. Downstream  

U.S. downstream operations earned   $2.6 billion   in   2014  , compared with   $787 million   in   2013  . Higher margins on refined product sales increased earnings $830 million. Gains from asset sales were $960 million in 2014, compared with $250 million a year earlier. Higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $160 million and lower operating expenses of $80 million also contributed to the earnings increase. 
  U.S. downstream operations earned   $787 million   in   2013  , compared with   $2.0 billion   in   2012  . The decrease was mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales of $860 million and higher operating expenses of $600 million, reflecting repair and maintenance activities at the company's refineries. The decrease was partially offset by higher earnings of $150 million from 50 percent-owned CPChem. 
  Refined product sales of 1.21 million barrels per day in   2014   increased 2 percent, mainly reflecting higher gas oil sales. Sales volumes of refined products were   1.18 million   barrels per day in   2013  , a decrease of 2 percent from   2012  , mainly reflecting lower gas oil and gasoline sales. U.S. branded gasoline sales of 516,000 barrels per day in   2014   were essentially unchanged from 2013 and   2012  .  
  Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table on page FS-11 for a three-year comparison of sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery input volumes.

   International Downstream  

International downstream earned   $1.7 billion   in   2014  , compared with   $1.5 billion   in   2013  . The increase was mainly due to a favorable change in the effects on derivative instruments of $640 million. The increase was partially offset by the economic buyout of a legacy pension obligation of $160 million in the current period, lower margins on refined product sales of $130 million and higher tax expenses of $110 million. Foreign currency effects decreased earnings by   $112 million   in   2014  , compared to a decrease of   $76 million   a year earlier.  
  International downstream earned   $1.5 billion   in   2013  , compared with   $2.3 billion   in   2012  . Earnings decreased due to lower gains on asset sales of $540 million and higher income tax expenses of $110 million. Foreign currency effects decreased earnings by   $76 million   in   2013  , compared with a decrease of   $173 million   a year earlier. 
  Total refined product sales of 1.50 million barrels per day in 2014 declined 2 percent from 2013, mainly reflecting lower gas oil sales. Sales of 1.53 million barrels per day in 2013 declined 2 percent from 2012, mainly reflecting lower fuel oil and gasoline sales.  
  Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table, on page FS-11, for a three-year comparison of sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery input volumes. 
    
  All Other  

All Other consists of mining activities, power and energy services, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.  
  Net charges in   2014   increased   $365 million   from   2013  , mainly due to environmental reserves additions, asset impairments and additional asset retirement obligations for mining assets, as well as higher corporate tax items. These increases were partially offset by the absence of 2013 impairments of power-related affiliates and lower other corporate charges. Net charges in   2013   decreased   $285 million   from   2012  , mainly due to lower corporate tax items and other corporate charges. 
      
  Consolidated Statement of Income    
  Comparative amounts for certain income statement categories are shown below: 

Sales and other operating revenues decreased in   2014   primarily due to lower crude oil volumes, and lower refined product and crude oil prices. The decrease between 2013 and 2012 was mainly due to lower refined product prices and lower crude oil volumes and prices. 

Income from equity affiliates decreased in   2014   from   2013   mainly due to lower upstream-related earnings from Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan, Petropiar and Petroboscan in Venezuela, and Angola LNG. Partially offsetting these effects were higher downstream-related earnings from GS Caltex in South Korea, higher earnings from CPChem and the absence of 2013 impairments of power-related affiliates.  
  Income from equity affiliates increased in   2013   from   2012   mainly due to higher upstream-related earnings from Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan and Petropiar in Venezuela, and higher earnings from CPChem, partially offset by 2013 impairments of power-related affiliates.

Other income of   $4.4 billion   in   2014   included net gains from asset sales of $3.6 billion before-tax. Other income in   2013   and   2012   included net gains from asset sales of $710 million and $4.2 billion before-tax, respectively. Interest income was approximately $145 million in   2014  , $136 million in   2013   and $166 million in   2012  . Foreign currency effects increased other income by $277 million in   2014  , while increasing other income by $103 million in   2013   and decreasing other income by $207 million in   2012  .  

Crude oil and product purchases of   $119.7 billion   were down in   2014   mainly due to lower crude oil and refined products prices, along with lower crude oil volumes. Crude oil and product purchases in   2013   decreased by $6.1 billion from the prior year, mainly due to lower prices for refined products and lower volumes for crude oil, partially offset by higher refined product volumes.  

Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses increased   $642 million   between   2014   and   2013  . The increase included higher employee compensation and benefit costs of $360 million, primarily related to a buyout of a legacy pension obligation.  Also contributing to the increase was higher transportation costs of $350 million, primarily reflecting the economic buyout of a long-term contractual obligation, and higher environmental expenses related to a mining asset of $300 million. Partially offsetting the increase were lower fuel expenses of $360 million.  
  Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses increased   $1.8 billion   between   2013   and   2012   mainly due to higher employee compensation and benefits costs of $720 million, construction and maintenance expenses of $590 million, and professional services costs of $500 million. 

Exploration expenses in   2014   increased from   2013   mainly due to higher charges for well write-offs, partially offset by lower geological and geophysical expenses. Exploration expenses in   2013   increased from   2012   mainly due to higher charges for well write-offs.  

Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses increased in   2014   from   2013   mainly due to higher depreciation rates and impairments for certain oil and gas producing fields, and the impairment of a mining asset. The increase in   2013   from   2012   was mainly due to higher depreciation rates for certain oil and gas producing fields, higher upstream impairments and higher accretion expense, partially offset by lower production levels. 

Taxes other than on income decreased in   2014   from   2013   mainly due to a decrease in duty expense in South Africa along with lower consumer excise taxes in Thailand, reflecting lower sales volumes at both locations. Taxes other than on income increased in   2013   from   2012   primarily due to the consolidation of the 64 percent-owned Star Petroleum Refining Company, beginning June 2012, and higher consumer excise taxes in the United States.  
   
 Effective income tax rates were   38 percent   in   2014  ,   40 percent   in   2013   and   43 percent   in   2012  . The decrease in the effective tax rate between   2014   and   2013   primarily resulted from the impact of changes in jurisdictional mix and equity earnings, and

   the tax effects related to the 2014 sale of interests in Chad and Cameroon, partially offset by other one-time and ongoing tax charges.  
  The rate decreased between   2013   and   2012   primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in international upstream operations. The lower international upstream effective tax rate was driven by a greater portion of equity income in 2013 than in 2012 (equity income is included as part of before-tax income and is generally recorded net of income taxes) and foreign currency remeasurement impacts.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  Cash, Cash Equivalents, Time Deposits and Marketable Securities     Total balances were   $13.2   billion and   $16.5 billion   at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in   2014   was   $31.5   billion, compared with   $35.0 billion   in   2013   and $38.8 billion in   2012  . Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately   $0.4   billion, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of   $5.7   billion in   2014  , $1.1 billion in   2013  , and $2.8 billion in   2012  . 
  Restricted cash of   $1.5 billion   and   $1.2 billion   at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as  Deferred charges and other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with tax payments, upstream abandonment activities, funds held in escrow for asset acquisitions and capital investment projects.  
  Dividends   Dividends paid to common stockholders were   $7.9   billion in   2014  ,   $7.5   billion in   2013   and   $6.8   billion in   2012  . In April 2014, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 7 percent to $1.07 per common share.  
  Debt and Capital Lease Obligations     Total debt and capital lease obligations were   $27.8   billion at   December 31, 2014  , up from $20.4 billion at year-end   2013  .  
  The   $7.4 billion     increase   in total debt and capital lease obligations during   2014   was primarily due to funding the company s capital investment program, which included several large projects in the construction phase. The company completed a $4 billion bond issuance in November 2014, timed in part to take advantage of historically low interest rates. The company s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $11.8 billion at   December 31, 2014  , compared with $8.4 billion at year-end   2013  . Of these amounts, $8.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at the end of both periods. At year-end   2014  , settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in   2015  , as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.  
  Chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in November 2015 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.  

The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company s debt, and the company s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation and Texaco Capital Inc. All of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA by Standard   Poor s Corporation and Aa1 by Moody s Investors Service. The company s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard   Poor s and P-l by Moody s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.  
    FS-  -12 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

   The company s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company can also modify capital spending plans to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and with the intent to maintain the company s high-quality debt ratings.  
  Committed Credit Facilities   Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Short-Term Debt, on page FS-49. 
  Common Stock Repurchase Program   In July 2010, the Board of Directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. During   2014  , the company purchased   41.5   million common shares for   $5.0   billion. From the inception of the program through   2014  , the company had purchased   180.9   million shares for   $20.0   billion. Given the change in market conditions, the company is suspending the share repurchase program for 2015. 
    Capital and Exploratory Expenditures    
  Capital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows: 

Total expenditures for   2014   were $  40.3   billion, including $  3.5   billion for the company s share of equity-affiliate expenditures, which did not require cash outlays by the company. In   2013   and   2012  , expenditures were $  41.9   billion and $  34.2   billion, respectively, including the company s share of affiliates  expenditures of $  2.7   billion and $  2.1   billion, respectively. The increase in expenditures between 2013 and 2012 included approximately $4 billion for major resource acquisitions in Argentina, Australia, the Permian Basin and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, along with the additional acreage in the Duvernay Shale and interests in the Kitimat LNG Project. In addition, work progressed on a number of major capital projects, particularly two Australian LNG projects and two deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects.  
  Of the $  40.3   billion of expenditures in   2014  ,   92   percent, or $  37.1   billion, was related to upstream activities. Approximately,   90   percent was expended for upstream operations in   2013   and   2012  . International upstream accounted for   76   percent of the worldwide upstream investment in   2014  ,   78   percent in   2013   and   72   percent in   2012  .  
  The company estimates that   2015   capital and exploratory expenditures will be $35.0 billion, including $4.0 billion of spending by affiliates. This planned reduction, compared to 2014 expenditures, is in large part a response to current market conditions.  Approximately 90 percent of the total, or $31.6 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities. Approximately $23.4 billion, or 74 percent, of this amount is for projects outside the United States. Spending in   2015   is primarily focused on major development projects in Angola, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Russia, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Also included is funding for enhancing recovery and mitigating natural field declines for currently-producing assets, development of shale and tight resources, and focused exploration and appraisal activities. The company will continue to monitor crude oil market conditions, and will further modify spending plans, as needed.  
  Worldwide downstream spending in   2015   is estimated at $2.8 billion, with $2.0 billion for projects in the United States. About half of these investments are expected to be funded by CPChem for petrochemicals projects in the United States. Additional capital outlays include projects at U.S. and international refineries. 
  Investments in technology companies and other corporate businesses in   2015   are budgeted at $0.6 billion.  
  Noncontrolling Interests   The company had noncontrolling interests of   $1.2 billion   at December 31,   2014   compared to   $1.3 billion   at year-end   2013  . Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled   $47 million   and   $99 million   in   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  
  Pension Obligations     Information related to pension plan contributions is included on page FS-56 in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading  Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.

   Financial Ratios      

  Current Ratio         current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end   2014  , the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately   $8.1 billion  .  
  Interest Coverage Ratio         income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company s interest coverage ratio in   2014   was lower than   2013   and   2012   due to lower income.  
  Debt Ratio     total debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders' Equity, which indicates the company s leverage. The company's debt ratio in   2014   was higher than   2013   and   2012   as the company took on more debt to finance its ongoing investment program, partially offset by a higher stockholders' equity balance. 
         
  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Guarantees and Other Contingencies    
  Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements     The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers  financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are:   2015     $3.6 billion;   2016     $3.0 billion;   2017     $2.3 billion;   2018     $2.1 billion;   2019     $1.6 billion; 2020 and after   $4.5 billion. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $3.7 billion in   2014  , $3.6 billion in   2013   and $3.6 billion in   2012  .  
  The following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations:

    Does not include amounts related to the company s income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. The company is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods in which such liabilities may become payable. The company does not expect settlement of such liabilities to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity in any single period. 
               3   
    $8.0 billion of short-term debt that the company expects to refinance is included in long-term debt. The repayment schedule above reflects the projected repayment of the entire amounts in the   2016     2017   period. 
               4   
    Does not include commodity purchase obligations that are not fixed or determinable. These obligations are generally monetized in a relatively short period of time through sales transactions or similar agreements with third parties. Examples include obligations to purchase LNG, regasified natural gas and refinery products at indexed prices.

   Direct Guarantees 

The company s guarantee of   $485 million   is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate   13  -year remaining term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this guarantee.  
  Indemnifications     Information related to indemnifications is included on page FS-57 in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading  Indemnifications.   
    Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk    
  The market risk associated with the company s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A, of the company s   2014   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  Derivative Commodity Instruments   Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in   2014  .  
  The company s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company s risk management policies, which are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the company s Board of Directors.  
  Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron s derivative commodity instruments in   2014   was not material to the company's results of operations.  
  The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method with a 95 percent confidence level as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. A one-day holding period is used on the assumption that market-risk positions can be liquidated or hedged within one day. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company's primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31,   2014   and   2013   was not material to the company's cash flows or results of operations.  
  Foreign Currency     The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31,   2014  . 
  Interest Rates     The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end   2014  , the company had no interest rate swaps.  
    Transactions With Related Parties    
  Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to  Other Information  in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, page FS-41, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

  Environmental     The following table displays the annual changes to the company s before-tax environmental remediation reserves, including those for federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws.  

The company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately   $15.1 billion   for asset retirement obligations at year-end   2014   related primarily to upstream properties.  
  For the company s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation.

    Environmental Matters  
  Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These regulatory requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Regulations intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change also continue to evolve and include those at the international or multinational (such as the mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union's Emissions Trading System), national (such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emission standards and renewable transportation fuel content requirements or domestic market-based programs such as those in effect in Australia and New Zealand), and state or regional (such as California's Global Warming Solutions Act) levels. Regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the national and state levels. 
  Most of the costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. It is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply with existing and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the company's liquidity or financial position.

   Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. In addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards.  
  Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in   2014   at approximately $2.6 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $0.9 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.7 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites. 
  For   2015  , total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.9 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites. 
      
  Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions  
  Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.  
  The discussion in this section of  critical  accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein:  
           1. 
    the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and 
              2. 
    the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company s financial condition or operating performance is material. 
     The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed  critical,  and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated  critical  estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows:  
  Oil and Gas Reserves   Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs.  
  The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron's Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following: 
           1. 
    Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During   2014  , Chevron's UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD A) for oil and gas properties was   $13.0 billion  , and proved developed reserves at the beginning of   2014   were 4.8 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD A in   2014   would have increased by approximately   $690 million  . 
       FS-  -17 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

            2. 
    Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. In assessing whether the property is impaired, the fair value of the property must be determined. Frequently, a discounted cash flow methodology is the best estimate of fair value. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see   Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates   below. 
     Refer to Table V,  Reserve Quantity Information,  beginning on page FS-65, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ending December 31,   2014  , and to Table VII,  Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves  on page FS-71 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31,   2014  .  
  This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-28, which includes a description of the  successful efforts  method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities. 
  Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates   The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.  
  Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are consistent with the company s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 9 beginning on page FS-34 and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," beginning on page FS-28. 
  The company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company's crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets  associated carrying values. 
  Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company s carrying value. Differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity analysis.  
  No material individual impairments of PP E or Investments were recorded for the three years ending December 31,   2014  . A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company s PP E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired.  
  Asset Retirement Obligations   In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for   2014   is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some  
    FS-  -18 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

   assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 24 on page FS-59 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations. 
  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans   Note 22, beginning on page FS-52, includes information on the funded status of the company s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions. 
  The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the Company s processes to develop these assumptions is included on page FS-54 in Note 22 under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the world's financial markets. 
  For   2014  , the company used an expected long-term rate of return of   7.5   percent and a discount rate of   4.3   percent for U.S. pension plans. For the 10 years ending December 31,   2014  , actual asset returns averaged 6.0 percent for the plan. The actual return for   2014   was more than 7.5 percent. Additionally, with the exception of two years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded   7.5   percent during each year. 
  Total pension expense for   2014   was   $1.2 billion  . An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 39 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for   2014   by approximately $98 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for   2014   by approximately $229 million.  
  The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31,   2014  , was a net liability of approximately   $4.7 billion  . An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31,   2014  , the company used a discount rate of   3.7   percent to measure the obligations for the U.S. pension plans. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 63 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $403 million, which would have decreased the plan s underfunded status from approximately $1.6 billion to $1.2 billion.  
  For the company s OPEB plans, expense for   2014   was   $219 million  , and the total liability, which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of   2014  , was   $3.7 billion  . For the main U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a 4.7 percent discount rate to measure expense in   2014  , and a 4.1 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31,   2014  . Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on   2014   OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of   2014  . For information on the sensitivity of the health care cost-trend rate, refer to FS-54 in Note 22 under the heading  Other Benefit Assumptions.   
  Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page FS-53 in Note 22 for a description of the method used to amortize the   $7.2 billion   of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31,   2014  , and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during   2015  . In addition, information related to company contributions is included on Page FS-56 in Note 22 under the heading  Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.   
  Contingent Losses   Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.  
  Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as  Operating expenses  or  Selling,  
    FS-  -19 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

   general and administrative expenses  on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is  more likely than not  (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 23 beginning on page FS-57. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31,   2014  .  
  An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation: 
  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in     Internal Control   Integrated Framework     (  2013  )     issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1    
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  General   The company s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.   
  Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies   The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than   50   percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. As part of that accounting, the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the company s proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliate s equity currently in income.  
  Investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee s financial performance, and the company s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.  
  Differences between the company s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company s share of the affiliate s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate s historical book values.  
  Derivatives     The majority of the company s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.  
  Short-Term Investments   All short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the company s cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as  Cash equivalents.  Bank time deposits with maturities greater than   90   days are reported as  Time deposits.  The balance of short-term investments is reported as  Marketable securities  and is marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in  Other comprehensive income.   
  Inventories     Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market.  Materials, supplies and other  inventories generally are stated at average cost.  
  Properties, Plant and Equipment     The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized.  
    FS-  -28 

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  
  Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts 

Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 20, beginning on page FS-49, for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.  
  Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net before-tax cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net before-tax cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties in the United States, the company generally performs an impairment review on an individual field basis. Outside the United States, reviews are performed on a country, concession, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental  Depreciation, depletion and amortization  expense.  
  Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 9, beginning on page FS-34, relating to fair value measurements.  
  The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 24, on page FS-59, relating to AROs.  
  Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Periodic valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.  
  The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets.  
  Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as  Other income.   
  Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.  
  Goodwill   Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.  
  Environmental Expenditures   Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.  
  Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For the company s U.S. and Canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future remediation commitment will be required. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  
  Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts 

For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares.  
  The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.  
  Currency Translation   The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in  Currency translation adjustment  on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.  
  Revenue Recognition   Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from properties in which Chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized using the entitlement method. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. The associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the Consolidated Statement of Income, on page FS-23. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in  Purchased crude oil and products  on the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
  Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation     The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the company s Long-Term Incentive Plan have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The company amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line basis.

  Information Relating to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 

The    Net (increase) decrease in operating working capital    includes reductions of   $58  ,   $79   and   $98   for excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. These amounts are offset by an equal amount in    Net purchases of treasury shares  .  "Other" includes changes in postretirement benefits obligations and other long-term liabilities.  
  The    Net purchases of treasury shares    represents the cost of common shares acquired less the cost of shares issued for share-based compensation plans. Purchases totaled   $5,006  ,   $5,004   and   $5,004   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively.

Note 9    
  Fair Value Measurements  
  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows:  
  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. For the company, Level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are willing to transact at the exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively traded.  
  Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. For the company, Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained through third-party broker quotes and prices that can be corroborated with other observable inputs for substantially the complete term of a contract.  
  Level 3: Unobservable inputs. The company does not use Level 3 inputs for any of its recurring fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. 
  The tables on the next page show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31,   2014  , and December 31,   2013  .  
  Marketable Securities   The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31,   2014  .  
  Derivatives     The company records its derivative instruments   other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale   on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information.  
  Properties, Plant and Equipment   The company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties and a mining asset in   2014  .  The company did not have any material long-lived assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in   2013  . 
  Investments and Advances   The company did not have any material investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in   2014   or   2013  .

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis    

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value   The company holds cash equivalents and bank time deposits in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of   90   days or less and money market funds.  Cash and cash equivalents  had carrying/fair values of   $12,785   and   $16,245   at December 31,   2014  , and December 31,   2013  , respectively. The instruments held in  Time deposits  are bank time deposits with maturities greater than   90   days, and had carrying/fair values of    $8   at both December 31,   2014  , and December 31,   2013  . The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31,   2014  .  
  "Cash and cash equivalents  do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of   $1,474   and   $1,210   at December 31,   2014  , and December 31,   2013  , respectively. At December 31,   2014  , these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds related to upstream abandonment activities, funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and asset acquisitions, and tax payments, which are reported in  Deferred charges and other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt of   $15,960   and   $11,960   at   December 31, 2014  , and   December 31, 2013  , had estimated fair values of   $16,450   and   $12,267  , respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is   $15,727   and classified as Level 1. The fair value of the other bonds is   $723   and classified as Level 2.    
  The carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31,   2014   and   2013  , were not material.  
      
  Note 10  
  Financial and Derivative Instruments 
  Derivative Commodity Instruments   Chevron is exposed to market risks related to price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks.  
  The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. From time to time, the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes.  
  The company s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. None of the company s derivative instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the company s affiliates make such designation. The company s derivatives are not material to the company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities.

  Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts 

The company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the  over-the-counter  markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.  
  Derivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31,   2014  , December 31,   2013  , and December 31,   2012  , and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are as follows:

Consolidated Statement of Income: The Effect of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments    

The table below represents gross and net derivative assets and liabilities subject to netting agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  . 
  Consolidated Balance Sheet: The Effect of Netting Derivative Assets and Liabilities 

Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for "a right of offset."   
  Concentrations of Credit Risk   The company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company s short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies limit the company s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company s counterparties in derivative instruments.  
  The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company s diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the company s broad customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral instruments to support sales to customers.

  Operating Segments and Geographic Data 
  Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into   two   business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company s  reportable segments  and  operating segments.  Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include mining activities, power and energy services, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.  
  The company s segments are managed by  segment managers  who report to the  chief operating decision maker  (CODM). The segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available. 
  The company s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the company s operations are reported as "International  (outside the United States).

Segment Earnings     The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in  All Other.  Earnings by major operating area are presented in the following table:  

Segment Assets     Segment assets do not include intercompany investments or receivables. Assets at year-end   2014   and   2013   are as follows: 

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues     Operating segment sales and other operating revenues, including internal transfers, for the years   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , are presented in the table that follows. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices.  
  Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived

  Investments and Advances    
  Equity in earnings, together with investments in and advances to companies accounted for using the equity method and other investments accounted for at or below cost, is shown in the following table. For certain equity affiliates, Chevron pays its share of some income taxes directly. For such affiliates, the equity in earnings does not include these taxes, which are reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income as  Income tax expense.   

Descriptions of major affiliates, including significant differences between the company s carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows:  
  Tengizchevroil   Chevron has a   50 percent   equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan. At December 31,   2014  , the company s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about   $150   higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO s net assets. See Note 8, on page FS-34, for summarized financial information for   100 percent   of TCO.  
  Petropiar   Chevron has a   30 percent   interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the Hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project in Venezuela s Orinoco Belt. At December 31,   2014  , the company s carrying value of its investment in Petropiar was approximately   $160   less than the amount of underlying equity in Petropiar s net assets. The difference represents the excess of Chevron s underlying equity in Petropiar s net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture.  
  Caspian Pipeline Consortium   Chevron has a   15 percent   interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a variable interest entity, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak. The company has investments and advances totaling   $1,487  , which includes long-term loans of   $1,328   at year-end   2014  . The loans were provided to fund   30 percent   of the initial pipeline construction. The company is not the primary beneficiary of the consortium because it does not direct activities of the consortium and only receives its proportionate share of the financial returns.  
  Petroboscan   Chevron has a   39.2 percent   interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company which operates the Boscan Field in Venezuela. At December 31,   2014  , the company s carrying value of its investment in Petroboscan was approximately   $160   higher than the amount of underlying equity in Petroboscan s net assets. The difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by Chevron over its underlying equity in Petroboscan s net assets.  
  Angola LNG Limited     Chevron has a   36.4 percent   interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.

  Litigation  
  MTBE   Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to   seven   pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. The company s ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States.  
  Ecuador     Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpet s ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a   three  -year remediation program at a cost of   $40  . After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations.  
  Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that Texpet s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuador s failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and Petroecuador s further conduct since assuming full control over the operations.  
  In 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending that the court assess   $18,900  , which would, according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for Petroecuador. The engineer s report also asserted that an additional   $8,400   could be assessed against Chevron for unjust enrichment. In 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case was recused. In 2010, Chevron moved to strike the mining engineer s report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the United States indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineer s independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct. In August 2010, the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineer s report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within   45 days  . Chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement.  
  In September 2010, Chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should be assessed against it. The plaintiffs  submission, which relied in part on the mining engineer s report, took the position that damages are between approximately   $16,000   and   $76,000   and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately   $5,000   and   $38,000  . The next day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. Chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of Chevron s prior recusal petition, and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved. In October 2010, Chevron s motion to recuse the judge was granted. A new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judge s order closing the evidentiary phase of the case. On December 17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment.

On February 14, 2011, the provincial court in Lago Agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case. The court rejected Chevron s defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion. The judgment assessed approximately   $8,600   in damages and approximately   $900   as an award for the plaintiffs  representatives. It also assessed an additional amount of approximately   $8,600   in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within   15 days   of the judgment, which Chevron did not do. On February 17, 2011, the plaintiffs appealed the judgment, seeking increased damages, and on March 11, 2011, Chevron appealed the judgment seeking to have the judgment nullified. On January 3, 2012, an appellate panel in the provincial court affirmed the February 14, 2011 decision and ordered that Chevron pay additional attorneys  fees in the amount of    0.10%   of the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment.  The plaintiffs filed a petition to clarify and amplify the appellate decision on January 6, 2012, and the court issued a ruling in response on January 13, 2012, purporting to clarify and amplify its January 3, 2012 ruling, which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately   $8,600   in punitive damages was within   15 days   of the clarification ruling, or February 3, 2012. Chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at trial. On January 20, 2012, Chevron appealed (called a petition for cassation) the appellate panel s decision to Ecuador s National Court of Justice. As part of the appeal, Chevron requested the suspension of any requirement that Chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement under Ecuadorian law of the judgment during the cassation appeal. On February 17, 2012, the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted Chevron s cassation appeal in a procedural step necessary for the National Court of Justice to hear the appeal. The provincial court appellate panel denied Chevron s request for suspension of the requirement that Chevron post a bond and stated that it would not comply with the First and Second Interim Awards of the international arbitration tribunal discussed below. On March 29, 2012, the matter was transferred from the provincial court to the National Court of Justice, and on November 22, 2012, the National Court agreed to hear Chevron's cassation appeal. On August 3, 2012, the provincial court in Lago Agrio approved a court-appointed liquidator s report on damages that calculated the total judgment in the case to be   $19,100  . On November 13, 2013, the National Court ratified the judgment but nullified the   $8,600   punitive damage assessment, resulting in a judgment of   $9,500  . On December 23, 2013, Chevron appealed the decision to the Ecuador Constitutional Court, Ecuador's highest court, which agreed to consider the appeal on March 20, 2014.   
  On July 2, 2013, the provincial court in Lago Agrio issued an embargo order in Ecuador ordering that any funds to be paid by the Government of Ecuador to Chevron to satisfy a   $96   award issued in an unrelated action by an arbitral tribunal presiding in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law must be paid to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. The award was issued by the tribunal under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty in an action filed in 2006 in connection with seven breach of contract cases that Texpet filed against the Government of Ecuador between 1991 and 1993. The Government of Ecuador has moved to set aside the tribunal's award. On September 26, 2014, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands issued an opinion denying Ecuador s set aside request. A Federal District Court for the District of Columbia confirmed the tribunal's award, and the Government of Ecuador has appealed the District Court's decision. 
  Chevron has no assets in Ecuador and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' lawyers have stated in press releases and through other media that they will seek to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in various countries and otherwise disrupt Chevron's operations. On May 30, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed an action against Chevron Corporation, Chevron Canada Limited, and Chevron Canada Finance Limited in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On May 1, 2013, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that the Court has jurisdiction over Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited for purposes of the action, but stayed the action due to the absence of evidence that Chevron Corporation has assets in Ontario. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed that decision. On December 17, 2013, the Court of Appeals for Ontario affirmed the lower court s decision on jurisdiction and set aside the stay,  allowing the recognition and enforcement action to be heard in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Chevron appealed the decision concerning jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of Canada and, on January 16, 2014, the Court of Appeals for Ontario granted Chevron s motion to stay the recognition and enforcement proceeding pending a decision on the admissibility of the Supreme Court appeal. On April 3, 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada granted Chevron s and Chevron Canada Limited s petitions to appeal the Ontario Court of Appeal s decision. On April 8, 2014, Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited filed their notices of appeal with the Canada Supreme Court. 
  On June 27, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed an action against Chevron Corporation in the Superior Court of Justice in Brasilia, Brazil, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On October 15, 2012, the provincial court in Lago Agrio issued an ex parte embargo order that purports to order the seizure of assets belonging to separate Chevron subsidiaries in Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia. On November 6, 2012, at the request of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, a court in Argentina issued a Freeze Order against Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and another Chevron subsidiary, Ingeniero Norberto

Priu, requiring shares of both companies to be "embargoed," requiring third parties to withhold   40 percent   of any payments due to Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and ordering banks to withhold   40 percent   of the funds in Chevron Argentina S.R.L. bank accounts. On December 14, 2012, the Argentinean court rejected a motion to revoke the Freeze Order but modified it by ordering that third parties are not required to withhold funds but must report their payments. The court also clarified that the Freeze Order relating to bank accounts excludes taxes. On January 30, 2013, an appellate court upheld the Freeze Order, but on June 4, 2013 the Supreme Court of Argentina revoked the Freeze Order in its entirety. On December 12, 2013, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs served Chevron with notice of their filing of an enforcement proceeding in the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina. Chevron filed its answer on February 27, 2014. Chevron intends to vigorously defend against the proceeding. Chevron continues to believe the provincial court s judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in Ecuador, the United States and other countries. The company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence. Chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in Ecuador or any enforcement action. Chevron expects to continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability in the Ecuadorian courts and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions. 
  Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009 against the Republic of Ecuador before an arbitral tribunal presiding in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The claim alleges violations of the Republic of Ecuador s obligations under the United States Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet (described above), which are investment agreements protected by the BIT. Through the arbitration, Chevron and Texpet are seeking relief against the Republic of Ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation constitutes a violation of Ecuador s obligations under the BIT. On February 9, 2011, the Tribunal issued an Order for Interim Measures requiring the Republic of Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending further order of the Tribunal. On January 25, 2012, the Tribunal converted the Order for Interim Measures into an Interim Award. Chevron filed a renewed application for further interim measures on January 4, 2012, and the Republic of Ecuador opposed Chevron s application and requested that the existing Order for Interim Measures be vacated on January 9, 2012. On February 16, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Second Interim Award mandating that the Republic of Ecuador take all measures necessary (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and without Ecuador of the judgment against Chevron and, in particular, to preclude any certification by the Republic of Ecuador that would cause the judgment to be enforceable against Chevron. On February 27, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Third Interim Award confirming its jurisdiction to hear Chevron's arbitration claims. On February 7, 2013, the Tribunal issued its Fourth Interim Award in which it declared that the Republic of Ecuador  has violated the First and Second Interim Awards under the [BIT], the UNCITRAL Rules and international law in regard to the finalization and enforcement subject to execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and outside Ecuador, including (but not limited to) Canada, Brazil and Argentina.  The Republic of Ecuador filed in the District Court of the Hague a request to set aside the Tribunal s Interim Awards and the First Partial Award (described below).  Chevron filed its answer to the set aside request on December 31, 2014.    
  The Tribunal has divided the merits phase of the proceeding into three phases. On September 17, 2013, the Tribunal issued its First Partial Award from Phase One, finding that the settlement agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet applied to Texpet and Chevron, released Texpet and Chevron from claims based on "collective" or "diffuse" rights arising from Texpet's operations in the former concession area and precluded third parties from asserting collective/diffuse rights environmental claims relating to Texpet's operations in the former concession area but did not preclude individual claims for personal harm. Chevron awaits a ruling from the Tribunal about whether the claims of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are individual or collective/diffuse. The Tribunal had set Phase Two to begin on January 20, 2014 to hear Chevron's denial of justice claims, but on January 2, 2014, the Tribunal postponed Phase Two and held a procedural hearing on January 20-21, 2014. The Tribunal held a hearing on April 29-30, 2014 to address remaining issues relating to Phase One. It also set a hearing on April 20 to May 6, 2015 to address Phase Two issues. The Tribunal has not set a date for Phase Three, which will be the damages phase of the arbitration. 
  Through a series of U.S. court proceedings initiated by Chevron to obtain discovery relating to the Lago Agrio litigation and the BIT arbitration, Chevron obtained evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. In February 2011, Chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters, alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other state laws. Through the civil lawsuit, Chevron is seeking relief that includes a

declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. On March 7, 2011, the Federal District Court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending resolution of Chevron s civil lawsuit by the Federal District Court. On May 31, 2011, the Federal District Court severed claims   one through eight   of Chevron s complaint from the   ninth   claim for declaratory relief and imposed a discovery stay on claims one through eight pending a trial on the ninth claim for declaratory relief. On September 19, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction, stayed the trial on Chevron s ninth claim, a claim for declaratory relief, that had been set for November 14, 2011, and denied the defendants  mandamus petition to recuse the judge hearing the lawsuit. The Second Circuit issued its opinion on January 26, 2012 ordering the dismissal of Chevron s ninth claim for declaratory relief. On February 16, 2012, the Federal District Court lifted the stay on claims one through eight, and on October 18, 2012, the Federal District Court set a trial date of October 15, 2013. On March 22, 2013, Chevron settled its claims against Stratus Consulting, and on April 12, 2013 sworn declarations by representatives of Stratus Consulting were filed with the Court admitting their role and that of the plaintiffs' attorneys in drafting the environmental report of the mining engineer appointed by the provincial court in Lago Agrio. On September 26, 2013, the Second Circuit denied the defendants' Petition for Writ of Mandamus to recuse the judge hearing the case and to collaterally estop Chevron from seeking a declaration that the Lago Agrio judgment was obtained through fraud and other unlawful conduct. The trial commenced on October 15, 2013 and concluded on November 22, 2013. On March 4, 2014, the Federal District Court entered a judgment in favor of Chevron, prohibiting the defendants from seeking to enforce the Lago Agrio judgment in the United States and further prohibiting them from profiting from their illegal acts. The defendants filed their notices of appeal on March 18, 2014. 
  The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects associated with the Ecuadorian judgment, the 2008 engineer s report on alleged damages and the September 2010 plaintiffs  submission on alleged damages, management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

  Taxes  

In   2014  , before-tax income for U.S. operations, including related corporate and other charges, was   $6,296  , compared with before-tax income of   $4,672   and   $8,456   in   2013   and   2012  , respectively. For international operations, before-tax income was   $24,906  ,   $31,233   and   $37,876   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. U.S. federal income tax expense was reduced by   $68  ,   $175   and   $165   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively, for business tax credits.

The reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and the company s effective income tax rate is detailed in the following table:    

  The company s effective tax rate decreased from   39.9 percent   in   2013   to   38.1 percent   in   2014  . The decrease primarily resulted from the impact of changes in jurisdictional mix and equity earnings, and the tax effects related to the 2014 sale of interests in Chad and Cameroon, partially offset by other one-time and ongoing tax charges. 
  The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis and classifies those net amounts as current or noncurrent based on the balance sheet classification of the related assets or liabilities. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:  

Deferred tax liabilities at the end of   2014   increased by approximately   $3,300   from year-end   2013  . The increase was primarily related to increased temporary differences for property, plant and equipment. Deferred tax assets increased by approximately   $1,900   in 2014. Increases primarily related to increased temporary differences for employee benefits.  
  The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. It reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of   2014  , the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately   $5,535   and tax credit carryforwards of approximately   $1,190  , primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from   2015   through   2029  . U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of   $11,867   will expire between   2015   and   2024  . 
  At December 31,   2014   and   2013  , deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:  

FS-  -46 

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  
  Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts 

Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately   $35,700   at December 31,   2014  . This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. At the end of   2014  , deferred income taxes were recorded for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations where indefinite reinvestment of the earnings is not planned. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.  
  Uncertain Income Tax Positions   The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management s assessment is that the position is  more likely than not  (i.e., a likelihood   greater than 50 percent  ) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term  tax position  in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods.  
  The following table indicates the changes to the company s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  . The term  unrecognized tax benefits  in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included.  

The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits between December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the expiration of certain U.S. foreign tax credits in 2014, which had no impact on the company's results of operations. 
  Approximately   68 percent   of the   $3,552   of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,   2014  , would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.  
  Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31,   2014  . For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States     2008  , Nigeria     2000  , Angola     2001  , Saudi Arabia     2012   and Kazakhstan     2007  .  
  The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next   12   months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits. 
  On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as  Income tax expense.  As of December 31,   2014  , accruals of   $233   for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accruals of   $215   as of year-end   2013  . Income tax expense (benefit) associated with interest and penalties was   $4  ,   $(42)   and   $145   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively.

  Long-Term Debt    
  Total long-term debt, excluding capital leases, at December 31,   2014  , was   $23,960  . The company s long-term debt outstanding at year-end   2014   and   2013   was as follows:  

Chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in 2015. This registration statement is for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.

  Short-Term Debt    

Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date.  
  The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31,   2014  , the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt.  
  At December 31,   2014  , the company had   $8,000   in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in   December 2016  , that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at December 31,   2014  .  
  At both December 31,   2014   and   2013  , the company classified   $8,000   of short-term debt as long-term. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.

  New Accounting Standards 
  Revenue Recognition (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09)     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which becomes effective for the company January 1, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The standard provides that an entity should recognize revenue to align with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU, which replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP, provides a five-step model for recognition of revenue, guidance on the accounting for certain costs of obtaining or fulfilling contracts with customers and specific disclosure requirements. Transition guidance permits either retrospective application or presentation of the cumulative effect at the adoption date. The company is reviewing the requirements of the ASU to determine the transition method it will apply and to update its assessments developed throughout the FASB s deliberation period. The company is evaluating the effect of the standard on the company s consolidated financial statements.

  Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells    
  The company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and (b) the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense.

The following table indicates the changes to the company s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31,   2014  : 

*       Represents property sales. 
  The following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling.  

*       Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both. 
  Of the   $2,673   of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31,   2014  ,   $1,460   (  21   projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities under way or firmly planned for the near future. The   $1,213   balance is related to   30   projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not under way or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development. 
  The projects for the   $1,213   referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects  economic viability: (a)   $289   (  six   projects)   undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within   two years  ; (b)   $213   (  three   projects)   development concept under review by government; (c)   $600   (  10   projects)   development alternatives under review; (d)   $111   (  11   projects)   miscellaneous activities for projects with smaller amounts suspended. While progress was being made on all   51   projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. Approximately half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next   five years  .  
  The   $2,673   of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31,   2014  , represents   209   exploratory wells in   51   projects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis:

  Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation  
  Compensation expense for stock options for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was   $287   (  $186   after tax),   $292   (  $190   after tax) and   $283   (  $184   after tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance units and restricted stock units was   $71   (  $46   after tax),   $223   (  $145   after tax) and   $177   (  $115   after tax) for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at   December 31, 2014  , or December 31,   2013  .

Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was   $527  ,   $553   and   $753  , respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were   $54  ,   $73   and   $101   for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively.  
  Cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was   $204  ,   $186   and   $123   for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively.  
  Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)   Awards under the LTIP may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May 2023, no more than   260 million   shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than   50 million   of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards outstanding as of   December 31, 2014  , the contractual terms vary between   three   years for the performance units and   10   years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights.  
  Unocal Share-Based Plans (Unocal Plans)     When Chevron acquired Unocal in August 2005, outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various Unocal Plans were exchanged for fully vested Chevron options and appreciation rights. These awards retained the same provisions as the original Unocal Plans. Unexercised awards began expiring in early 2010 and will continue to expire through early 2015. 
  The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions:  

1       Expected term is based on historical exercise and postvesting cancellation data. 
   2       Volatility rate is based on historical stock prices over an appropriate period, generally equal to the expected term. 
  A summary of option activity during   2014   is presented below:  

The total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market price) of options exercised during   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was   $398  ,   $445   and   $580  , respectively. During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these awards.  
  As of   December 31, 2014  , there was   $226   of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.7   years. 
  At January 1,   2014  , the number of LTIP performance units outstanding was equivalent to   2,531,270   shares. During   2014  ,   772,800   units were granted,   967,234   units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and   70,884   units were forfeited. At   December 31, 2014  , units outstanding were   2,265,952  . The fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was   $212  , and was measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method. In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under various LTIP and former Unocal programs totaled approximately   3.3 million   equivalent shares as of   December 31, 2014  . A liability of   $78   was recorded for these awards.

Note 22    
  Employee Benefit Plans    
  The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company s other investment alternatives.  
  The company also sponsors other postretirement (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. Medical coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees in the company s main U.S. medical plan is secondary to Medicare (including Part D) and the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than   4 percent   each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.  
  The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
    The funded status of the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans for   2014   and   2013   follows:  

Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December 31,   2014   and   2013  , include:

Amounts recognized on a before-tax basis in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  for the company s pension and OPEB plans were   $7,417   and   $5,464   at the end of   2014   and   2013  , respectively. These amounts consisted of:  

The accumulated benefit obligations for all U.S. and international pension plans were   $12,833   and   $4,995  , respectively, at   December 31, 2014  , and   $10,876   and   $5,108  , respectively, at   December 31, 2013  . 
  Information for U.S. and international pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , was:  

The components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   are shown in the table below:  

Net actuarial losses recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  at   December 31, 2014  , for the company s U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans are being amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately   10  ,   12   and   15   years, respectively. These amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed   10 percent   of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. During   2015  , the company estimates actuarial losses of   $356  ,   $81   and   $34   will be amortized from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively. In addition, the company estimates an additional   $216   will be recognized from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  during   2015   related to lump-sum settlement costs from U.S. pension plans.

The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  at   December 31, 2014  , was approximately   5   and   9   years for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, and   7   years for other postretirement benefit plans. During   2015  , the company estimates prior service (credits) costs of   $(9)  ,   $22   and   $14   will be amortized from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively.  
    Assumptions   The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended December 31:  

Expected Return on Plan Assets   The company s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the company s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.  
  For   2014  , the company used an expected long-term rate of return of   7.5 percent   for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for   72 percent   of the company s pension plan assets. In both   2013   and   2012  , the company used a long-term rate of return of   7.5   for                                this plan.  
  The market-related value of assets of the major U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the   three   months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the   three  -month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.  
  Discount Rate   The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company's plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. At   December 31, 2014  , the company used a   3.7 percent   discount rate for the U.S. pension plans and   4.1 percent   for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates for these plans at the end of   2013   were   4.3   and   4.7 percent  , respectively, while in 2012 they were   3.6   and   3.9 percent   for these plans, respectively. 
  Other Benefit Assumptions   For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at   December 31, 2014  , for the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with   7.0 percent   in   2015   and gradually decline to   4.5 percent   for   2025   and beyond. For this measurement at   December 31, 2013  , the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with   7.3 percent   in   2014   and gradually declined to   4.5 percent   for   2025   and beyond. In both measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at   4 percent  .  
  Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs. The impact is mitigated by the   4 percent   cap on the company s medical contributions for the primary U.S. plan. A 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans:

Plan Assets and Investment Strategy   The fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value the pension assets is divided into three levels:  
  Level 1: Fair values of these assets are measured using unadjusted quoted prices for the assets or the prices of identical assets in active markets that the plans have the ability to access.  
  Level 2: Fair values of these assets are measured based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset; and inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data through correlation or other means. If the asset has a contractual term, the Level 2 input is observable for substantially the full term of the asset. The fair values for Level 2 assets are generally obtained from third-party broker quotes, independent pricing services and exchanges. 
  Level 3: Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable for these assets. Valuation may be performed using a financial model incorporating estimated inputs.  
    The fair value measurements of the company s pension plans for   2014   and   2013   are below: 

2   
    Collective Trusts/Mutual Funds for U.S. plans are entirely index funds; for International plans, they are mostly index funds. For these index funds, the Level 2 designation is partially based on the restriction that advance notification of redemptions, typically two business days, is required. 
               3   
    Mixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixed-income instruments in order to diversify and lower risk. 
               4   
    The year-end valuations of the U.S. real estate assets are based on internal appraisals by the real estate managers, which are updates of third-party appraisals that occur at least once a year for each property in the portfolio. 
               5   
    The  Other  asset class includes net payables for securities purchased but not yet settled (Level 1); dividends and interest- and tax-related receivables (Level 2); insurance contracts and investments in private-equity limited partnerships (Level 3).

The effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in Level 3 plan assets are outlined below:  

The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management.  
  The company s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise   91 percent   of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans  investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.  
  For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company's Benefit Plan Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities   40     70 percent  , Fixed Income and Cash   20     60 percent  , Real Estate   0     15 percent  , and Other   0     5 percent  . For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines, which are reviewed regularly: Equities   30  -  50   percent, Fixed Income and Cash   35     65 percent   and Real Estate   5  -  15   percent. The other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset class risk. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds.  
  The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.  
  Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments   In   2014  , the company contributed   $99   and   $293   to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In   2015  , the company expects contributions to be approximately   $350   to its U.S. plan and   $250   to its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.  
  The company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately   $198   in   2015  ;   $200   was paid in   2014  .  
  The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years:

Employee Savings Investment Plan   Eligible employees of Chevron and certain of its subsidiaries participate in the Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP). Compensation expense for the ESIP totaled   $316  ,   $163   and   $243   in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The amounts for ESIP expense in 2013 and 2012 are net of   $140   and   $43  , respectively, which reflect the value of common stock released from the former leveraged employee stock ownership plan (LESOP). LESOP debt was retired in 2013, and all remaining shares were released. 
  Benefit Plan Trusts   Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end   2014  , the trust contained   14.2 million   shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.  
  Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , trust assets of   $38   and   $40  , respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts.  
  Employee Incentive Plans   The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were   $965  ,   $871   and   $898   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in Note 21, beginning on page FS-50.  
    Note 23    
  Other Contingencies and Commitments  
    Income Taxes   The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 16, beginning on page FS-45, for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  
  Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for income and franchise taxes for all years under examination or subject to future examination. 
    Guarantees     The company s guarantee of   $485   is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate   13  -year remaining term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this guarantee.  
    Indemnifications   In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of   $200  , which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the   $200   obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997.  
  Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.  
    Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements     The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers  financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company s business. The aggregate  
    FS-  -57 

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  
  Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts 

approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are:   2015       $3,600  ;   2016       $3,000  ;   2017       $2,300  ;   2018       $2,100  ;   2019       $1,600  ; 2020 and after     $4,500  . A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately   $3,700   in   2014  ,   $3,600   in   2013   and   $3,600   in   2012  .  
    Environmental   The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether operating, closed or divested. These future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.  
  Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant impact on the company s competitive position relative to other U.S. or international petroleum or chemical companies.  
  Chevron s environmental reserve as of   December 31, 2014  , was   $1,683  . Included in this balance were remediation activities at approximately   164   sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws. The company s remediation reserve for these sites at year-end   2014   was   $456  . The federal Superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by the EPA or other regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties  costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.  
  Of the remaining year-end   2014   environmental reserves balance of   $1,227  ,   $868   related to the company s U.S. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals), chemical facilities, and pipelines. The remaining   $359   was associated with various sites in international downstream   $79  , upstream   $275   and other businesses   $5  . Liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the company s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. These and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.  
  The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end   2014   had a recorded liability that was material to the company s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.  
  It is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.  
  Refer to Note 24 for a discussion of the company s asset retirement obligations.  
    Other Contingencies     On April 26, 2010, a California appeals court issued a ruling related to the adequacy of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) supporting the issuance of certain permits by the city of Richmond, California, to replace and upgrade certain facilities at Chevron's refinery in Richmond. Settlement discussions with plaintiffs in the case ended late fourth quarter 2010, and on March 3, 2011, the trial court entered a final judgment and peremptory writ ordering the City to set aside the project EIR and conditional use permits and enjoining Chevron from any further work. On May 23, 2011, the company filed an application with the City Planning Department for a conditional use permit for a revised project to complete construction of the hydrogen plant, certain sulfur removal facilities and related infrastructure.

On June 10, 2011, the City published its Notice of Preparation of the revised EIR for the project, and on March 18, 2014, the revised draft EIR was published for public comment. The public comment period closed in May 2014, the final EIR was released on June 9, 2014, and on July 29, 2014, the Richmond City Council certified the EIR and approved a conditional use permit. The company is now seeking to secure the further necessary approvals to resume construction. Although the City Council has certified the EIR, management believes the outcomes associated with the project are uncertain. Due to the uncertainty of the company's future course of action, or potential outcomes of any action or combination of actions, management does not believe an estimate of the financial effects, if any, can be made at this time. 
  Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve.  
  The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.  
      
  Note 24    
  Asset Retirement Obligations  
  The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) as an asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the company s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates.  
  AROs are primarily recorded for the company s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation.  
  The following table indicates the changes to the company s before-tax asset retirement obligations in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  :  

In the table above, the amounts associated with "Revisions in estimated cash flows" generally reflect increasing costs for complex well abandonments and accelerated timing of abandonment. The long-term portion of the   $15,053   balance at the end of   2014   was   $14,246  .

Table V Reserve Quantity Information  
    
    Summary of Net Oil and Gas Reserves    

Reserves Governance   The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting - three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. The potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards. 
  Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate. 
  Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. 
  Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. 
    FS-  -65 

Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited 

Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the Manager of Corporate Reserves, a corporate department that reports directly to the Vice Chairman responsible for the company s worldwide exploration and production activities. The Manager of Corporate Reserves has more than 30 years  experience working in the oil and gas industry and a Master of Science in Petroleum Engineering degree from Stanford University. His experience includes more than 15 years of managing oil and gas reserves processes. He was chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee, served on the United Nations Expert Group on Resources Classification, and is a past member of the Joint Committee on Reserves Evaluator Training and the California Conservation Committee. He is an active member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and serves on the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. 
  All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates. The reserves activities are managed by two operating company-level reserves managers. These two reserves managers are not members of the RAC so as to preserve corporate-level independence. 
  The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units  recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the   Corporate Reserves Manual,   which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves. 
  During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company s Strategy and Planning Committee, whose members include the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board. 
  RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the   Corporate Reserves Manual. 
  Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions   In 2014, additions to Chevron s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide  reasonably certain  proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates. 
  Proved Undeveloped Reserves   At the end of 2014, proved undeveloped reserves totaled 5.0 billion barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE), a decrease of 174 million BOE from year-end 2013. The decrease was due to the transfer of 646 million BOE to proved developed and 2 million BOE in sales, partially offset by increases of 277 million BOE in extensions and discoveries, 169 million BOE in revisions, and 28 million BOE in improved recovery. 
  During 2014, investments totaling approximately $15.4 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $2.9 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. Australia accounted for about $7.1 billion of the total, mainly for development and construction activities at the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects. Expenditures of about $3.4 billion in the United States related primarily to various development activities in the Gulf of Mexico and the midcontinent region. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately $3.3 billion, primarily related to development projects of the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, and in Thailand. In Africa, about $2.8 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. Development activities in Canada and Brazil were primarily responsible for about $1.6 billion of expenditures in Other Americas.

Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.  
  At year-end 2014, the company held approximately 2.5 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 700 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to the Gorgon Project. The company is currently constructing liquefaction and other facilities in Australia to develop this natural gas. In Africa, approximately 400 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria.     Affiliates account for about 1.1 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more, with the majority related to the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion. 
  Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. For 2014, this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 44 percent and 46 percent. The consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period. 
  Proved Reserve Quantities   For the three years ending December 31, 2014, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company s control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest. 
  At December 31, 2014, proved reserves for the company were 11.1 billion BOE. The company s estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil for the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 are shown in the table on page FS-68. The company s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page FS-69. 
    Noteworthy changes in liquids proved reserves for 2012 through 2014 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page: 
  Revisions   In 2012, improved field performance and drilling associated with Gulf of Mexico projects accounted for the majority of the 104 million barrel increase in the United States. In Asia, drilling results across numerous assets drove the 97 million barrel increase. Improved field performance from various Nigeria and Angola producing assets was primarily responsible for the 66 million barrel increase in Africa. Improved plant efficiency for the TCO affiliate was responsible for a large portion of the 59 million barrel increase. 
  In 2013, improved field performance from various Nigeria and Angola producing assets was primarily responsible for the 94 million barrel increase in Africa. In Asia, drilling performance across numerous assets resulted in an 84 million barrel increase. Improved field performance and drilling associated with Gulf of Mexico projects and drilling in the Midland and Delaware basins accounted for the majority of the 55 million barrel increase in the United States. Synthetic oil reserves in Canada increased by 40 million barrels, primarily due to improved field performance. 
  In 2014, drilling in the Midland and Delaware basins and improved field performance and drilling in California accounted for the majority of the 90 million barrel increase in the United States. Improved field performance at various Nigeria fields was primarily responsible for the 74 million barrel increase in Africa. In Asia, drilling performance across numerous assets, primarily in Indonesia, resulted in the 80 million barrel increase.   
  Improved Recovery   In 2012, improved recovery increased reserves by 77 million barrels, primarily due to secondary recovery performance in Africa and in Gulf of Mexico fields in the United States. 
  In 2013, improved recovery increased reserves by 57 million barrels due to numerous small projects, including expansions of existing projects in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa. 
  In 2014, improved recovery increased reserves by 34 million barrels, primarily due to secondary recovery projects in the United States, mostly related to steamflood expansions in California.

Extensions and Discoveries   In 2012, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 101 million barrels in Other Americas, primarily due to the initial booking of the Hebron project in Canada. In the United States, additions at several Gulf of Mexico projects and drilling activities in the mid-continent region were primarily responsible for the 77 million barrel increase. 
  In 2013, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 55 million barrel increase in the United States. 
  In 2014, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico were primarily responsible for the 164 million barrel increase in the United States. 
  Purchases   In 2014, the purchase of additional reserves in Canada was responsible for the 26 million barrel increase in synthetic oil. 
  Sales   In 2014, the sale of the company s interests in Chad was responsible for the 20 million barrel decrease in Africa.

  Noteworthy changes in natural gas proved reserves for 2012 through 2014 are discussed below and shown in the table above: 
  Revisions   In 2012, net revisions of 1,007 BCF in Asia were primarily due to development drilling and additional compression in Bangladesh, and drilling results and improved field performance in Thailand. In Australia, updated reservoir data interpretation based on additional drilling at the Gorgon Project drove the 358 BCF increase. Drilling results from activities in the Marcellus Shale were responsible for the majority of the 318 BCF increase in the United States. 
  In 2013, net revisions of 627 BCF in Asia were primarily due to development drilling and improved field performance in Bangladesh and Thailand. In Australia, drilling performance drove the 229 BCF increase. The majority of the net decrease of 234 BCF in the United States was due to a change in development plans in the Appalachian region. 
  In 2014, net revisions of 775 BCF in Australia were primarily due to development drilling at Gorgon.  
  Extensions and Discoveries   In 2012, extensions and discoveries of 747 BCF in Australia were primarily due to positive drilling results at the Gorgon Project. 
  In 2013, extensions and discoveries of 951 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region. 
  In 2014, extensions and discoveries of 614 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region and the Delaware Basin.  
  Sales   In 2012, the sale of a portion of the company's equity interest in the Wheatstone Project was responsible for the 439 BCF reduction in Australia.

Table VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 
    
  The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations, and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent  management s estimate of the company s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption  Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows  refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.

  SUMMARY OF CHEVRON INCENTIVE PLAN AWARD CRITERIA    
    
  The Chevron Incentive Plan (CIP) is designed to recognize annual performance achievements. Annual operating and financial results figure prominently into this assessment, along with demonstrated progress on key business initiatives. Individual leadership is also recognized through this award. The award is delivered as an annual cash bonus based on a percentage of each participant s base salary. Participants include Chevron s named executive officers (NEOs).  The CIP award calculation is consistent for all CIP-eligible Chevron employees, with the award target varying by pay grade. The award is calculated as follows:  
    
                           Base Salary 
    X 
    CIP Award Target 
    X 
    Corporate Performance 
  Rating 
    X 
    Individual Performance Modifier 

CIP Award Target  . Before the beginning of each performance year, the Management Compensation Committee (MCC) establishes a CIP Award Target for each NEO, which is based on a percentage of the NEO s base salary.  The MCC sets target awards based on the median award of our Oil Industry Peer Group (Anadarko Petroleum, BP, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Exxon Mobil, Hess, Marathon Oil, Marathon Petroleum, Occidental Petroleum, Phillips 66, Royal Dutch Shell, Tesoro and Valero Energy).  All individuals in the same salary grade have the same target, which provides internal equity and consistency.   
    
  Corporate Performance Rating  . After the end of the performance year, the MCC sets the Corporate Performance Rating. This rating reflects the MCC s overall assessment of the Company s performance for that year, based on a range of measures used to evaluate performance against plan in four broad categories: financial; health, environment and safety; operating performance; milestones and commercial.  The MCC has discretion on weighting the categories and on weighting the measures within each category. Performance is viewed across multiple parameters (absolute results; results versus plan; results versus Oil Industry Peer Group and/or general industry; performance trends over time) and distinctions are made between the controllable and noncontrollable aspects of the measures. With these measures as the foundation, the MCC exercises its discretion in setting the Corporate Performance Rating. The minimum Corporate Performance Rating is zero and the maximum is 200 percent.   
    
  Individual Performance Modifier  . The MCC also takes into account individual performance. This is largely a personal leadership dimension, recognizing the individual effort and initiative expended and demonstrated progress on key business initiatives during the course of the year. The MCC uses its judgment in analyzing the individual performance of each NEO, his or her enterprise and business segment leadership, and how the business units reporting to the NEO performed.  Chevron s chief executive officer makes recommendations to the MCC as to the Individual Performance Modifier of each of our other NEOs.   
    
  Additional information concerning the CIP and annual CIP awards for each of Chevron s NEOs can be found in Chevron s annual Proxy Statement.

  DEFINITIONS OF SELECTED ENERGY TERMS 
    
  Barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE) 
  A unit of measure to quantify crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas amounts using the same basis. Natural gas volumes are converted to barrels on the basis of energy content. See   oil-equivalent gas   and   production  . 
    
  Development 
  Drilling, construction and related activities following discovery that are necessary to begin production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas. 
    
  Entitlement effects 
  The impact on Chevron s share of net production and net proved reserves due to changes in crude oil and natural gas prices, and spending levels, between periods.  Under PSCs and variable-royalty provisions of certain agreements, price and spend variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to the company.  For example, at higher prices, fewer volumes are required for Chevron to recover its costs under certain PSCs. Also under certain PSCs, Chevron's share of future profit oil and/or gas is reduced once specified contractual thresholds are met, such as a cumulative return on investment. 
    
  Exploration 
  Searching for crude oil and/or natural gas by utilizing geologic and topographical studies, geophysical and seismic surveys, and drilling of wells. 
    
  Gas-to-liquids     (GTL) 
  A process that converts natural gas into high-quality liquid transportation fuels and other products. 
    
  Liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
  Natural gas that is liquefied under extremely cold temperatures to facilitate storage or transportation in specially designed vessels. 
    
  Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) 
  Light gases, such as butane and propane, that can be maintained as liquids while under pressure. 
    
  Oil-equivalent gas (OEG) 
  The volume of natural gas needed to generate the equivalent amount of heat as a barrel of crude oil. Approximately 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of crude oil. 
    
  Oil sands 
  Naturally occurring mixture of bitumen   a heavy, viscous form of crude oil   water, sand and clay. Using hydroprocessing technology, bitumen can be refined to yield   synthetic oil. 
    
  Production 
  Total production   refers to all the crude oil (including synthetic oil), natural gas liquids and natural gas produced from a property.   Net production   is gross production minus both royalties paid to landowners and a government s agreed-upon share of production under a   production-sharing contract  .   Liquids   production refers to crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil volumes.   Oil-equivalent production   is the sum of the barrels of   liquids   and the oil-equivalent barrels of natural gas produced. See   barrels of oil-equivalent   and   oil-equivalent gas. 
    
  Production-sharing contract (PSC) 
  An agreement between a government and a contractor (generally an oil and gas company) whereby production is shared between the parties in a prearranged manner. The contractor typically incurs all exploration, development and production costs, which are subsequently recoverable out of an agreed-upon share of any future PSC production, referred to as cost recovery oil and/or gas. Any remaining production, referred to as profit oil and/or gas, is shared     between the parties on an agreed-upon basis as stipulated in the PSC. The government may also retain a share of PSC production as a royalty payment, and the contractor typically owes income tax on its portion of the profit oil or gas. The contractor s share of PSC oil and/or gas production and reserves varies over time, as     it is dependent on prices, costs and specific PSC terms.

Reserves 
  Crude oil or natural gas contained in underground rock formations called reservoirs and saleable hydrocarbons extracted from oil sands, shale, coalbeds or other nonrenewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas.   Net proved reserves   are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, and exclude royalties and interests owned by others. Estimates change as additional information becomes available.   Oil-equivalent reserves   are the sum of the liquids reserves and the oil-equivalent gas reserves. See   barrels of oil-equivalent   and   oil-equivalent gas.   The company discloses only net proved reserves in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
    
  Shale gas 
  Natural gas produced from shale rock formations where the gas was sourced from within the shale itself. Shale is very fine-grained rock, characterized by low porosity and extremely low permeability. Production of shale gas normally requires formation stimulation such as the use of hydraulic fracturing (pumping a fluid-sand mixture into the formation under high pressure) to help produce the gas. 
    
  Tight oil 
  Liquid hydrocarbons produced from shale (also referred to as shale oil) and other rock formations with extremely low permeability.  As with   shale gas  , production from tight oil reservoirs normally requires formation stimulation such as hydraulic fracturing. 
    
  Synthetic oil 
  A marketable and transportable hydrocarbon liquid, resembling crude oil, that is produced by upgrading highly viscous or solid hydrocarbons, such as extra-heavy crude oil or   oil sands  . 

DEFINITIONS OF SELECTED FINANCIAL TERMS 
    
  Earnings 
  The term   earnings   is net income attributable to Chevron Corporation as presented on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
    
  Return on capital employed (ROCE) 
  ROCE is calculated by dividing   earnings   (adjusted for after-tax interest expense and noncontrolling interests) by the average of total debt, noncontrolling interests and Chevron Corporation stockholders  equity for the year. 
    
  Return on stockholders  equity 
  Return on stockholders  equity is   earnings   divided by average Chevron Corporation stockholders  equity. Average Chevron Corporation stockholders  equity is computed by averaging the sum of the beginning-of-year and end-of-year balances.
