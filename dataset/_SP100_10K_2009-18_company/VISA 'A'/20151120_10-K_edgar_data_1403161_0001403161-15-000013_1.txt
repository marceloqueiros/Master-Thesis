   PART I 
    
    ITEM 1.    Business 
  General Business Developments 
  Visa Inc., which we refer to as Visa or the Company, is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We operate one of the world's most advanced processing networks      VisaNet       which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide. It also offers fraud protection for account holders and rapid payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa-branded cards and payment products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, our financial institution clients. 
  Visa Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 2007. In October 2007, we undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc., Visa International Service Association, Visa Canada Corporation and Inovant LLC became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Visa Europe Limited remains owned and governed by its European member financial institutions and is not a subsidiary of Visa Inc. Visa Inc. completed its initial public offering ("IPO") in March 2008. 
  General business developments in fiscal 2015 included the following: 

Product innovation  . Visa s fundamental approach to innovation focuses on: (i) supporting an evolving payments ecosystem; (ii) enhancing payment system security through innovation; and (iii) developing new platforms, products and services.  
              i. 
    Evolving payments ecosystem  .     By providing new and existing clients and partners greater access to Visa s network and payment capabilities, Visa is contributing to the evolving payments ecosystem. Through Visa's new developer center, financial institutions, software, cloud computing and other technology companies and new entrants will be able to more easily access Visa payment capabilities through programing interfaces and software developer kits beginning in 2016. The Visa Ready program also is intended to enable our partners to quickly deploy devices, software and services to consumers that meet Visa's standards, with a goal of significantly accelerating the pace of innovation in payments.  
              ii. 
    Enhancing payment system security through innovation  .     During 2015, Visa continued to make strides to enhance the security of the broader payments ecosystem with the following programs: 
              a. 
    Tokenization  : Tokenization replaces account numbers with digital tokens for online and mobile payments. This benefits merchants and our financial institution clients by removing sensitive account information from online and mobile payments and has the potential to reduce fraud risk. Visa has been working with several partners, including Apple, Google and Samsung, who are using our tokenization service to offer mobile payment solutions. 
              b. 
    EMV chip payment technology  : Visa is addressing fraud at the physical point-of-sale by working with merchants and our financial institution clients in the U.S. to introduce EMV-chip payment technology. 
              c. 
    Fraud and data analytics  : As an industry leader in payment security, we enhanced our real-time data analytics capabilities. When combined with Visa s centralized network structure, these capabilities help our financial institution clients and merchants identify and address fraud. 
       
           iii. 
    New platforms, products and services  . Visa continues to develop new platforms, products and services to benefit clients, merchants, consumers and other partners. 
              a. 
    Bangalore Technology Center:   We are investing in internal technology resources and have recently opened a new technology development center in Bangalore, India that will play a central role in the Company s efforts to accelerate digital commerce globally. The new technology center, a combination of office and collaboration space for more than 1,000 Visa developers, is Visa s largest outside the U.S.  
        5 

     Table of Contents  

            b. 
    Visa Checkout  : Visa Checkout is a fast, simple and intuitive payment experience that allows consumers to pay for goods online on a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop, in just a few clicks.     This service is presently available for eCommerce merchants and financial institutions in 16 countries around the world including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, and the U.S. 
              c. 
    Visa payWave  :     With Visa payWave technology, consumers are able to pay for products and services via smart phone or other devices, and by using their contactless cards at physical retailers. 
              d. 
    Visa Direct  :     Visa Direct provides a fast, secure and convenient solution for Visa s ecosystem of clients and partners. It enables customers to send and receive person-to-person payments and funds disbursements, and facilitates business to business settlements directly to eligible Visa account holders quickly and securely. 
              e. 
    mVisa:   In August 2015, Visa and several banks in India launched a pilot program testing mVisa, a mobile application, in India. The service extends the utility of existing Visa accounts by linking a consumer s Visa debit, credit or prepaid accounts to the mVisa mobile application that enables purchases in store, online and person-to-person through his or her mobile device  . 

U.S. Regulation  . Rules were implemented in the U.S. during 2011 and 2012 with respect to debit products under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), which regulates, among other things, debit interchange reimbursements rates, the availability of debit networks on a debit card and merchant transaction routing choice. The Federal Reserve's interpretation of the debit interchange provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act was upheld in March 2014 by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. After the Supreme Court declined to review the ruling, the Federal Reserve on August 10, 2015 confirmed its position on the sole remaining issue related to the interchange cost calculation, leaving the debit interchange rules in effect as originally adopted. See    Government Regulation    below. 

Fiscal 2015 developments in Russia  . In response to U.S. and EU sanctions targeting Russia's financial sector, the Russian government modified its National Payments Systems laws to require that all payment transactions in the Russian Federation be processed within the country. We agreed in February 2015 to transfer processing of Russian domestic transactions to the government-owned processor. Additionally, a new Russian law requiring all personal data of its citizens to be stored in Russia went into effect on September 1, 2015. Authorities have also indicated that Russia will issue a new national payment card called the "MIR" card. See   Government Regulation      Government-imposed market participation influences and restrictions      below. 
       
  On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into a transaction agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Visa Europe. Closing of the acquisition is subject to various conditions including regulatory approvals, and is expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. See   Note 2 Visa Europe     to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item     8   of this report. 
  Nature of Operations 
  Visa's mission is to accelerate the electronification of commerce. We operate an open-loop payments network, VisaNet, through which Visa connects and manages the exchange of information and value between: (i) issuers       financial institutions that issue Visa-branded cards or payment products to account holders, and (ii) acquirers       financial institutions that contract with merchants to accept Visa-branded cards or payment products. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. The issuers have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by the account holders. 
  Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our open-loop payments network. On purchase transactions, interchange reimbursement fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers. We generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees. In addition, we generally do not earn any revenue from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. The acquirers are typically responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. 
  A typical Visa transaction begins when the account holder presents his or her Visa-branded card or payment product to a merchant as payment for goods or services. The transaction information is then transmitted  
     6 

     Table of Contents  

   electronically to the acquirer and routed through VisaNet to the issuer for authorization. Following authorization, a clearing file containing the final transaction data is submitted from the acquirer and processed for final settlement between the issuer and acquirer. The following diagram illustrates the processing steps involved in a typical transaction on VisaNet. 

Our operating revenues are principally comprised of service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues, and are reduced by costs incurred under client incentive arrangements. The Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. 

Service revenues   consist of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Service revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services. 

Data processing revenues   consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are primarily generated from the number of transactions we process. 

International transaction revenues   consist of revenues earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. 

Client incentives   consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. 
     U.S. dollar settlements with our financial institution clients are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance. Settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to financial institution clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. 
     7 

     Table of Contents  

   In order to maintain the integrity of and minimize disruptions to our payments network, we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating regulations. The settlement indemnification applies to the amount of Visa payment transactions that have occurred, but have not yet settled. We maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on our consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in our name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. We have incurred no material loss related to settlement risk in recent years  . 
  Core Products and Services 
  Visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders: (i) pay now with debit; (ii) pay ahead with prepaid; or (iii) pay later with credit products. Visa also offers a growing suite of innovative digital, eCommerce, person-to-person payments and mobile products and services. These services facilitate transactions on our network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally. 
             
    Debit  . Our debit payment solutions support issuers' payment products that draw on demand deposit accounts, such as checking accounts. 

Prepaid.   Our prepaid payment solutions support issuers' payment products that access a pre-funded amount, allowing account holders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks. 

Credit.   Our credit payment solutions support issuers' deferred payment and customized financing products. 
     Our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions between our issuers and acquirers. VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture, enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and to provide value-added services, including information products, such as risk scoring and loyalty applications, while the transaction data is being routed through our network. 
  Visa's processing services continue to expand to address the needs of participants in the evolving payments ecosystem, through such offerings as our merchant gateway and Visa Debit Processing Services ("DPS"). Merchant gateway services provided through our CyberSource subsidiaries enable gateway routing and other services that make it easier for eCommerce merchants to accept, process and reconcile payments, manage fraud and safeguard payment security online. DPS provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating issuers of Visa debit, prepaid and ATM payment products. These and other services support our issuers and acquirers and their use of our products, and promote the growth and security of our payments network. 
  Processing Infrastructure 
  VisaNet consists of multiple synchronized processing centers, including two data centers in the U.S. that are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement among Visa Inc., Visa Europe Limited and others, Visa Europe's processing centers in the United Kingdom must maintain interoperability with Visa's synchronized system. Intelligent access points around the world complete the VisaNet global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institution clients worldwide to access our core processing and value-added services. 
  Visa also owns and manages additional data centers in the U.S. and internationally that enable transaction services and provide uninterrupted connectivity for account holders, our financial institution clients and our processing partners. 
  Intellectual Property 
  Our portfolio of trademarks, in particular our family of Visa marks, our PLUS mark and our Dove design mark, are important to our business. Through agreements with our issuers, we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. We own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, security systems and other matters. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology.

  We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014 accounted for more than 30% of our operating revenues in those years. 
  Working Capital 
  Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. 
  Concentration of Business and Financial Information About Geographic Areas 
  For more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information, see   Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data     Note 13 Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business   included elsewhere in this report. 
  Competition 
  We compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment. These include: 
             
    paper-based payments, principally cash and checks; 
                
    card-based payments, including credit, charge, debit, ATM, prepaid and private-label products; 
                
    eCommerce, mobile wallets and mobile payments; and 
                
    other electronic payments, including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automated clearing house ("ACH") and electronic data interchange. 
     Based on payments volume, total volume and number of transactions, Visa is the largest retail electronic payments network used throughout the world. The following chart compares our network with those of our major competitors for calendar year 2014: 

(1)   
    UnionPay, which operates primarily within the Chinese domestic market, is not included in this table because Visa currently does not compete in that market under local law. Although we are uncertain how UnionPay reports certain volumes, reportedly its numbers could approach or exceed some of those listed in this chart. 
               (2)   
    The data presented are provided by our financial institution clients. Previously submitted information may be updated and all data are subject to review by Visa. Visa Europe data are not included. 
               (3)   
    MasterCard, American Express, JCB, and Discover/Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1060 (March 2015). Includes all consumer and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some figures are estimates and currency figures are in U.S. dollars. MasterCard excludes Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express includes figures for third-party issuers. Discover figures consist of U.S. data only and include third-party issuers. JCB figures include third-party issuers and other payment-related products.     Certain general purpose payments network competitors are more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the U.S. Our competitors also have leading positions in certain countries. For example, UnionPay remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in China. 
     In the global debit network market segment, our Interlink and Visa Electron brands compete with Maestro, owned by MasterCard, and various regional and country-specific debit network brands, including STAR, NYCE and PULSE in the U.S., EFTPOS in Australia, NETS in Singapore and Interac in Canada. In addition to our PLUS brand, the primary cash access card brands are Cirrus, owned by MasterCard, and many of the debit network brands referenced above. In many countries, local debit brands provide the primary network, and our brands are used

     Table of Contents  

   primarily to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of our overall transaction volume. 
  The global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. We may face increasing competition from emerging players in the payment space, many of which are non-financial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional business model. The emergence of these potentially competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on eCommerce and/or mobile technologies. PayPal and Alipay are examples. These providers compete with us directly in some cases, yet may also be significant partners and customers of ours.    
  We also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients. We believe our fundamental value proposition of convenience, interoperability, accessibility and security offers us a key competitive advantage. We succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate. We do so by partnering with local financial institutions, merchants, governments, non-governmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions to meet their varied needs. We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively, due to our global brand, our broad set of Visa-branded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through VisaNet. 
  Employees 
  At September 30, 2015, we employed approximately 11,300 persons worldwide. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. 
   Government Regulation     
  Interchange reimbursement fees  . We have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the U.S. and many other geographies. During fiscal 2012, the Federal Reserve implemented new rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, setting a cap on the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for debit products issued by large financial institutions. These rules continue to have an adverse impact on our pricing, reduce the number and volume of U.S. debit transactions we process and decrease our associated revenues. See   Item 1A     Risk Factors      The Dodd-Frank Act and other regulations and developments arising from the Dodd-Frank Act may continue to harm our overall business    included elsewhere in this report. 
  Certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. also regulate or have the power to regulate debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia regulates interchange reimbursement rates and the governing authorities in India regulate the merchant discount rate  .   In May 2015, the EU published a regulation on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions, and interchange caps for intra-regional debit and credit card transactions will take effect on December 9, 2015. See   Item 1A     Risk Factors      Additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may reduce our transaction volumes and harm our overall business    and   Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data     Note 20 Legal Matters   included elsewhere in this report. 
  Network exclusivity and routing  . The Dodd-Frank Act limits the issuers' and our ability to impose rules for, or choose various forms of, network exclusivity and preferred routing in the U.S. debit and prepaid network market segments. Other jurisdictions have enacted similar limitations.  
  U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  . The Dodd-Frank Act created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues, including those pertaining to us to some extent. The CFPB s future actions may make payment card or product transactions generally less attractive to issuers, acquirers, consumers and merchants by further regulating disclosures, payment card practices, fees, routing and other matters with respect to credit, debit and prepaid cards. 
  No-surcharge rules  . We have historically implemented rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using their Visa-branded card or payment product instead of other means. As part of the settlement reached in the interchange multidistrict litigation, however, Visa has agreed to modify our rules to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances. See     Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data     Note 20 Legal Matters   included elsewhere in this report. A number of U.S. states as well as certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. have taken steps to prohibit surcharging. Following court challenges, some of these laws have been invalidated by federal courts in certain states and upheld in others.

   Data protection and information security  . Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions globally  .   In accordance with governing law, we devote substantial resources to maintain and continually refine our information security program in order to safeguard account holder information and under certain circumstances, to provide account holder notification in the event of a security breach. In addition, the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council periodically reviews aspects of our operations in the U.S. to examine our compliance with data integrity, security and operational requirements and standards, as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions. Regulators around the globe are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection due to the evolving nature and handling of data. The interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws around the globe are often uncertain and in a state of flux. 
  Anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctioned countries  . We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the PATRIOT Act. In addition, we are also subject to the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Controls ( OFAC ) that prohibit or restrict dealings with certain countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with specifically-designated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers, terrorists and terrorist organizations. We have policies, procedures, systems and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions. 
   Government-imposed market participation influences and restrictions   . Our market reach remains limited by certain governments' influence on their domestic payments competition and/or their protection of domestic issuers or payments network processors. Regulators in an increasing number of countries around the world have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries.  
  Regulation of Internet, mobile payment and other types of transactions.   Many jurisdictions have adopted or are considering regulations that require payments system participants, including our financial institution clients and us, to monitor, identify, filter, restrict or take other specific actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions. For example, U.S. federal legislation has been enacted that requires payment system operators to implement a system that allows issuers to identify Internet gambling transactions so they have the option to decline such transaction requests. State governments have been interested in the potential blocking of Internet interstate sales of cigarettes and alcohol, or the collection of state and local sales taxes on such Internet purchases. Implementing such systems increases costs for our financial institution clients and us, and may reduce merchant acceptance of Visa-branded cards and payment products for these purchases. 
  The U.S. Congress continues to consider regulatory initiatives in the areas of Internet prescription drug purchases, copyright and trademark infringement and privacy, among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on our financial institution clients and us. Some U.S. states are considering a variety of similar legislation. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including mobile payment transactions, money transfer, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients directly. These new requirements and developments may affect our financial institution clients' ability to offer existing products and services, extend credit via payment cards and products, and offer new types of payment programs, which could decrease our transaction volumes and revenues.

    ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  
  Regulatory Risks 
   Additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may reduce our transaction volumes and harm our overall business   . 
  We generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a purchase transaction as those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers. They are, however, a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees can substantially affect our revenues and overall payments volume.  
  We have historically set default interchange reimbursement rates in the U.S. and many other geographies. Interchange reimbursement rates, our operating rules and related practices have become subject to continued or increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these rates and practices.  
  When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. It may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems like competitors' closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. In addition, as a result of such regulations, we believe some issuers are charging new or higher fees to consumers. In certain instances, some acquirers elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants, regardless of the Visa interchange reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept Visa-branded cards or payment products or to steer account holders to alternate payment systems or forms of payment. In addition, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us and reductions in the fees that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs. For these reasons, additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may make Visa-branded cards and payment products less desirable, reduce our overall transaction volumes, and harm our overall business. 
   We are subject to regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network, or that deny them the option of selecting only our network   .  
  In order to provide account holders a consistent experience and transparency into VisaNet, we promote certain practices to ensure that Visa-branded cards are processed over our network. We have historically had agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the Visa network or receive incentives if they do so. In addition, certain issuers of some products have historically chosen to include only our network. We refer to these various practices as network exclusivity.  
  In addition, certain network or issuer rules or practices may be viewed as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks co-reside on Visa debit cards. For example, the Visa Rules require that all authorization, clearance and settlement of international transactions must be done through VisaNet. These are commonly referred to as routing rules. 
  The Dodd-Frank Act already limits our and issuers' ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area. Additional legislation or regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transactions we process. In order to retain transaction volume, we may reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers or increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers, acquirers or merchants. Any of these outcomes could harm our overall business. 
   The Dodd-Frank Act and other regulations and developments arising from the Dodd-Frank Act may continue to harm our overall business   .  
  As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate charged by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, with a possible fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction in the average system-wide fees previously charged. The Federal Reserve also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules  
     12 

     Table of Contents  

   also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. 
  These regulations have adversely affected our U.S. debit business and associated revenues by creating negative pressure on our pricing, reduced the volume and number of U.S. debit payments we process, and diminished associated revenues. Although we believe we have absorbed the principal impact of the October 2011 regulations, our business could continue to be affected, including if the Federal Reserve issues new or revised regulations. 
  Negative pressures have arisen through various channels. Other debit networks may become more aggressive in offering merchant cost reductions to win routing preference, which in turn puts more pressure on the business terms offered by Visa. A number of our clients obtained fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some clients elected to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa-affiliated networks or reduced the number of debit cards they issued and investments they made in marketing and rewards programs, while others imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships. Many merchants have used the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer account holders to other debit networks based on lower cost or other factors. Other clients and merchants are likely to take similar actions in the future. 
  Some elements of the Dodd-Frank Act lack definition and create the potential for networks to pursue different strategies subject to their interpretation of the rules. Our interpretation may result in a pursuit of strategies that may be less effective than those of our competitors. Overall, the regulations and developments arising from the Dodd-Frank Act could harm our overall business. 
  New laws or regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product offering may lead to new laws or regulations in other jurisdictions or of other product offerings  . 
  Regulators around the world increasingly note each other's approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another. The Dodd-Frank Act and the European Union interchange regulation are developments with such potential. See   Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item     8   of this report  .   Similarly, new laws and regulations involving one product offering may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to other product offerings. For example, regulations affecting debit payments could eventually spread to credit payments.  
  The risks created by a new law or regulation have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another region or in other product offerings. We may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing requirements, currency conversion, point of sale transaction rules and practices, privacy, and data use or protection.  As a result, the Visa Rules may differ from country to country or by product offering.  
  If widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services and fees, and other important aspects of our business in the various regions. In addition, adverse developments, regulations and litigation with respect to our industry or another industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation and result in greater regulatory and legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Any of these factors could harm our overall business. 
   Government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries   .  
  Governments in some countries provide resources to or protection for their domestic payment card networks, brands and processors. These governments may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic payments processing be done entirely in that country. In China, for example, UnionPay continues to enjoy advantages over international networks, remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark. Though the Chinese State Council has announced that international schemes, such as Visa, would be able to participate in the domestic market and be eligible to apply for a license to operate a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) in China, legislation and implementation guidelines for BCCI s have yet to be published and finalized. Meanwhile in Russia, National Payment Legislation has effectively prevented Visa from processing in the domestic market and has mandated that Visa migrate its domestic processing business to the state owned NSPK, which is the only entity allowed to process domestically. National laws that mandate domestic processing may increase our costs and decrease the number of Visa-branded cards issued or processed in those regions. These actions could impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our financial institution clients in those countries and substantially restrict our activities there and in  
     13 

     Table of Contents  

   other countries that may adopt similar practices. These actions could also force us to leave countries where we presently have activity and keep us from entering new markets. Although we are trying to effect change in these countries, we may not succeed. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, maintain or increase our revenues globally and extend our global brands.  
   We are subject to regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security   . 
  Privacy, data use and security continue to receive heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the U.S. and elsewhere. For example, in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach and those jurisdictions that have these laws are continuing to increase the circumstances and the breadth of these notices. These laws and regulations can impact the way we use and handle data, operate our products and services, and even impact our ability to offer a product or service. Our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands. These laws and regulations may increase Visa     s and our clients' costs, decrease the number of Visa-branded cards our clients issue and decrease our payments volume and revenue.  
   Evolving and increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us   . 
  Regulation of the payments industry has evolved and increased significantly. Examples include:  

Data protection and information security  .   Aspects of our operations and business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the U.S. and elsewhere. Our financial institution clients around the globe are subject to similar requirements under privacy laws and bank regulatory regimes. For example, as of September 1, 2015, Russia amended its personal data law to require personal  data operators  to store personal information of Russian citizens in databases located in Russia. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach.  

Regulatory and sanctions compliance  . We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC. An increase in the number of OFAC sanctions may affect the issuance, acceptance, reputation, and revenues associated with Visa-branded cards. Some of our clients located outside of the U.S. may not be subject to these same laws, regulations and sanctions, and, as a result, may initiate transactions that are permissible in their countries but that may not be permissible were the transaction to take place in the U.S.  

Regulation of the price of credit  . Many jurisdictions in which Visa-branded cards are used have regulations that could increase the costs of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of issuers to charge market-based interest rates and fees on credit card accounts. In the U.S., these include regulations issued under the Truth in Lending Act of 1968, as amended by the Credit CARD Act of 2009.    

Increased U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau scrutiny.   Regulatory changes by the CFPB that impose new requirements on or restrict the terms under which financial products can be offered could increase our clients      costs and decrease the number of Visa-branded payment cards our clients issue. The CFPB also has supervisory and independent examination authority as well as enforcement authority over certain financial institutions  ,   their service providers     and other entities  ,   which could include us due to our processing of credit, debit and prepaid transactions.  

Increased central bank oversight.   Several central banks and similar regulatory bodies around the world have increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry, and in some cases have already designated certain payment systems as "systemically important payment systems" or "critical infrastructure."  For example, Visa Europe was recently designated as systematically important by the Bank of England. Any such oversight may lead to additional regulations by central banks and other government regulators. These could include new settlement procedures, cyber security requirements or other policies or operational rules to address settlement and operational risks. Increased central bank oversight could also include new criteria for financial institution client participation and merchant or other non-bank access to our payments system. For example, in China, draft cyber security legislation may prevent companies like Visa from bringing international best practice standards for fraud and risk management when the market is open. 
       
     14 

     Table of Contents  

Safety and soundness regulation  . Banking regulations enacted in the U.S. and elsewhere may make some financial institutions less likely to become an issuer of Visa-branded cards because they may be subject to increased risk management or higher capital requirements.  

Regulation of Internet and mobile transactions  . Legislation in various jurisdictions may make it less desirable or more costly to complete Internet transactions using Visa-branded cards by affecting the legality of those transactions, the laws that govern the transactions, their taxation or the allocation of various intellectual property rights. In addition, new mobile regulatory requirements could impact our business practices, for instance in China where new regulation may prevent companies like Visa from introducing new technologies when the market opens to them. 

Money transfer regulations.   As we expand our product offerings, we may become subject to U.S. federal and state money transfer regulations, international payments laws and other existing, new or evolving regulations which could increase our regulatory oversight and compliance costs. 
     Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities. Our programs and policies are designed to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-corruption and sanctions regulations and other laws, and we continue to enhance them. But, as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase, we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal money penalties, litigation and damage to our global brand reputation. The impact of such regulations on our clients and on us may increase compliance costs and reduce the volume of payments we process. Moreover, such regulations can limit the types of products and services that we offer, the countries in which Visa-branded cards are used and the types of account holders and merchants who can obtain or accept Visa-branded cards, thereby harming our overall business. 
  Litigation Risks  
   Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments   .  
  Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation, which is described in   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities   to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item     8   of this report. The U.S. retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the U.S. covered litigation. These include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our IPO and any subsequent offerings of our shares of class A common stock (or deposits of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offerings). They also include a loss sharing agreement, a judgment sharing agreement and an omnibus agreement, as amended. In addition, our U.S. financial institution clients are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to Visa U.S.A. Inc.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. These mechanisms are unique, complicated and tiered, and if we cannot use one or more of them, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent. 
  The principal remaining U.S. covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement rates. See   Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item     8   of this report  .   Beginning in 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed on behalf of merchants against us, MasterCard and/or other defendants, including certain Visa member financial institutions. We refer to this as the interchange multidistrict litigation or MDL 1720. Among other allegations, the plaintiffs alleged that Visa's setting of default interchange reimbursement rates violated federal antitrust laws and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. The lawsuits were transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. 
  The plaintiffs in MDL 1720 seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount rates as well as injunctive and other relief. The consolidated class action complaint alleges that estimated damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars. Because these lawsuits were brought under the U.S. federal antitrust laws, any actual damages would be trebled.  
  The allocation of any monetary judgment or certain settlements among the defendants is governed by an omnibus agreement dated February 7, 2011, and amended August 26, 2014 and October 22, 2015. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities   to our consolidated financial statements  
     15 

     Table of Contents  

   included in   Item     8   of this report. Visa's portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement, as amended, would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan.  
  We signed settlement agreements in connection with MDL 1720, which included an agreement to pay approximately $4.0 billion to the class plaintiffs. On January 14, 2014, the court entered a final judgment order approving the settlement, from which a number of objectors have appealed. Until the appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that we will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement.  
  A number of merchants have filed opt-out cases in various federal district courts. All of the cases filed in federal court have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, or have been transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. The court has entered an order confirming that MDL 1720 includes: (i) all current and future actions transferred to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceedings; and (ii) all actions filed in the Eastern District of New York that arise out of operative facts as alleged in the cases subject to the transfer orders of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Cases that are transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720 or that are brought after October 22, 2015, by an opt out of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 and arise out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 are U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  .  
    
  Failure of our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan to insulate us adequately from the impact of such settlements or judgments could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. Such a failure could even cause us to become insolvent. The U.S. retrospective responsibility plan addresses only the U.S. covered litigation. The plan generally does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future, except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our IPO that are transferred to or otherwise included in the interchange multidistrict litigation or that are brought by a Rule 23(b)(3) opt out and arise out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720. In addition, non-monetary settlement terms and judgments in the U.S. covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business. Therefore, even if our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our obligations with respect to monetary liabilities from settlements of, and judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation, it will not insulate us from the monetary impact of pending or future litigation. 
    
  As described in   Note 2 Visa Europe     and     Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities     to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item     8   of this report, on November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into a transaction agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Visa Europe. The closing is subject to various conditions including regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Visa Inc., Visa Europe or their affiliates are, or may become, a party to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. As part of the acquisition terms, the Company has obtained certain protection in respect of losses resulting from such existing and potential litigation through the preferred stock and the U.K. loss sharing agreement. If claims are not covered by these transactional protections, Visa Europe may have recourse under its membership documents against members under the terms of the existing indemnity arrangements (other than in respect of certain claims relating to U.K. domestic multilateral interchange fees). However, similar to the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, failure of these protections to insulate us adequately from the impact of settlements or judgments in the existing and potential litigation against Visa Inc., Visa Europe or their affiliates could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. 
  If we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits, we may have to pay substantial damages  .  
  Like many other large companies, we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competition or antitrust law, consumer protection law or intellectual property law, among others. Examples of such claims are described more fully in   Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item     8   of this report. Some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages; therefore, we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate our liability. Accordingly, we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings. 
  Particularly in cases involving merchants and consumers, private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us due to the size and scope of our business. If we are unsuccessful in our defense against a large class action lawsuit, such as the U.S. or Canadian merchant class action lawsuits, monetary damages could be  
     16

   significant, which could harm our financial condition. See   Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item     8   of this report. 
   There may be limitations on our business or changes to our business practices resulting from our litigation   .  
  Certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation. We may also have to change our business practices in response to pending or future litigation. For example, under the settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation, we have agreed, among other things, to permit merchants to add surcharges to credit transactions in certain circumstances. See     Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data     Note 20 Legal Matters   included elsewhere in this report. Additional surcharges to credit transactions could adversely impact consumers' usage of Visa-branded payment products.  
  Settlements of, or judgments in pending and future litigation could force us to limit the rates we set, revise our rules about rates charged to consumers who use Visa-branded payment products or make other modifications that could harm our overall business. 
   We may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in the tax laws   . 
  We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may decrease their accuracy. We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. Relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material, adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws, such as recent proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform, may also increase our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also   Note 19 Income Taxes   to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item     8   of this report. 
   We have limited rights to enforce our Framework Agreement with Visa Europe, which could expose us to significant liabilities   .  
  While we have entered into an agreement to acquire Visa Europe, until the transaction closes or if it fails to close, our relationship  is governed by the Framework Agreement. In the event Visa Europe fails to meet its obligations under the Framework Agreement, our remedies are limited. We are unable to terminate the Framework Agreement even upon Visa Europe's material, uncured breach. See   Note 2 Visa Europe   to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item     8   of this report.  
  Under the Framework Agreement, we may be required to indemnify Visa Europe for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their actions relating to the payments business. This obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents engaged in the actions gives rise to such claims. The indemnity obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control. Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities. 
  In our view, pursuant to the Framework Agreement, Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. and Visa International Service Association ("Visa International") in connection with the European Competition Proceedings (i.e., the pending European Commission investigation and the filed or unfiled claims in the U.K. Merchant Litigation), including payment of any fines or damages that may be imposed. However, Visa Europe has informed us of its view that it is not obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. or Visa International for these claims. If Visa Europe continues in its refusal to indemnify us and we cannot enforce the indemnity, we could be exposed to significant liabilities which would not be covered under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See   Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item 8   of this report. 
  Business Risks  
   We face intense pressures on client pricing   . 
  Pressure on client pricing poses challenges for our business. In order to stay competitive, we offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments and expand their Visa-branded card base. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing and other support payments. We have continued to increase the use of incentives such as up-front cash payments and fee discounts in many countries, including the U.S. In addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to  
     17 

     Table of Contents  

   win routing preference in situations where our products co-reside with other networks and merchants have a choice of network routing options. The economic pressures on our clients arising from the Dodd-Frank Act have also increased our use of incentives. As a result, the provision of certain products and services may be less profitable or become unprofitable, which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits. 
  If we continue to increase incentives to our clients, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume, increasing the amount of fee-based services we provide or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. In addition, we benefit from long-term contracts with certain clients, including those that are large contributors to our revenue. Continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from maintaining such agreements in the future on the same or favorable terms. We may also have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations. While we may implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives, we may not be successful in our efforts or they may not offset the decreases in our revenues.  
   We face intense competition in our industry   .  
  The global payments industry is intensely competitive and, as a result, our payment programs compete against all forms of payment. These include cash, checks, electronic, eCommerce, virtual currencies and mobile payments, as well as traditional general purpose card networks. In addition, our open-loop payments network competes against other alternate payment systems such as closed-loop payment systems. Traditional or nontraditional competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage by leveraging services or products in areas in which we do not directly compete to win business in areas where we do compete.  
  Our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. The Dodd-Frank Act increased this competitive pressure. The risk to maintaining or securing our clients' long-term commitments to our products increased with the Dodd-Frank Act's restrictions on network exclusivity in the debit sector. We do not have exclusivity with our largest clients such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. In certain circumstances, our clients may terminate these relationships on relatively short notice without significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. See   Note 13 Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business   to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item 8   of this report. 
  Additionally, some of our competitors may develop substantially better technology or have greater financial resources. They may offer a wider range of programs, products and services than we do, including more innovative ones. They may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours, achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance. They may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements.  
  Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments. They may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory, technological and other developments. In many cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions. 
  We expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future. For example: 

competitors, clients and others may develop products that compete with, impair or replace the value-added services we provide to support our transaction processing; 

parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position in the payments value chain; 

we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services for use by our customers, processors or other third parties; 

participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services;  
       
     18 

     Table of Contents  

competition may increase from alternate types of payment services, such as mobile payment services, eCommerce payment services and services that permit direct debit of consumer checking accounts or ACH payments;  

new players and intermediaries in the payments value chain may redirect transactions or steer account holders away from our network; or 

new services and technologies that we develop may be impacted by industry-wide solutions and standards set by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute, as well as EMVCo, related to EMV-chip payment technology, cloud-based payments, tokenization or other technologies. 
     Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth. 
  Disintermediation from the payments value chain could harm our business  .  
  Our position in the payments value chain is key to our business. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks, virtual currencies and certain alternate payments systems, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without any intermediaries. These competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model. Regulatory actions or initiatives such as the Dodd-Frank Act or the Federal Reserve s Faster Payments efforts     may provide them with increased opportunity to do so. In addition, although other competitors are pursuing similar lines of business or adopting similar commercial models, they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multi-party payments systems such as ours. 
  We also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies including mobile payments, and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing payments. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers. 
   Additional consolidation in the financial services industry could impact our revenues and harm our overall business   .  
  Additional consolidation in the financial services industry or the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors may reduce the overall number of our clients. This could result in the acquired financial institution's Visa business shifting to a competitor, resulting in a substantial loss of business to us.  
  Our existing clients may seek to obtain more favorable pricing agreements. We may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume-based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses. Pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could impact our revenues and harm our overall business. 
   Merchants' continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance exposes us to additional risks   .  
  We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of Visa-branded payment cards. Consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry. Some merchants have sought to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by filing lawsuits. If they continue, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses.  
  Additionally, some merchants have pushed for changes to the Visa Rules which govern Visa acceptance at the point of sale, including the ability to accept only certain types of Visa-branded cards (e.g., credit or debit) and impose account holder surcharges. If successful, where applicable, these efforts could adversely impact consumers' usage of Visa-branded payment products. 
  We also face competitive pressures on pricing. We and our clients negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of Visa-branded payment cards. If merchants continue to consolidate, we and our clients may have to increase the incentives provided to certain large merchants. Some merchants also continue to invest in their own payment solutions, using both  
     19 

     Table of Contents  

   traditional and new technology platforms.     Examples include closed-loop payment systems     that are specific to a single merchant     or multi-merchant solutions like the Merchant Customer Exchange, which is designed for a mobile platform utilizing alternative payment systems and has many merchant participants.     Such programs may offer unique or specialized benefits to consumers, including discounts or customized offers.     If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could harm our business. 
   We may not be able to grow or maintain our business due to certain financial institutions or merchants' exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors   .  
  Certain financial institutions or merchants have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue or accept payment cards. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them. In addition, these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and prevent us from growing our business.  
   Our success depends on our relationships with our financial institution clients, acquirers, merchants, account holders and other third parties   . 
  We depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support and to compete effectively for our programs and services. We do not issue cards, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders using cards that carry our brands. Each issuer determines these competitive card features for their customers. Account holders, however, may associate these features with our brands and if they are dissatisfied, our business may be harmed.  
  As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act's network exclusivity regulations, we have engaged and will continue to engage in significantly more discussions with merchants, acquirers and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth. We already engage in many co-branding efforts, in which we contract with merchants, who directly receive incentives from us. As these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. 
  Outside the U.S., some governments only permit local providers to complete domestic processing, which prohibits us from overseeing the end-to-end processing of the transactions. Therefore, we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or other third party processors in these regions to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving Visa-branded cards. Our inability to oversee the end-to-end processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands.  
  In addition, we depend on third parties and our financial institution clients to provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf, and to the extent that such third-party vendors or our financial institution clients fail to perform or deliver adequate services, our business and reputation could be impaired.  
   Negative perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation   .  
  Our brands and reputation are key assets of our business. The ability to attract and retain account holders and financial institution clients to Visa-branded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry's quality of service, use and protection of account holder data, regulatory compliance, financial condition, corporate responsibility and other factors. Negative perception or publicity, particularly in light of the rapid, widespread use of social media channels, could cause damage to our brands and reputation. Our business may also be affected by actions taken by our clients or other third parties, or by circumstances that are outside of our control:  
             
    Our clients and other third parties may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands or that are inconsistent with our own business practices.  

Until we are able to complete the proposed acquisition of Visa Europe, our limited control over the quality of service and promotion of our brands in Europe could affect our brands and reputation globally. While Visa Europe has very broad latitude to use our brands and technology within its region, Visa Europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money conducting research on brand performance, promoting or maintaining the strength of our brands. 
       
     20 

     Table of Contents  

Any negative perception of the U.S. arising from its political, economic, social or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brands globally by associating Visa with those positions.  
     Any of these factors could turn clients and consumers away from our brand and products, require us to take on additional liabilities and costs, result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny, and harm our overall business.  
   We may continue to be affected by economic events in financial markets around the world   .  
  The current threats to global economic growth include geopolitical instability in Brazil, Venezuela, Russia, Ukraine, the Middle East and other oil producing countries, which could affect oil prices, economic fragility in the Eurozone and in the U.S., higher interest rates hurting the housing market, sluggish job creation, political discord, spending cuts and debt defaults. While there continues to be some improvements in advanced economies, emerging economies continue to suffer with slower growth. Consumer spending continues to be impacted from consumer debt levels, elevated housing inventory, deflation, changes in savings rates, continued equity market volatility, decreased export activity, lowered government spending and additional government intervention. Furthermore, continued challenges in the credit environment, bank instability, downgrades of sovereign, bank and commercial debt, political issues affecting the handling of national debt, and the uncertainty arising from new government policies could also impact our clients, merchants and account holders.  
  The fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments or crises were to arise around the world. These include defaults on government debt, exhaustion of national economic stimulus packages, significant increases in oil prices, tax increases, a significant decline in the commercial real estate market and policy missteps. Most recently, the economic situations in various countries in Europe have been particularly unstable, arising from the real prospect of debt defaults. If such defaults occur, or if the measures taken to avert such defaults create their own instability, economic turmoil is likely to result, and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant.  
  The volatility of the current economic environment in advanced and emerging economies and the responses by financial institutions and governments may create new risks or increase the impact of existing ones. These include the following:  
             
    Depressed consumer and business confidence may continue to decrease account holder spending.  

Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients' businesses may reduce the accuracy of our estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets.  

Our clients may implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing budgets or increase requests for greater incentives or reduced fees from us.  

Our clients may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services, which could reduce account holders' desire to use these products.  

Our clients may increase account holder fees as a cost-recovery initiative, or as a result of regulatory action, decreasing their value proposition to consumers and reducing consumers' desire to use our products. 

Government intervention or investments in our clients may negatively affect our business in those regions with our financial institution clients.  

Tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility. 

The U.S. government's inability to meet its obligations or a possible further downgrade in the U.S. debt rating could adversely affect the liquidity of our investments, a substantial portion of which are in U.S. treasury and government securities. 

Our clients may default on their settlement obligations, including for reasons unrelated to payment card activity, such as mortgage loan commitments.  

Adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the dollar value of our revenues and payments in foreign currencies.  
        21 

     Table of Contents  

The current economic environment could lead some clients to curtail or postpone near-term investments in growing their card portfolios, limit credit lines, modify fees and loyalty programs, or take other actions that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these clients.  

Declines in stock prices or significant instability in the securities markets worldwide could cause consumer spending to decline materially.  
     Any of these developments could harm our overall business.  
   A decline in non-U.S. and cross-border activity and in multi-currency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability   .  
             
    We generate a significant amount of our revenues from cross-border transactions, and our clients pay us fees in connection with them. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. Some of these cross-border transaction fees vary depending on the transaction currency and whether the transaction currency is different than the account holder's billing currency as provided to Visa by his or her issuer. Additionally, adverse changes in exchange rates could reduce the number of cross-border transactions which may harm our revenues.  
                
    In addition, Visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activities that result when our clients settle transactions in different currencies. A reduction in multi-currency transactions may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activities and adversely affect our revenues. Limitations or changes in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rates for multi-currency transactions as a result of regulation, changes to tax policy, litigation, competitive pressures, reduced volatility in currency markets or other reasons may also adversely affect our revenues. 

Cross-border travel may be adversely affected by global geopolitical, economic, social and other conditions. These include the threat of terrorism, social or political instability, natural disasters, effects of climate change and outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases. The need for conversion of currencies declines as cross-border travel is impacted.  

Moreover, if our financial institution clients decide to change practices (e.g., prohibit certain transactions or increase account holder fees associated with cross-border transactions), there could be a decline in account holder spending because the value proposition to the consumer could be reduced. 
     Transactions outside the U.S. represent an increasingly important part of our strategy, which we hope will continue to grow. However, a decline in non-U.S. and cross-border activity and multi-currency transactions would decrease the number of cross-border transactions we process and our revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected as a consequence.  
  We risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations for which we have provided indemnifications  .  
  We indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. While the amount of our indemnification obligations has no limit, our exposure under the indemnification is restricted to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. 
  Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day could cause us to exceed our available financial resources and impact our liquidity. Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses, and harm our business. See   Note 11 Settlement Guarantee Management   to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item     8   of this report.  
  Some of our clients are considered group members under the Visa Rules. As a result, some of these group members have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent  
     22 

     Table of Contents  

   financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy. To the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy, we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure, which could impact our liquidity.  
   The use of our products and our revenues could decline if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services or comply with new laws and regulations   .  
  Rapid, significant technological changes continue to confront the payments industry. These include developments in mobile and other proximity payment and acceptance, eCommerce, tokenization, crypto-currency and blockchain technologies. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we work closely with third parties, including some potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, resistance to change from clients or merchants, or third parties' intellectual property rights. If we are unable to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards, it could reduce the use of our products and harm our business. 
   The perception of our brands and our business could be harmed if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or compromised   .  
  Processing or other technology malfunctions, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in long-distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorism, effects of climate change or other catastrophic events may disrupt or compromise our transaction processing systems. In addition, we may be susceptible to physical or computer-based attacks by terrorists or hackers due to our role in the global payments industry. These concerns about security are increased when information is transmitted over the Internet and new technologies are used to conduct financial transactions. Threats include cyberattacks such as computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial-of-service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. Any of these incidents could result in a degradation or disruption of our services or damage to our properties, equipment and data. They could also compromise data security. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded.     Finally, potential and actual attacks could also result in increased costs, both for recovery and for prevention against future attacks. 
  Additionally, we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require for similar reasons, the failure could interrupt our services. Because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands' reliability and harm our business.  
   We may encounter account data breaches, cyberattacks or system failures involving card or other data processed, stored or transmitted by third parties or by us   .  
  We, our clients, merchants, and other service providers process, store or transmit account holder and other information in connection with Visa-branded cards and payment products. In addition, our clients may use third-party processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands. The security measures and procedures we, our clients, merchants and other service providers have in place to protect sensitive account holder data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches, cyberattacks or system failures  .   Defending against even unsuccessful attempts to access our systems could materially increase our costs. 
  A failure or breach of the systems processing, storing or transmitting sensitive account holder data and other information could lead to fraudulent activity involving Visa-branded cards, reputational damage, claims against us, and loss of clients. If we are sued in any lawsuit in connection with any data security breach, we could be involved in protracted litigation. If unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits, we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure, any of which could harm our business. In addition, any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach, cyberattacks or system failure at one or more of our clients, merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of Visa-branded cards, which could harm our payments volume, revenues and future growth prospects. Finally, a breach may also subject Visa to additional regulations or  
     23 

     Table of Contents  

   governmental or regulatory investigations, which could result in significant compliance costs, fines or enforcement actions against the Company or potential restrictions imposed by regulators on our ability to process transactions.  
   Fraudulent or other illegal activity involving Visa-branded cards or payment products could harm our business   .  
  Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture account holder and other information. They use this information to conduct fraudulent transactions involving our payment products. Outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing. As a result, more third parties are involved in processing transactions using Visa-branded cards or payment products. A rise in fraud levels and other illegal activities involving Visa-branded cards or payment products could lead to reputational damage to our brands. This could reduce the use and acceptance of Visa-branded cards and payment products, or lead to greater regulation, which could increase our compliance costs, lower our payments volume and harm our overall business.  
    
  Failure to maintain interoperability with Visa Europe's systems could damage the business and global perception of the Visa brands  .  
  Until our proposed acquisition of Visa Europe closes and for a period of time afterwards while Visa Europe's systems are being integrated with Visa's systems, Visa and Visa Europe will continue to maintain mostly separate authorization, clearing and settlement systems. As a result, we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories, regardless of where it originates. Visa Europe's independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to increasing costs and difficulty in maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems. Any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products between Visa Europe and us could negatively affect account holders from Visa Europe using payment products in the countries we serve or our account holders using payment products in Visa Europe's region. Failure to authorize, clear and settle inter-territory transactions quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brands.  
  Structural and Organizational Risks  
   We may experience added costs and challenges in operating our business in certain territories due to our relationship with Visa Europe   .  
  Until our proposed acquisition of Visa Europe closes, Visa Europe's exclusive license of our trademarks and technologies under the Framework Agreement gives us little ability to control and oversee Visa Europe's operations in its region. If we want to change a global rule or to implement certain changes that may be viewed as unfavorable to Visa Europe and its members, Visa Europe is not required to implement the changes unless we agree to pay for the associated implementation costs. This may result in added costs and expenses to our business. Furthermore, the licenses granted under the Framework Agreement may raise licensing, payment and associated tax treatment concerns. 
  Until our proposed acquisition of Visa Europe closes, Visa Europe may hinder our ability to acquire new businesses or to operate them effectively in its region. If the acquired business has operations in Visa Europe's region, Visa Europe may play a significant part in influencing our ongoing operational decisions and costs there. Finally, Visa Europe may undertake operational and litigation strategies, including, but not limited to, our ongoing litigation in the U.K. and our ongoing case with the European Commission, that may adversely impact our business and reputation globally. 
   We may be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the increasingly global, dynamic, competitive, economic and regulatory environment   .  
  For us to remain organizationally effective, we must effectively empower and deploy our management and operational resources, and incorporate both global and local perspectives into our decisions and processes. If we fail to do so, we may be unable to expand quickly, and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory.  
  In addition, if we are unable to make decisions quickly, assess our opportunities and risks, execute our strategy and implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes, as needed, we may not be successful in this increasingly global, dynamic, competitive, economic and regulatory environment.

   We may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees  .  
  Our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could adversely affect our business and our future success.  
   Future sales of our class A common stock, or the end of transfer restrictions on our class B common stock, could result in dilution to holders of our existing class A common stock   .  
  The market price of our class A common stock could fall as a result of many factors. Under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, upon final resolution of our U.S. covered litigation, all class B common stock will become convertible into class A common stock. Future offerings of our class A common stock or the end of the transfer restrictions on our class B common stock would increase the number of class A common stock outstanding, which could adversely affect the market price and dilute the voting power of our existing class     A common stock. Likewise, if we complete the proposed acquisition of Visa Europe and issue the preferred shares, similar impacts on market price and dilution to our existing Class A common stock could occur upon conversion of the preferred shares into Class A common shares. The market price of our class     A common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase in the number of class A common stock outstanding could occur in the future.  
   If funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the value of our class A common stock will be diluted   .  
  Under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all U.S. covered litigation will be released back to us. At that time, each share of class     B common stock will become convertible into shares of class A common stock, benefiting the holders of class     B common stock. This in turn will result in dilution of the interest of holders of class     A common stock. The amount of funds released and the market price of our class A common stock will determine the extent of the dilution.  
   Holders of our class B and C common stock may have different interests than our holders of our class A common stock concerning certain significant transactions   .  
  Although their voting rights are limited, holders of our class B and C common stock can vote on certain significant transactions. These include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under Delaware law. The holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with holders of class A common stock. Likewise, if we complete the proposed acquisition of Visa Europe and issue the preferred shares, a similar dynamic may occur with the holders of the preferred shares. 
  Anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or a change in control  .  
  Provisions contained in our current certificate of incorporation, in our current bylaws and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable. For instance, except for limited exceptions, no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance. In addition, except for common stock previously issued in connection with our reorganization to Visa Members, as defined in our current certificate of incorporation, no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis.  
   We may not be able to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future   .  
  Since August 2008, we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class A, B and C common stock. The payment of dividends, if any, is subject to the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. If, as a result of these factors, we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may not be able to pay dividends to all of our stockholders. Specifically, if a dividend is declared or paid, an equivalent amount must be paid on each class or series of our common stock (and on the preferred shares we are obligated to issue if we complete our proposed acquisition of Visa Europe).

    Acquisitions, strategic investments and entries into new businesses could disrupt our business   .  
  Although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to successfully finance, partner with or integrate them. Such transactions, including our anticipated acquisition of Visa Europe, would present significant challenges and risks. In cases where strategic acquisitions or investments are not successfully implemented or completed, our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively impacted. We may incur substantial debt for strategic acquisitions or investments, which could adversely impact our credit ratings  .   Achieving the benefits of an acquisition is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business and systems into our existing operations, successfully managing new risks associated with the acquired business and achieving expected synergies, any of which we may be unable to achieve on a timely basis or at all. 
  Until our acquisition of Visa Europe is completed, we are subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to Visa Europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in Visa Europe's territory, which impacts our ability to expand or conduct business in those regions. Regulatory constraints, particularly competition regulations, may also affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of our acquisitions or investments. Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges or increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and the risks of complying with foreign regulations. 
  Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition or investment will take time and resources from our core business and may disrupt our operations. We may spend time and money on acquisitions or investments that do not increase our revenues. Although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses, products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we cannot guarantee that they will be successful.  
  With the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments, we may choose to participate in areas in which we have not engaged in the past, either through acquisitions or through organic development. These include digital, eCommerce, loyalty services and mobile payments. Our recent entry into these businesses requires additional resources and presents an additional degree of risk, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Risks Relating to our Proposed Acquisition of Visa Europe 
    
   We may not be able to complete the acquisition of Visa Europe on the terms currently contemplated or at all   .  
  On November 2, 2015, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Visa Europe Ltd. We and Visa Europe have agreed to use all reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to complete the acquisition. There is no assurance, however, that the acquisition will ultimately be completed, as the obligations of the parties to complete the acquisition are subject to various conditions. These conditions include, among others: 
             
    receipt of necessary regulatory approvals;  

absence of any material adverse effect (as determined under the definitive transaction documentation) on Visa Europe or the Company since September 30, 2014; 

absence of legal restraints that prohibit the closing of the acquisition; 

the U.K. loss sharing agreement remaining in full force and effect and the litigation management deed having been fully executed and remaining in full force and effect; 

compliance by each party in all material respects with its obligations under the acquisition agreement; and 

Visa Europe holding the full power and authority to effect the transaction. 
       
  The acquisition agreement may be terminated by us or Visa Europe, subject to specified exceptions, if the acquisition is not completed by August 2, 2016, or if legal restraints that prohibit the closing have become final and non-appealable. 
     26 

     Table of Contents  

   If we fail to complete the acquisition, Visa Europe would continue to have the right to require us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from Visa Europe s members under the terms of the put option (as it existed prior to its amendment in connection with the proposed acquisition). Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. We may not have the resources to fund the purchase price, particularly if the reason we failed to complete the acquisition was due to our inability to raise debt financing. 
   Financing the acquisition of Visa Europe exposes us to risk   . 
  To finance the Visa Europe acquisition, we expect to issue senior unsecured debt in an amount ranging between $15 and $16 billion in the first half of fiscal 2016, with maturities ranging between two and 30 years depending on market conditions. We cannot predict whether we will be able to issue this debt on favorable terms, in this timeframe, or at all. If we are unable to issue this debt on favorable terms, the cost to us of financing the acquisition may be higher than we currently expect. 
  Moreover, although we currently anticipate that the issuance of this debt will not adversely impact our credit ratings, there can be no assurance that one or more credit rating agencies will not lower our credit ratings, particularly if there is a perceived deterioration in our business or financial prospects. Any lowering of our credit ratings before or in connection with the issuance of this debt would be expected to increase the cost of financing the acquisition.  
  If we are unable to issue this debt and are not able to obtain alternative financing on terms that are acceptable to us, we may be unable to complete the acquisition, which could expose us to liability to Visa Europe and its shareholders. 
  If we issue this debt but then fail to complete the acquisition, we will nevertheless incur interest expense, which may be higher than any returns we are able to achieve through investing the proceeds, in our business or otherwise. In addition, we may be obliged to redeem this debt at a redemption price that exceeds the net proceeds to us from its initial issuance. 
   We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Visa Europe acquisition   . 
    
  Even if we complete the Visa Europe acquisition, a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits to us from the acquisition. For example: 
             
    the process of integrating Visa Europe s operations into ours may be more difficult and/or may require more resources than we anticipate; 

we may assume unexpected liabilities; 

we may face an increased risk of customer loss, for example if our European bank customers that were previously members of Visa Europe choose to expand business relationships with our competitors or otherwise support or engage in competing card or other payment solutions;  

there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties, commercial issues or conditions, and expenditures; 

we would become subject to EU and other regulations that govern the operations of Visa Europe, including new regulations governing the separation of scheme and processing that have not yet been fully defined, as well as any ongoing or future litigation involving Visa Europe; 

we may fail to retain key personnel of Visa Europe; 

the transaction may divert the time and resources of our senior management and disrupt our current operations to a greater degree than we currently contemplate; 

we may not be able to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock in amounts sufficient to offset the dilution resulting from the preferred stock that we intend to issue as part of the acquisition consideration; and 
        27 

     Table of Contents  

we may incur higher costs to finance the transaction than we currently contemplate. 
       
  If we do not successfully implement the Visa Europe acquisition or the acquisition is not completed on the terms we currently contemplate, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be negatively impacted. In particular, although we currently expect the Visa Europe acquisition to be mildly accretive to adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year 2017 (before one-time integration costs), if the expenses associated with integrating Visa Europe into our operations and financing the acquisition are higher than we currently contemplate, if we fail to achieve our revenue expectations due to unexpected customer losses or otherwise, or if we do not achieve the benefits we anticipate from revenue synergies, cost savings, and increased repurchases of Class A common stock, we may not achieve this goal.

    Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
     All per share amounts and number of shares presented below reflect the four-for-one stock split that was effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. See   Note 14 Stockholders' Equity   in   Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   of this report.  
  Price Range of Common Stock 
  Our class A common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  V  since March 19, 2008. At   November 13, 2015  , we had 352 stockholders of record of our class A common stock. The number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders, because a large portion of our class A common stock is held in "street name" by banks and brokers. The following table sets forth the intra-day high and low sale prices for our class A common stock in each of our last eight fiscal quarters:    

There is currently no established public trading market for our class B or class C common stock. There were 1,668 and 738 holders of record of our class B and class C common stock, respectively, as of   November 13, 2015  . 
  Dividend Declaration and Policy 
  During the fiscal years ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , we paid the following quarterly cash dividends per share of our class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock, on an as-converted basis) to all holders of record of our class A, B and C common stock.   

  Additionally, in   October 2015  , our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.14   per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock, on an as-converted basis) payable on   December 1, 2015  , to holders of record as of   November 13, 2015   of our class A, B and C common stock. 
     29 

     Table of Contents  

   Subject to legally available funds, we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding class A, B and C common stock in the future. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement indemnifications, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.  
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  The table below sets forth the information with respect to purchases of the Company s common stock made by or on behalf of the Company during the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .

  Selected Financial Data 

(1)   
    During fiscal 2013, we made payments from the litigation escrow account totaling $4.4 billion in connection with the U.S. covered litigation. During fiscal 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings, which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals. Certain merchants in the settlement classes objected to the settlement and filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants were received and deposited into the litigation escrow account, and a related increase in accrued litigation to address the opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. An additional accrual of   $450 million   associated with these opt-out claims was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, payments totaling   $426 million   were made from the litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with a number of individual opt-out merchants, resulting in an accrued balance of   $1.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2015  . See     Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities   and   Note 20 Legal Matters     to our consolidated financial statements included in   Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   of this report. 
               (2)   
    During fiscal 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of $296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities in fiscal 2015, of which $239 million relates to prior fiscal years. 
               (3)   
    During fiscal 2012, we recorded: a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities; a U.S. covered litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits; and the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and interest, which increased net income by $326 million.

    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
     This management s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Visa,   we,   our  and the  Company ) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report. 
    Overview 
  Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, including credit, debit and prepaid. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide. 
  Overall economic conditions.   Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2015 reflects the impacts of continued uneven and tepid economic growth.  
  Visa Europe acquisition  . On November 2, 2015, we entered into a transaction agreement with Visa Europe, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to  21.2 billion. The purchase price consists of: (a) at the closing of the transaction, up-front cash consideration of  11.5 billion and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, valued at approximately  5.0 billion, and (b) following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters post-closing, contingent cash consideration of up to  4.0 billion (plus up to an additional  0.7 billion in interest), determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such post-closing period. In conjunction with the transaction agreement, the Visa Europe put option was amended to align the terms on which Visa Europe may exercise its rights under the put option agreement with the terms of the transaction agreement. The purchase of Visa Europe's share capital will be effected through the exercise of the amended Visa Europe put option. The preferred stock conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, if any, which may be incurred by us, Visa Europe or its affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. As part of the acquisition, we also entered into the U.K. loss sharing agreement with Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europe s members located in the United Kingdom to compensate us for certain losses which may be incurred by us or Visa Europe as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom. See   Note 2 Visa Europe  ,   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  , and   Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements. The closing of our acquisition of Visa Europe is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and is currently expected to occur in our fiscal third quarter of 2016. 
  Financial highlights.   During fiscal 2015, we recorded net income of $6.3 billion or diluted class A earnings per share of $2.58, an increase of 16% and 20% over the prior year, respectively. Our non-GAAP adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:

    Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015 and 2014 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they either have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in   Adjusted financial results   below. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013. 
               (3)   
    The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015.  
     During fiscal 2015, we recognized a tax benefit of $296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Of the $296 million benefit, $239 million relates to prior fiscal years. Our financial results for the year ended September 30, 2014 reflect a one-time tax benefit of $191 million associated with a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities related to fiscal years 2013 and prior. See   Note 19 Income Taxes   to our consolidated financial statements. 
  We recorded net operating revenues of $13.9 billion for fiscal 2015, an increase of 9% over the prior year driven by continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year resulted in a two-and-a-half- percentage point decline in total operating revenue growth. 
  Total operating expenses for fiscal 2015 were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 4% over the prior year, primarily due to the absence of a $450 million litigation provision associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation recorded in fiscal 2014. Excluding this provision, operating expenses increased by 6% over prior year adjusted operating expenses, primarily due to increases in personnel, additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure, and general and administrative expenses. The increases were partially offset by decreases in network and processing and marketing expenses. 
  Adjusted financial results.   Our financial results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflect the impact of significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in the prior or future years, as they either have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. 
             
    Revaluation of Visa Europe put option.   During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded an increase of $110 million in the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating expense in our financial results. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore has no impact on our reported income tax provision. See   Note 2 Visa Europe     to our consolidated financial statements.  
                
    Litigation provision.   During fiscal 2014, we recorded a litigation provision of   $450 million   and related tax benefits associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision.     Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be paid from the litigation escrow account. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities   and   Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements. 
     The following tables present our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2015 and 2014. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013.

    The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015. 
     Class A common stock split.   In January 2015, Visa s board of directors declared a four-for-one split of its class A common stock. Each class A common stockholder of record at the close of business on February 13, 2015 ("Record Date") received a dividend of three additional shares on March 18, 2015 for every share held as of the Record Date. Trading began on a split-adjusted basis on March 19, 2015. Holders of class B and C common stock did not receive a stock dividend. Instead, the conversion rate for class B common stock increased to 1.6483 shares of class A common stock per share of class B common stock, and the conversion rate for class C common stock increased to 4.0 shares of class A common stock per share of class C common stock. Immediately following the split, the class A, B and C stockholders retained the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split. See   Note 14 Stockholders' Equity   to our consolidated financial statements. 
  Reduction in as-converted class A common stock.   During   fiscal 2015  , we repurchased   44 million   shares of our class A common stock in the open market using   $2.9 billion   of cash on hand. As of   September 30, 2015  , we had remaining authorized funds of   $2.8 billion  . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2014 have been completed. In   October 2015  , our board of directors authorized an additional   $5.0 billion     share repurchase program. See   Note 14 Stockholders' Equity   to our consolidated financial statements.  
    Nominal payments volume and transaction counts.   Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted strong growth in the United States, driven mainly by consumer credit. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015   (1)    was   13%   compared to   15%   for the prior year comparable period. Processed transactions sustained healthy growth reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency.

    Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.

    Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material.

    As a result of recent changes in Russian National Payment System law, we have transitioned the processing of Russian domestic transactions to the Russian National Payment Card System during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system does not reflect Russian domestic transactions processed after the transition. 
       Results of Operations  
  Operating Revenues  
  Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees.  
  The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues:  
  Service revenues   consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted.  
  Data processing revenues   are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. 
  International transaction revenues   are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. 
  Other revenues   consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from account holder services, certification and licensing, and other activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services.

     Table of Contents  

   Client incentives   consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues.  
  Operating Expenses  
  Personnel   includes salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation and contractor expense.  
  Marketing   includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand.  
  Network and processing   mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services.  
  Professional fees   mainly consist of fees for legal, consulting and other professional services.  
  Depreciation and amortization   includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions.  
  General and administrative   mainly consists of facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business.  
  Litigation provision   is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. 
  Non-operating (Expense) Income 
  Non-operating (expense) income   mainly includes the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, income, gains and losses earned on investments, and accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions.

  Operating Revenues  
  The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See   Note 2 Visa Europe   to our consolidated financial statements.

    Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. 
     The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives. Overall revenue growth also reflects the positive impact of select pricing modifications effected in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 combined with higher foreign currency exchange volatility on international transaction revenues.

     Table of Contents  

   Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2015, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an overall decline of about two-and-a-half percentage points in total operating revenue growth. 
  The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues. 

(1)   
    Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.  
                
    Service revenues   increased in   fiscal 2015   and   2014   primarily due to   7%   and   9%   growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. Service revenues also benefited from select pricing modifications which became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. 
                
    Data processing revenues   increased in   fiscal 2015   and   2014   due to overall growth in processed transactions of   9%   and   11%  , respectively.  
                
    International transaction revenues   increased in   fiscal 2015   primarily due to higher volatility in a broad range of currencies, combined with select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The   fiscal 2014   increase was primarily due to   8%   growth in nominal cross-border volume, partially offset by lower volatility in a broad range of currencies.  
                
    Client incentives   increased in   fiscal 2015   and   2014  , reflecting overall growth in global payments volume as well as incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2015 and 2014. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

   Operating Expenses 
  The following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses. 

(1)   
    Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. 
                 
    Personnel   increased in fiscal   2015   primarily due to a continued increase in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth, particularly in internal technology resources, combined with higher incentive compensation. The decrease in fiscal   2014   was mainly due to lower incentive compensation and severance charges, reductions in our net periodic pension cost and the absence of one-time share-based compensation expenses previously recognized in fiscal   2013  , partially offset by an increase in headcount. 
                
    Marketing   decreased in fiscal   2015   mainly due to the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar as marketing spend in local currencies was converted to U.S. dollars, combined with the absence of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and 2014 FIFA World Cup spend incurred in fiscal 2014. The decrease was partially offset by on-going advertising and promotional campaigns to support our growth strategies and new product initiatives, such as Visa Checkout, which began in the second half of fiscal 2014. The increase in marketing during fiscal   2014   compared to fiscal   2013   was also attributable to elevated spend supporting the two sporting campaigns.  
                
    Network and processing   in fiscal   2015   decreased as a result of initiatives to optimize the use of our technology resources. The increase in fiscal   2014   was mainly due to continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. 
                
    Professional fees   in fiscal 2015 were flat compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in fiscal   2014   was mainly due to the absence of certain project costs incurred in fiscal   2013   as part of our effort to align resources with our strategic priorities. 
                
    Depreciation and amortization   increased in fiscal   2015   and   2014  , primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. 
                
    General and administrative   increased in fiscal   2015   mainly due to an increase in travel activities, product enhancements and facilities costs in support of our business growth, combined with losses incurred from the sale of assets held by an international subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal   2015   upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currency and the absence of the fiscal 2014 disposal of obsolete technology assets. Fiscal 2014 increased mainly due to facilities costs and other corporate expenses, and the disposal of obsolete technology assets, partially offset by a decrease in travel activities.

Litigation provision   in     fiscal   2014     reflects a   $450 million     accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities   and   Note 20 Legal Matters     to our consolidated financial statements. 
       Non-operating (Expense) Income 
  Non-operating expense in fiscal   2015   primarily reflects a non-cash adjustment to the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option of $110 million, which is not subject to tax. The change in value did not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe would exercise its option in its unamended form at September 30, 2015. See   Note 2 Visa Europe     and     Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments   to our consolidated financial statements. Non-operating income in fiscal   2014   increased from fiscal 2013 primarily due to the absence of a $15 million other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2013. See   Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments   to our consolidated financial statements.  
    Effective Income Tax Rate  
  The effective income tax rates were   30%   in fiscal   2015   and   2014  . The following highlights the significant tax items recorded in each respective year: 
             
    a $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Included in the $296 million is a one-time $239 million tax benefit that relates to prior fiscal years; and 
                
    a $264 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2014 related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million was a one-time tax benefit related to prior fiscal years. 
     The effective income tax rate of   30%   in fiscal   2014   differs from the effective income tax rate of   31%   in fiscal   2013   mainly due to: 
               
    a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; and  
                
    certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013. 
       Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Management of Our Liquidity 
  We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. 
  The objectives of our treasury policies are to: 
             
    provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; 
                
    ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities;  
                
    ensure payments on required litigation settlements; 
                
    make planned capital investments in our business; 
                
    pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and 
                
    optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. 
     Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances.

   Cash Flow Data 
  The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 

Operating activiti  es. Reported cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, including: 
             
    payments of   $426 million   made from the litigation escrow account and a related decrease of approximately $157 million of income taxes paid during fiscal 2015;  
                
    the return of $1.1 billion in takedown payments in fiscal 2014 and related increase of $368 million in income taxes paid; and 
                
    payments of $4.4 billion made in fiscal 2013 from the litigation escrow account and a related decrease of $1.5 billion in overall income taxes paid. 
     The cash inflows and outflows related to the litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. 
  Absent the above impacts, cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 to approximately $6.9 billion, $6.5 billion, and $5.9 billion respectively, reflecting growth in total operating revenues in all three years. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities   and   Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. 
  Investing activities.   Cash used in investing activities was greater during fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in the proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, and an increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities. Cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, offset by an increase in cash used to acquire a business in which we previously held a minority interest. See   Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments   and   Note 7 Intangible Assets and Goodwill   to our consolidated financial statements. 
  Financing activities.   Reported financing activities reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above within operating activities as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. Additionally, reported financing activities in fiscal 2014 include deposits into the litigation escrow account of $450 million. Absent these impacts, which are related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, cash used in financing activities was $4.0 billion, $5.0 billion and $6.1 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The changes in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 are primarily due to the repurchase of class A common stock in the open market. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  ,   Note 14 Stockholders' Equity   and   Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements.  
  Sources of Liquidity  
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs.  
     42 

     Table of Contents  

   Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled   $7.0 billion   at   September 30, 2015  . If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the United States, we would be required to pay U.S. taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the United States. As such, we have not accrued a U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately   $6.4 billion   of undistributed earnings included in these funds. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. 
  Available-for-sale investment securities.   Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments,   $3.4 billion  , are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs.  
  Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See   Item 1A Risk Factors   included elsewhere in this report. 
  Commercial paper program  . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to   $3.0 billion   in outstanding notes, with maturities up to   397   days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at   September 30, 2015  . See   Note 9 Debt   to our consolidated financial statements. 
  Credit facility.   On   January 28, 2015  , we entered into an unsecured   $3.0 billion   revolving credit facility. The credit facility, which expires on   January 27, 2016  , replaced our previous   $3.0 billion   credit facility, which terminated on   January 28, 2015  . The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended   September 30, 2015  . See   Note 9 Debt   to our consolidated financial statements.  
  Universal shelf registration statement.   In July 2015, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2018. 
  Expected debt issuance and change in capital structure.   In conjunction with the potential Visa Europe acquisition, we intend to evolve our long-term capital structure. We intend to issue senior unsecured debt in an amount ranging between $15.0 billion and $16.0 billion in the first half of fiscal year 2016, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years, depending on market conditions. The proceeds from the debt issuance will be used to fund the upfront cash consideration of the acquisition, and increase the repurchase of class A common stock outstanding in 2016 and 2017 to offset the effect of the expected issuance of preferred stock upon the closing of the acquisition. Our initial leverage is expected to be between 1.4 and 1.5 times gross debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. We expect our long-term leverage to be between 1.1 and 1.5 times gross debt to EBITDA, maintaining flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities. We expect to maintain our current investment credit ratings disclosed below. 
  Litigation escrow account.   Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities   and   Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at   September 30, 2015  , was   $1.1 billion   and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under   Uses of Liquidity  , we do not rely on them for other operational needs.

   Credit Ratings 
  At   September 30, 2015  , our credit ratings by Standard and Poor s and Moody s were as follows:

Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets.  
  Uses of Liquidity  
  Payments settlement.   Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During   fiscal 2015  , we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $272 million. 
  Visa Europe acquisition.   On November 2, 2015, we entered into a transaction agreement to acquire Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to   21.2 billion. The purchase price consists of: (a) at the closing of the transaction, up-front cash consideration of  11.5 billion and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, valued at approximately  5.0 billion, and (b) following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters post-closing, contingent cash consideration of up to  4.0 billion (plus up to an additional  0.7 billion in interest), determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such post-closing period. Closing is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and is currently expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. See   Note 2 Visa Europe     to our consolidated financial statements  . 
  We also signed an option amendment, which amended the terms of the Visa Europe put option agreement to reflect the terms of the transaction agreement. If the acquisition of Visa Europe, as described above, is not completed, the put option will revert to its original, unamended form. The unamended put option agreement, if exercised, would require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. If the acquisition does not close and the put option reverts to its unamended terms, Visa Europe may exercise the unamended put option at any time thereafter. The unamended put option agreement provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the P/E ratio, at the time the unamended option is exercised, to Visa Europe's adjusted net income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, under the unamended terms, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, would be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The unamended put option agreement provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price.  
  The fair value of the unamended put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option under its unamended terms, which, under certain conditions, could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. At September 30, 2015, we determined the fair value of the unamended put option liability to be approximately $255 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the unamended put option at September 30, 2015, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised under its unamended terms. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised.

   Given the perpetual nature of the unamended put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $500 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $500 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at   September 30, 2015  , or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its put option in its unamended form, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $100 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $500 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At   September 30, 2015  , our estimated long-term P/E ratio was   21.3  x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was   1.5  x. At   September 30, 2015  , the spot P/E ratio was   23.2  x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was   1.8  x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future in its unamended form.

    Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. 
     U.S. Covered litigation.   We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During   fiscal 2015  , we made   $426 million   in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account, reflecting settlements with the individual opt-out merchants in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings. At   September 30, 2015  , the litigation escrow account had an available balance of   $1.1 billion  . See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities     and     Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements.  
  Other litigation.   Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs.  
  Reduction in as-converted class A common stock.   During   fiscal 2015  , we repurchased   44 million   shares of our class A common stock in the open market using   $2.9 billion   of cash on hand. As of   September 30, 2015  , we had remaining authorized funds of   $2.8 billion  . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to   October 2014   have been completed. In   October 2015  , our board of directors authorized an additional   $5.0 billion   share repurchase program. See   Note 14 Stockholders' Equity   to our consolidated financial statements. 
  Dividends  . During   fiscal 2015  , we paid   $1.2 billion   in dividends. In   October 2015  , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of   $0.14   per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately   $341 million   in connection with this dividend on   December 1, 2015  . See   Note 14 Stockholders' Equity     to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. Holders of class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.  
  Pension and other postretirement benefits.   We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also  
     45 

     Table of Contents  

   sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of   $19 million  ,   $14 million  , and   $4 million  , respectively. In   fiscal 2016  , given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately   $12 million  . The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. See   Note 10 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits   to our consolidated financial statements. 
  Capital expenditures.   Our capital expenditures decreased during   fiscal 2015   reflecting the investments to upgrade our processing network during the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.  
  Acquisitions.   During   fiscal 2015   and   fiscal 2014  , we acquired businesses in which we previously held a minority interest using $93 million and $134 million of cash on hand, respectively. These amounts primarily reflect the respective purchase price, less cash received. These acquisitions help to expand our loyalty solutions for merchants by strengthening our merchant offers capabilities, and extend our processing capabilities internationally. See   Note 7 Intangible Assets and Goodwill     to our consolidated financial statements. 
  Fair Value Measurements Financial Instruments  
  The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of   September 30, 2015  , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately   $9.3 billion   of assets and   $268 million   of liabilities. Of these instruments,   $262 million   had significant unobservable inputs, including the unamended Visa Europe put option liability of   $255 million  , and   $7 million   of auction rate securities. See   Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments   to our consolidated financial statements. 
    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
  Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table.  
  Indemnifications  
  We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See     Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     and     Note 11 Settlement Guarantee Management   to our consolidated financial statements. 
  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement.  
  Contractual Obligations  
  Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2015. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities.

    Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in   Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies   to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record.  
               (4)   
    Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa-branded product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent.  
                (6)   
    We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of   $752 million  . At September 30, 2015, we had also accrued   $33 million   of interest and   $6 million   of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. 
               (7)   
    On November 2, 2015, we entered into an agreement to acquire Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to  21.2 billion to be paid in a combination of up-front cash, preferred stock, and contingent cash consideration due four years after closing. As the agreement was signed after the balance sheet date, and closing of the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, the maximum potential purchase price is not included in the table above. Additionally, in conjunction with the agreement to acquire Visa Europe, we also entered into an option amendment, which amended the terms of the Visa Europe put option to align with the terms of the transaction agreement to acquire Visa Europe. If the acquisition does not close, the Visa Europe put option will revert to its original, unamended terms. Due to the perpetual nature of the unamended instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist if the unamended put were exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the current economic conditions and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its unamended option, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. The fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option itself totaling   $255 million   at September 30, 2015 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See the   Liquidity and Capital Resources   and   Critical Accounting Estimates   sections of this   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   and   Note 2 Visa Europe   to our consolidated financial statements.

    We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See   Note 10 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits     to our consolidated financial statements and the   Liquidity and Capital Resources s  ection of this   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
       Critical Accounting Estimates  
  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See   Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.  
  We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.  
  Revenue Recognition     Client Incentives  
  Critical estimates.   We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. 
  Assumptions and judgment.   Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients.  
  Impact if actual results differ from assumptions.   If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended   September 30, 2015  , client incentives represented   17%   of gross operating revenues. 
  Fair Value     Visa Europe Put Option  
  Critical estimates.   On November 2, 2015, the Visa Europe put option was amended in conjunction with our agreement to acquire Visa Europe. At September 30, 2015, the fair value of the put option liability was based on the unamended terms. If the acquisition of Visa Europe, described in   Note 2 Visa Europe  , is not completed, the put option will revert to its original, unamended form. If the put option is exercised under its unamended terms, we will be required to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The unamended put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the P/E ratio, at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted net income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income.  
     48 

     Table of Contents  

   The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items.  
  Upon exercise of the unamended put option, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, would be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The unamended put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See   Note 2 Visa Europe   to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the unamended agreement.  
  The fair value of Visa Europe's unamended option was estimated to be approximately   $255 million   at   September 30, 2015  . While the unamended put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the unamended put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the unamended put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option in its unamended form.  
  While this amount represents the fair value of the unamended put option at   September 30, 2015  , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the unamended option is exercised. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. See the   Liquidity and Capital Resources   section of   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   for further discussion.  
  Assumptions and judgment.   The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the unamended put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option in its unamended form, and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the unamended put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential.  
  Probability of exercise   Exercise of the unamended put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, including under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on the unamended terms of the put option agreement and other reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions (if any) to exercise the put option in its unamended form; (ii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iii) other qualitative factors including, but not limited to, qualitative factors related to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings.  
  P/E differential   The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the unamended put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the  long-term P/E calculation ) and the last 30 trading dates (the  30-day P/E calculation ) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the unamended put option, that a market participant would more heavily weigh long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators.  
  Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolios, long-term growth rates or new product innovations. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings  
     49 

     Table of Contents  

   multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies.  
  Other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. Growth rates assumed in the valuation reflect a for-profit model, as we believe it is likely that, should Visa Europe choose to exercise the put option in its unamended form, it will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the unamended put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the unamended put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value.  
  Impact if actual results differ from assumptions.   In the determination of the fair value of the unamended put option at   September 30, 2015  , we have assumed a   40%   probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately   1.5  x. The use of a probability of exercise that is   5%   higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately   $37 million   in the value of the unamended put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately   $249 million   in the value of the unamended put option. The unamended put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the unamended put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2015  . Classification in current liabilities reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months at   September 30, 2015  .  
  Legal and Regulatory Matters  
  Critical estimates.   We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements.  
  Assumptions and judgment.   We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates.  
  Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. We did not record an accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2015. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities   and   Note 20 Legal Matters   to our consolidated financial statements.  
  Impact if actual results differ from assumptions.   Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See   Note 20 Legal Matters     to our consolidated financial statements.  
  Income Taxes  
  Critical estimates.   In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions.  
  Assumptions and judgment.   We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities.  
  Impact if actual results differ from assumptions.   Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by  
     50 

     Table of Contents  

   the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.  
             ITEM 7A. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
     Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis.  
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements.  
  The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were   $1.2 billion   and   $1.3 billion   at   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at   September 30, 2015   is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical   10%   change in the value of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately   $91 million   on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2015  . See   Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     and     Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments     to our consolidated financial statements. 
  We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties.  
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates.  
  The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at   September 30, 2015   and   2014   were   $4.4 billion   and   $3.0 billion  , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately   $48 million   on our fixed-rate investment securities at   September 30, 2015  . The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were   $1.7 billion   and   $1.9 billion   at   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.  
  Visa Europe Put Option 
  We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe, which is recorded at fair value at   September 30, 2015   based on its unamended terms. We are required to assess the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as necessary. In the determination of the fair value of the unamended put option at   September 30, 2015  , we assumed a   40%   probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately   1.5  x. The use of a probability of exercise   5%   higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately   $37 million   in the value of the unamended put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately   $249  
     51

   million   in the value of the unamended put option. See   Liquidity and Capital Resources   and   Critical Accounting Estimates   above.  
  Pension Plan Risk 
  At   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were   $1.0 billion   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively, and projected benefit obligations were   $1.0 billion   and   $983 million  , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical   10%   decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a   1%   decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately   $248 million   in the funded status and an increase of approximately   $30 million   in pension cost. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for   fiscal 2016  , if any, which would be made in September 2016.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
  Visa Inc.: 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended   September 30, 2015  . We also have audited Visa Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2015  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Visa Inc. s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended   September 30, 2015  , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Visa Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2015  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  September 30, 2015 
    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  Organization  . In a series of transactions from October 1 to October 3, 2007, Visa Inc. ("Visa" or the "Company") undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc. ("Visa U.S.A."), Visa International Service Association ("Visa International"), Visa Canada Corporation ("Visa Canada") and Inovant LLC ("Inovant") became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa and established the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan (the "October 2007 reorganization" or "reorganization"). See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  . The reorganization was reflected as a single transaction on October 1, 2007 using the purchase method of accounting with Visa U.S.A. as the accounting acquirer. Visa Europe Limited ("Visa Europe") did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned and governed by its European member financial institutions. See   Note 2 Visa Europe  .  
  Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than   200   countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited ( VWPL ), Visa Canada, Inovant and CyberSource Corporation ( CyberSource ), operate one of the world's most advanced processing networks   VisaNet   which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa-branded cards and payment products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients. Visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders: pay now with debit, pay ahead with prepaid or pay later with credit products. These services facilitate transactions on Visa's network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally. 
  Consolidation and basis of presentation  . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities ( VIEs ) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company's investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  
  On March 18, 2015, the Company completed a   four  -for-one split of its class A common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. See   Note 14 Stockholders' Equity  .  
  Beginning in fiscal 2015, current income tax receivable is included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line. Previously, it had been presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets. All prior period amounts within the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The reclassification did not affect the Company's financial position, total operating revenues, net income, comprehensive income, or cash flows as of and for the periods presented.  
  The Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has   one   reportable segment, Payment Services. 
  Use of estimates  . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. 
  Cash and cash equivalents  . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. 
     65

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  September 30, 2015 

   Restricted cash litigation escrow  . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities   and   Note 20 Legal Matters   for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Investments and fair value.   The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See   Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments  .   The classification of the Company s financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: 
  Level 1   Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company s Level 1 assets include money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities.  
  Level 2   Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, corporate debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments. 
  Level 3   Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities include auction rate securities and the Visa Europe put option.  
  Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations.  
  Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. The majority of these investments are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations.  
  The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company has not presented required separate disclosures because its gross unrealized loss positions in debt or equity securities for the periods presented are not material. 
  The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between   20%   and   50%   ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Company s share of each entity s profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships  
     66 

     Table of Contents  
  VISA INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  September 30, 2015 

   and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than   5%   of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. 
  The Company applies the cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than   20%   ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than   5%   and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. 
  Financial instruments  . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash-litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, derivative instruments, and the Visa Europe put option. See   Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments  . 
  Settlement receivable and payable  . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. U.S. dollar settlements with the Company's financial institution clients are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  Customer collateral  . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa-branded cards and payment products processed in accordance with the Company's rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See   Note 11 Settlement Guarantee Management  . 
  Client incentives.   The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over Visa's network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. See   Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies  . 
  Property, equipment and technology, net  . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the asset s estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from   2   to   7   years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between   3   and   40   years, and buildings are depreciated over   40   years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset s remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service.

   Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology's estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. 
  The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See   Note 6 Property, Equipment and Technology, Net  . 
  Leases  . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
  Intangible assets, net  . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. 
  Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from   3   to   15   years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of   September 30, 2015  . See   Note 7 Intangible Assets and Goodwill  . 
  Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and the Visa Europe franchise right acquired in the October 2007 reorganization. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques.  
  The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of   February 1, 2015  , and concluded there was   no   impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of   September 30, 2015  . 
  Goodwill  . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.  
  The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on   February 1, 2015  , and concluded there was   no   impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of   September 30, 2015  . 
  Accrued litigation  . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company's defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ  
     68 

     Table of Contents  
  VISA INC.

  September 30, 2015 

   materially from the Company's estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See   Note 20 Legal Matters  .  
  Revenue recognition  . The Company's operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. 
  Service revenues consist of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted.  
  Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.  
  International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume.  
  Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement (see     Note 2 Visa Europe  ), fees from account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. 
  Marketing.   The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs.  
  Income taxes  . The Company's income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies.  
  Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See   Note 19 Income Taxes  . 
  Pension and other postretirement benefit plans  . The Company s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the  
     69 

     Table of Contents  
  VISA INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  September 30, 2015 

   discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a "bond duration matching" methodology, which reflects the matching of projected plan obligation cash flows to an average of high-quality corporate bond yield curves whose duration matches the projected cash flows. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a   10%   corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately   9   years for plans in the United States. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. 
  The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See   Note 10 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  .  
  Foreign currency remeasurement and translation  . The Company's functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013.  
  For certain foreign operations, the Company's functional currency may be the local currency in which a foreign subsidiary executes its business transactions. Translation from the local currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets.  
  Derivative financial instruments  . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2015, derivatives outstanding mature within 12 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations (in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective) depending on whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. Fair value represents the difference in the value of the derivative instruments at the contractual rate and the value at current market rates, and generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. See   Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments  . 
  Guarantees and indemnifications  . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence.

   performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management's best estimate throughout the performance period. See   Note 16 Share-based Compensation  .  
  Earnings per share  . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock.

  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
  In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-04, which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, which clarifies the applicable guidance for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity, or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, which provides guidance for the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018.The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the full effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which requires a performance target in stock compensation awards that affects vesting, and is achievable after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts and premiums. Subsequently, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, which adds SEC staff guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, allowing for the deferral and presentation of debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequent amortization of the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company will adopt the standards effective October 1, 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, which provides guidance about a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendment will help entities evaluate whether such an arrangement includes a software license, which should be accounted for consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses; otherwise, it should be accounted for as a service contract. The Company will adopt the standard

   effective October 1, 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, which simplifies the accounting for post-acquisition adjustments by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for the adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The Company plans to early adopt this guidance on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
    Note 2 Visa Europe    
  Acquisition of Visa Europe 
  On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into a transaction agreement, pursuant to which the Company and Visa Europe agreed on the terms and conditions of the Company s acquisition of   100%   of the share capital of Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to    21.2 billion  . The purchase price consists of: (a) at the closing of the transaction, up-front cash consideration of    11.5 billion   and preferred stock of the Company convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock of the Company, as described below, valued at approximately    5.0 billion  , and (b) following the end of   sixteen   fiscal quarters post-closing, contingent cash consideration of up to    4.0 billion   (plus up to an additional    0.7 billion   in interest), determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such post-closing period. The board of directors of the Company and Visa Europe have each unanimously supported the transaction agreement and the matters contemplated thereby. Closing is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and is currently expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. 
  Transaction agreement and option amendment  . The transaction agreement provides for the acquisition to be effected pursuant to the exercise of the amended Visa Europe put option, as described further below. In connection with the execution of the transaction agreement, the Company and Visa Europe have amended the Visa Europe put option to align the terms on which Visa Europe may exercise its rights under the put option agreement with the terms of the transaction agreement, including the economic terms and timing. The transaction agreement prohibits Visa Europe from exercising the put option prior to closing of the transaction and, if the transaction agreement is terminated without completion of the acquisition, the Visa Europe put option will revert to its original, unamended form. The transaction agreement may be terminated by the Company or Visa Europe, subject to specified exceptions, if the transaction is not consummated by August 2, 2016, or if legal restraints that prohibit the closing have become final and non-appealable.  
  Preferred stock  . In connection with the transaction, the board of directors of the Company has authorized the creation of three new series of preferred stock of the Company:   
             
    series A convertible participating preferred stock, par value   $0.0001   per share, which is designed to be economically equivalent to the Company s class A common stock (the  class A equivalent preferred stock  
                
    series B convertible participating preferred stock, par value   $0.0001   per share (the  U.K. I preferred stock  and 
                
    series C convertible participating preferred stock, par value   $0.0001   per share (the  Europe preferred stock ).  
     The transaction agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, at closing, the Company will issue   2,480,500   shares of U.K. I preferred stock to those of Visa Europe s member financial institutions in the United Kingdom and Ireland that are entitled to receive preferred stock at closing, and   3,157,000   shares of Europe preferred stock to those of Visa Europe s other member financial institutions that are entitled to receive preferred stock at closing. Subject to the reduction in conversion rates described below, the U.K. I preferred stock will be convertible into a number of shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock valued at approximately    2.2 billion   and the Europe preferred stock will be convertible into a number of shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock valued at approximately    2.8 billion  . These approximate values of the UK I and Europe preferred stock to be issued at closing are based on the average price of the class A common stock of   $71.68   per share, and the euro-dollar exchange rate of   1.12750   for the   30   trading days ended October 19, 2015.

     Table of Contents  
  VISA INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  September 30, 2015 

   The UK I and Europe preferred stock will be convertible into shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, at an initial conversion rate of   13.952   shares of class A common stock for each share of U.K. I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, if any, which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. A reduction in the conversion rates of the U.K. I preferred stock and the Europe preferred stock have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock because it reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. Additionally, the shares of U.K. I and Europe preferred stock will be subject to restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the existing and potential litigation. The shares of U.K. I and Europe preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of closing, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-pending claims. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  . 
  Upon issuance of the preferred stock at closing, the holders of the U.K. I and Europe preferred stock will have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including, in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company. Holders of the class A equivalent preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the U.K. I and Europe preferred stock. With respect to those limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the holders of the preferred stock requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. Once issued, all three series of preferred stock will participate on an as-converted basis in regular quarterly cash dividends declared on the Company's class A common stock. 
  U.K. loss sharing agreement and litigation management deed  . On November 2, 2015, the Company, Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europe s member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (the  U.K. LSA members ) entered into a loss sharing agreement (the  U.K. loss sharing agreement ), pursuant to which each of the U.K. LSA members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and, with respect to each U.K. LSA member, up to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration to be received by such U.K. LSA member. The U.K. LSA members  obligations under the U.K. loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, the acquisition closing, and additionally upon either (a) losses valued at in excess of the sterling equivalent at closing of    1.0 billion   having arisen in claims relating to the U.K. domestic multilateral interchange fees (with such losses being recoverable through reductions in the conversion rate of the U.K. I preferred stock), or (b) the conversion rate of the UK I preferred stock having been reduced to   zero   pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate setting in the Visa Europe territory, as described above. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  . 
  Prior to closing, the Company and the other parties thereto will enter into a litigation management deed, which will set forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the existing and potential litigation, as described above, relating to the setting and implementation of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the "Europe covered claims"), the allocation of losses resulting from the Europe covered claims, and any accelerated conversion or reduction in the conversion rate of the shares of U.K. I and Europe preferred stock. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the litigation management deed provides that the Company will generally control the conduct of the Europe covered claims, subject to certain obligations to report and consult with newly established Europe litigation management committees. The Europe litigation management committees, which will be composed of representatives of certain Visa Europe members, will also be granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the Europe covered claims. 
  Historical Relationship with Visa Europe 
  As part of Visa's October 2007 reorganization, Visa Europe exchanged its ownership interest in Visa International and Inovant for Visa common stock  ,   a put-call option agreement and a Framework Agreement, as described below. While the Visa Europe put option agreement has been amended by the option amendment  
     73 

     Table of Contents  
  VISA INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  September 30, 2015 

   described above, the Visa Europe put option agreement will revert to its original, unamended form if the transaction agreement is terminated without completion of the acquisition. 
  Visa Europe put option agreement.   As discussed above, on November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe amended the Visa Europe put option. At September 30, 2015, the fair value of the put option liability was based on the unamended terms. 
  The unamended put option agreement, if exercised, would require Visa to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The Company is required to purchase the shares of Visa Europe no later than   285   days after exercise of the unamended put option. The unamended put option agreement provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the P/E ratio, at the time the unamended option is exercised, to Visa Europe's adjusted net income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, under the unamended terms, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, would be the result of negotiation between the Company and Visa Europe. The unamended put option agreement provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. 
  The fair value of the unamended put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option under its unamended terms, which, under certain conditions, could obligate the Company to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. The fair value of the unamended put option does not represent the actual purchase price that the Company may be required to pay if the unamended option is exercised. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of   $15 billion  . While the unamended put option is in fact non-transferable, its fair value represents the Company's estimate of the amount the Company would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. 
  The fair value of the unamended put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the unamended put option agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's-length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe may never exercise its option in its unamended form. 
  The estimated fair value of the unamended put option represents a Level 3 accounting estimate due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. See   Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments  . The valuation of the unamended put option therefore requires substantial judgment. The most subjective of estimates applied in valuing the unamended put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option in its unamended form, and the estimated differential between the P/E ratio and the P/E ratio applicable to Visa Europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise, which the Company refers to as the  P/E differential.  
  Exercise of the unamended put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, including under its Articles of Association). The Company estimates the assumed probability of exercise based on the unamended terms of the put option agreement and other reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions (if any) to exercise the put option in its unamended form; (ii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iii) other qualitative factors including, but not limited to, qualitative factors related to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. Factors impacting the assumed P/E differential used in the calculation include material changes in the P/E ratio of Visa and those of a group of comparable companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. 
  The Company determined the fair value of the unamended put option to be approximately   $255 million   at   September 30, 2015   and   $145 million     at     September 30, 2014  . The increase in value was primarily driven by an  
     74 

     Table of Contents  
  VISA INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  September 30, 2015 

   increase in estimated Visa Europe adjusted sustainable income partially offset by a decrease in the P/E differential. In determining the fair value of the unamended put option on these dates, the Company assumed a   40%   probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of   1.5  x and   1.9  x, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the put option are recorded as non-cash, non-operating expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.  
   At September 30, 2015, the unamended put option was exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the unamended put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2015  . Classification in current liabilities reflects the fact that the obligation resulting from the exercise of the instrument could become payable within 12 months at   September 30, 2015  .  
  Visa call option agreement.   Visa Europe granted to Visa a perpetual call option under which the Company may be entitled to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe. The Company may exercise the call option in the event of certain triggering events. These triggering events involve the performance of Visa Europe measured as an unremediated decline in the number of merchants or ATM's in the Visa Europe region that accepts Visa-branded products. The Company believes the likelihood of these events occurring is remote.  
  The Framework Agreement.   Subject to the binding documents entered into in connection with the proposed transaction, the relationship between Visa and Visa Europe is governed by a Framework Agreement, which provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services as described below.  
  The Company granted to Visa Europe exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property owned by the Company and certain affiliates within the Visa Europe region for use in the field of financial services, payments, related information technology and information processing services and participation in the Visa system. Visa Europe may sublicense the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property to its members and other sublicensees under agreed-upon circumstances.  
  The base fee for these irrevocable and perpetual licenses is recorded in other revenues and was approximately   $143 million   per year for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . This fee is eligible for adjustment annually based on the annual growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, although the adjustment can never reduce the annual fee below   $143 million  . The Company determined through an analysis of the fee rates implied by the economics of the agreement that the base fee, as adjusted in future periods based on the growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, approximates fair value.  
  In addition to the licenses, Visa provides Visa Europe with authorization, clearing and settlement services for cross-border transactions involving Visa Europe's region and the rest of the world. Visa Europe must comply with certain agreed-upon global rules governing the interoperability of Visa's systems with the systems of Visa Europe as well as the use and interoperability of the Visa trademarks. The parties will also guarantee the obligations of their respective clients and members to settle transactions, manage certain relationships with sponsors, clients and merchants, and comply with rules relating to the operation of the Visa enterprise. Under the Framework Agreement, the Company indemnifies Visa Europe for claims arising from the Company s or Visa Europe s activities that are brought outside of Visa Europe s region; and Visa Europe likewise indemnifies the Company for such claims brought within Visa Europe s region. However, Visa Europe has informed us of its view that it is not obligated to indemnify the Company or Visa International for any claim relating to the European Competition Proceedings, including claims asserted in both the European Commission matter and the U.K. Merchant Litigation. The Company continues to firmly believe that Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify the Company for all such claims. See   Note 20 Legal Matters  . 
   The Company has not recorded liabilities associated with these obligations as the fair value of such obligations was determined to be insignificant at   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. The Company has determined that the value of services exchanged as a result of these various agreements approximates fair value at   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.

   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities    
  U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan 
  The Company has established several related mechanisms designed to address potential liability under certain litigation referred to as the  U.S. covered litigation." These mechanisms are included in and referred to as the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan, and consist of a litigation escrow agreement, the conversion feature of the Company's shares of class B common stock, the indemnification obligations of the Visa U.S.A. members, an interchange judgment sharing agreement, a loss sharing agreement, and an omnibus agreement, as amended.  
  U.S. covered litigation consists of: 
             
    the Discover Litigation  . Discover Financial Services Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., Case No. 04-CV-07844 (S.D.N.Y) (settled);  
                
    the American Express Litigation  . American Express Travel Related Services Co., Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc. et al., No. 04-CV-0897 (S.D.N.Y.), which the Company refers to as the American Express litigation (settled);  
                
    the Attridge Litigation  . Attridge v. Visa U.S.A. Inc. et al., Case No. CGC-04-436920 (Cal. Super.)(dismissed with prejudice);  
                
    the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation  . In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.) or MDL 1720, including all cases currently included in MDL 1720, any other case that includes claims for damages relating to the period prior to the Company's IPO that has been or is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction and Kendall v. Visa U.S.A., Inc. et al., Case No. CO4-4276 JSW (N.D. Cal.);  
                
    any claim that challenges the reorganization or the consummation thereof; provided that such claim is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction; and 
                
    any case brought after October 22, 2015, by an opt out of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. 
     Litigation escrow agreement.   In accordance with the litigation escrow agreement, the Company maintains an escrow account, from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. The amount of the escrow is determined by the board of directors and the Company's litigation committee, all members of which are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with the interest earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets.  
  The following table sets forth the changes in the litigation escrow account:  

(1)    
    These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See   Note 20 Legal Matters  . 
     An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a change to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available

   information, including but not limited to recommendations made by the litigation committee. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2015. See   Note 20 Legal Matters  .  
  Conversion feature.   Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See   Note 14 Stockholders' Equity  .  
  Indemnification obligations  . To the extent that amounts available under the litigation escrow arrangement and other agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the U.S. covered litigation, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.'s members for such excess amount, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements.  
  Interchange judgment sharing agreement.   Visa U.S.A. and Visa International have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is described in   Note 20 Legal Matters  . Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of MasterCard. 
  Loss sharing agreement.   Visa has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the U.S. covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a U.S. covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.'s specified voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a U.S. covered litigation, multiplied by such bank's then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation. 
  On October 22, 2015, Visa entered into an amendment to the loss sharing agreement. The amendment includes within the scope of U.S. covered litigation any action brought after the amendment by an opt out from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. On the same date, Visa entered into amendments to the interchange judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of those agreements as well. 
  Omnibus agreement.   Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with MasterCard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories  intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation, see   Note 20 Legal Matters  .   Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at   33.3333%   and a Visa portion at   66.6667%  . In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a MasterCard portion at   33.3333%   and a Visa portion at   66.6667%  . The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the Company's U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on the consolidated statements of operations is not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement.

   On August 26, 2014, Visa entered into an amendment to the omnibus agreement. The omnibus amendment makes applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing provisions of the omnibus agreement, pursuant to which the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at   33.3333%   and a Visa portion at   66.6667%  . The omnibus amendment also provides that in the event of termination of the class Settlement Agreement, Visa and MasterCard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds and MasterCard shall have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of the termination of the Settlement Agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to defendants.  
  Potential Visa Europe Liabilities 
  On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into a transaction agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Visa Europe. Closing of the acquisition is subject to various conditions including regulatory approvals, and is expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Visa Inc., Visa Europe or their affiliates are, or may become, a party to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. The background to the existing proceedings is within   European Competition Proceedings   and   U.K. Merchant Litigation   in   Note 20 Legal Matters  . The Company has obtained certain protection in respect of losses resulting from existing and potential litigation through the preferred stock and the U.K. loss sharing agreement, and has agreed to certain terms regarding the conduct of such litigation, all of which is conditioned on the closing of the acquisition of Visa Europe by the Company.

   Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. See   Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  .  
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

There were   no   transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal   2015  . 
  Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis.   Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets.  
  Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.   The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and corporate debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Commercial paper and foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal   2015  . 
  Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.   Auction rate securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There  
     79

  September 30, 2015 

   were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal   2015  .  
  Visa Europe put option agreement.   On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe amended the Visa Europe put option. At   September 30, 2015  , the fair value of the put option liability was based on the unamended terms. The fair value of the unamended put option was   $255 million   at   September 30, 2015   and   $145 million   at   September 30, 2014  . Changes in fair value are recorded as non-cash, non-operating expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. See   Note 2 Visa Europe  .   The liability is classified within Level 3 as the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option in its unamended form, and the estimated P/E differential are among several unobservable inputs used to value the unamended put option.  
  Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 
  Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method  . These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management's judgment. When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The Company recognized a   $15 million   other-than-temporary impairment loss related to these investments during   fiscal 2013  . There were no significant impairment charges incurred during   fiscal 2015   and   fiscal 2014  . At   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , these investments totaled   $45 million   and   $35 million  , respectively. These assets are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. See   Note 5 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets  . 
  Non-financial assets and liabilities.   Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names, and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. See     Note 7 Intangible Assets and Goodwill  . 
  If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management's judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of   February 1, 2015  , and concluded that there was   no   impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at   September 30, 2015  . See   Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  . 
  Other Financial Instruments not Measured at Fair Value 
  The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2015  , but require disclosure of their fair values: time deposits recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, settlement receivable and payable, and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at   September 30, 2015  , approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

   Investments 
  Trading Investment Securities  
  Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. As of   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , trading investment securities totaled   $66 million   and   $69 million  , respectively.  
  Available-for-sale Investment Securities  
  The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses and fair value of available-for-sale investment securities are as follows:  

The available-for-sale investment securities primarily include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and corporate debt securities. The Company recognized   $5 million   of other-than-temporary impairment losses on available-for-sale equity securities during fiscal 2015. Available-for-sale debt securities are presented below in accordance with their stated maturities. The majority of these investments,   $3.4 billion  , are classified as non-current, as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs.

  Property, equipment and technology, net, consisted of the following: 

Technology consists of both purchased and internally developed software. Internally developed software primarily represents software utilized by the VisaNet electronic payments network. At   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , accumulated amortization for technology was   $1.4 billion   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2015  , estimated future amortization expense on technology was as follows: 

Depreciation and amortization expense related to property, equipment and technology was   $431 million  ,   $369 million   and   $328 million   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Included in those amounts was amortization expense on technology of   $251 million  ,   $198 million   and   $173 million   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
    Note 7 Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
  At   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company s indefinite-lived intangible assets consisted of customer relationships of   $6.8 billion  , Visa trade name of   $2.6 billion   and a Visa Europe franchise right of   $1.5 billion  , all of which were acquired as part of the Company s October 2007 reorganization. Customer relationships represent the value of relationships with clients outside of the United States, excluding the European Union. Trade names represent the value of the Visa brand outside of the United States, excluding the European Union. Visa Europe s franchise right represents the value of the right to franchise the use of the Visa brand, use of Visa technology and access to the overall Visa network in the European Union.

   Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets consisted of the following:    

Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was   $63 million  ,   $66 million   and   $69 million   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. At   September 30, 2015  , estimated future amortization expense on finite-lived intangible assets is as follows: 

There was   no   impairment related to the Company s indefinite-lived or finite-lived intangible assets during fiscal   2015  ,   2014   or   2013  .  
  In August 2014, the Company entered into a license agreement with one of its strategic partners, in which it previously held a minority interest. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Total consideration under the license agreement was approximately   $15 million  , of which   $12 million   was recorded as goodwill. Subsequently, in April 2015, the Company acquired   100%   of the outstanding shares of the strategic partner. The total purchase consideration was approximately   $116 million  , excluding the Company's previously held minority interest, paid primarily with cash on hand. Total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and to liabilities assumed based on their respective fair value on the acquisition date. Related finite-lived intangible assets recorded, comprised primarily of customer relationships, totaled   $13 million   with a weighted-average useful life of   6.7   years. Goodwill of   $72 million   was recorded to reflect the excess purchase consideration over net assets acquired.  
  In April 2014, the Company acquired a business in which it previously held a minority interest. Total purchase consideration was approximately   $170 million  , paid primarily with cash on hand. Total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date. Related indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded totaled   $126 million  . Goodwill of   $60 million   was recorded to reflect the excess purchase consideration over net assets assumed.  
  The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquired businesses from the dates of acquisition. Pro forma information related to the acquisitions have not been presented as the impacts are not material to the Company's financial results.

   Note 8 Accrued and Other Liabilities    
  Accrued liabilities consisted of the following:   

  Other non-current liabilities consisted of the following:   

            (1)   
    On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe amended the Visa Europe put option. At September 30, 2015, the fair value of the put option liability was based on the unamended terms, and the unamended put option was exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe with payment required   285   days thereafter. Classification in current liabilities reflects the fact that the obligation resulting from the exercise of the unamended instrument could become payable within 12 months at   September 30, 2015  . The fair value of the unamended put option does not represent the actual purchase price that the Company may be required to pay if the option is exercised in its unamended form, which would likely be in excess of   $15 billion  . During fiscal 2015, we recorded an increase of   $110 million   in the fair value of the unamended put option. See   Note 2 Visa Europe  .  
               (2)   
    The decrease in non-current accrued income taxes is primarily related to decreases in liabilities for uncertain tax positions. 
       Note 9 Debt    
  Commercial paper program.   Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to   $3.0 billion   in outstanding notes, with maturities up to   397   days from the date of issuance. The Company had   no   outstanding obligations under the program at   September 30, 2015  . 
  Credit facility.   On   January 28, 2015  , the Company entered into an unsecured   $3.0 billion   revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility, which expires on   January 27, 2016  , replaced the Company's previous   $3.0 billion   credit facility, which terminated on   January 28, 2015  . The Credit Facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The participating lenders in the Credit Facility include affiliates of certain holders of the Company's class B and class C common stock and some of the Company's clients or affiliates of its clients. This facility is maintained to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by the Company's clients, to back up the commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.  
  Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility would be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. Visa also agreed to pay a commitment fee, which will fluctuate based  
     85 

     Table of Contents  
  VISA INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  September 30, 2015 

   on the credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. Currently, the applicable margin is   0.00%   to   0.75%   depending on the type of the loan, and the commitment fee is   0.07%  . There were   no   borrowings under either facility and the Company was in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended and as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    Note 10 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits    
  The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. The Company also sponsors other pension benefit plans that provide benefits for internationally-based employees at certain non-U.S. locations, which are not presented below as they are not material. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 
  Defined benefit pension plans.   The benefits under the current defined benefit pension plan are earned based on a cash balance formula. An employee s cash balance account is credited with an amount equal to   6%   of eligible compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. The funding policy is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution under ERISA.    
  Postretirement benefits plan.   The postretirement benefits plan provides medical benefits for retirees and dependents who meet minimum age and service requirements. Benefits are provided from retirement date until age   65  . Retirees must contribute on a monthly basis for the same coverage that is generally available to active employees and their dependents. The Company s contributions are funded on a current basis.

    Based on a  bond duration matching  methodology, which reflects the matching of projected plan liability cash flows to an average of high-quality corporate bond yield curves whose duration matches the projected cash flows.

    Primarily based on the targeted allocation, and evaluated for reasonableness by considering such factors as: (i) actual return on plan assets; (ii) historical rates of return on various asset classes in the portfolio; (iii) projections of returns on various asset classes; and (iv) current and prospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts. 
     The assumed annual rate of future increases in health benefits for the other postretirement benefits plan is   8%   for   fiscal 2016  . The rate is assumed to decrease to   5%   by 2021 and remain at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect management s expectations of future rates. Increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend by   1%   would change the postretirement plan benefit obligation by less than   $1 million  . 
  Pension Plan Assets 
  Pension plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Pension plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. 
  Pension plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances the pension plan assets, as appropriate, to ensure that allocations are consistent with target allocation ranges. The current target allocation for pension plan assets is as follows: equity securities of   50%   to   80%  , fixed income securities of   25%   to   35%   and other, primarily consisting of cash equivalents to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to   7%  . At   September 30, 2015  , pension plan asset allocations for the above categories were   66%  ,   33%   and   1%  , respectively, which were within target allocation ranges.  
  The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the pension plan s investments at fair value as of   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , including the impact of unsettled transactions: 

(1)   
    U.S. Treasury securities are Level 1 assets, but were previously presented in aggregate with U.S. government-sponsored debt securities as Level 2. The Company now presents U.S. Treasury securities separately for disclosure purposes. There were no changes to the valuation techniques or related inputs used to measure fair value. Prior period amounts reflect the change in presentation. 
     Level 1 assets.   Cash equivalents (money market funds), U.S. Treasury securities and equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. 
     89 

     Table of Contents  
  VISA INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  September 30, 2015 

   Level 2 assets.   The fair values of U.S. government-sponsored and corporate debt securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets as provided by third-party pricing vendors. This pricing data is reviewed internally for reasonableness through comparisons with benchmark quotes from independent third-party sources. Based on this review, the valuation is confirmed or revised accordingly. 
  Level 3 assets.   Asset-backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value.  
  There were   no   transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during   fiscal 2015   or   2014  , except for the change in presentation noted above. A separate roll-forward of Level 3 plan assets measured at fair value is not presented because activities during   fiscal 2015   and   2014   were immaterial. 
  Cash Flows 

Other Benefits 
  The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan, or 401(k) plan, that covers substantially all of its employees residing in the United States. Personnel costs included   $49 million  ,   $46 million   and   $44 million   in fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, for expenses attributable to the Company s employees under the 401(k) plan. The Company s contributions to this 401(k) plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred. 
    Note 11 Settlement Guarantee Management    
  The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Settlement at risk, or exposure, is estimated based on the sum of the following inputs: (1) average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin; (2)   four   months of rolling average chargebacks volume; and (3) the total balance for outstanding Visa Travelers Cheques.  
  The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. 
  The Company's settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. The Company's estimated maximum settlement exposure   decreased   to approximately   $43.5 billion   for  
     90 

     Table of Contents  
  VISA INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  September 30, 2015 

   the period ended   September 30, 2015  , compared to   $56.9 billion   for the period ended   September 30, 2014  . The decrease in the Company's estimated maximum settlement exposure for the period ended September 30, 2015 is due to recent changes in the Visa Rules that reduced the number of transactions covered by its settlement indemnification. Of these amounts,   $2.2 billion   and   $3.2 billion   at   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, were covered by collateral. The total available collateral balances presented below were greater than the settlement exposure covered by customer collateral held due to instances in which the available collateral exceeded the total settlement exposure for certain financial institutions at each date presented. 
  The Company maintained collateral as follows: 

Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on the consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in the Company's name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by third parties in trust for the Company and clients. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment.     Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the guarantees.  
  The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients (using, where available, third-party estimates of the probability of customer failure). Historically, the Company experienced minimum losses, which has contributed to an estimated probability-weighted value of the guarantee of approximately   $1 million   and   $2 million   at   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. These amounts were reflected in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.  
    Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments    
  The Company maintains a rolling cash flow hedge program with the objective of reducing exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposures of revenues derived from and payments made in non-functional currencies during the following twelve months. The aggregate notional amounts of the Company's derivative contracts outstanding in its hedge program were   $1.2 billion   at   September 30, 2015   and   2014  . As of   September 30, 2015  , the Company s cash flow hedges in an asset position totaled   $76 million   and were classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet, while cash flow hedges in a liability position totaled   $13 million   and were classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These amounts are subject to master netting agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable positions with the same counterparty, in a single currency through a single payment. However, the Company presents fair values on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets  .   See   Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  .  
  To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods.

   The Company uses regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on the foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Forward points are excluded for effectiveness testing and measurement purposes. The excluded forward points are reported in earnings. For fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the amounts by which earnings were reduced relating to excluded forward points were   $29 million  ,   $27 million   and   $14 million  , respectively. 
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative contracts is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The Company expects to reclassify   $117 million   pre-tax gains to earnings during fiscal 2016. 
  The Company's derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into master netting agreements which require each party to post collateral against its net liability position with the respective counterparty. As of   September 30, 2015  , the Company has received collateral of   $73 million   from counterparties, which is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, and posted collateral of   $4 million  , which is included in other assets. Notwithstanding the Company s efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant at   September 30, 2015  .  
  Additional disclosures that demonstrate how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows have not been presented because the impact of derivative instruments is immaterial to the overall consolidated financial statements. 
    Note 13 Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business    
  The Company s long-lived net property, equipment and technology assets are classified by major geographic areas as follows: 

Revenue by geographic market is primarily based on the location of the issuing financial institution. Revenues earned in the United States were approximately   53%   of total operating revenues in fiscal   2015  , and   54%   in fiscal   2014     and     2013  . No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total operating revenues in these years. 
  A significant portion of Visa s operating revenues is concentrated among its largest clients. Loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. The Company did not have any customer that generated greater than   10%   of its net operating revenues in fiscal   2015  ,   2014   or   2013  . 
    Note 14 Stockholders' Equity    
  Class A common stock split.   In January 2015, Visa s board of directors declared a   four  -for-one split of its class A common stock. Each class A common stockholder of record at the close of business on February 13, 2015 ("Record Date"), received a dividend of three additional shares on March 18, 2015 for every share held as of the Record Date. Trading began on a split-adjusted basis on March 19, 2015. Holders of class B and C common stock did not receive a stock dividend. Instead, the conversion rate for class B common stock increased to   1.6483   shares  
     92

  September 30, 2015 

   of class A common stock per share of class B common stock, and the conversion rate for class C common stock increased to   4.0   shares of class A common stock per share of class C common stock. Immediately following the split, the class A, B and C stockholders retained the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in these unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. As a result of the stock split, all historical per share data and number of shares outstanding presented have been retroactively adjusted. 
  As-converted class A common stock.   The number of shares of each class and the number of shares of class A common stock on an as-converted basis at   September 30, 2015  , are as follows:

    The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. 
     Reduction in as-converted class A common stock.   The following table presents share repurchases in the open market during the following fiscal years:

               (2)   
    Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. 
     In   October 2014  , the Company's board of directors authorized a   $5.0 billion   share repurchase program. As of   September 30, 2015  , the program had remaining authorized funds of   $2.8 billion  . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to   October 2014   have been completed. In   October 2015  , the Company's board of directors authorized an additional   $5.0 billion   share repurchase program. 
  Under the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company makes a deposit into the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. These deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  . 
  The following table presents as-converted class B common stock after deposits into the litigation escrow account in   fiscal 2014  . There were   no   deposits into the litigation escrow account in   fiscal 2015  .

    Effective price per share calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Company's class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Company's current certificate of incorporation.  
     Class B common stock.   The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the U.S. covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the current certificate of incorporation) or similar person or an affiliate of a Visa Member or similar person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer. 
  Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the U.S. covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conversion rate.  
  Class C common stock.   As of   September 30, 2015  , all of the shares of class C common stock have been released from transfer restrictions, and   132 million   shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market. 
  Preferred stock.   Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and it has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Company s assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. The Company had   no   shares of preferred stock outstanding during and at the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, the board of directors authorized the creation of three new series of preferred stock to be issued upon closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. See   Note 2 Visa Europe  .  
  Voting rights.   Holders of class A common stock have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Holders of class B and C common stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including any decision to exit the core payments business and, in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company, in which case the holders of class B and C common stock are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date.  
  Dividends declared.   The Company declared and paid   $1.2 billion   in dividends in   fiscal 2015   at a quarterly rate of   $0.12   per share. In   October 2015  , the Company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.14   per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on   December 1, 2015  , to all holders of record of the Company s class A, B and C common stock as of   November 13, 2015  .

    Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. The number of shares and per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the   four  -for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015. See   Note 14 Stockholders' Equity  . 
               (2)    
    Net income attributable to Visa Inc. is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average numbers of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation were   405 million   for fiscal   2015   and   413 million     for fiscal   2014   and   2013  . The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was   87 million  ,   103 million   and   113 million   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
               (3)    
    Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes   6 million  ,   7 million   and   8 million   common stock equivalents for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, because their effect

   would have been dilutive. The computation excludes   2 million   of common stock equivalents for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
            (4)   
    The outstanding number of shares of class B and C common stock were not impacted by the stock split as these stockholders received an adjustment to their respective conversion ratios instead of stock dividends. See     Note 14 Stockholders' Equity  . Weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding for class B and C common stock are calculated based on the common shares outstanding of each respective class rather than on an as-converted basis. 
               (5)    
    Participating securities are unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company's restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. 
       Note 16 Share-based Compensation    
  2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan 
  The Company s 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, authorizes the compensation committee of the board of directors to grant non-qualified stock options ("options"), restricted stock awards ("RSAs"), restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance-based shares to its employees and non-employee directors, for up to   236 million   shares of class A common stock. Shares available for award may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. The EIP will continue to be in effect until all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is terminated earlier by the Company s board of directors.   No   awards may be granted under the plan on or after   10 years   from its effective date. 
  Share-based compensation cost is recorded net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis for awards with service conditions only, and on a graded-vesting basis for awards with service, performance and market conditions. The Company s estimated forfeiture rate is based on an evaluation of historical, actual and trended forfeiture data. For fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the Company recorded share-based compensation cost of   $184 million  ,   $172 million   and   $179 million  , respectively, in personnel on its consolidated statements of operations. The related tax benefits were   $54 million  ,   $51 million   and   $53 million   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation cost was immaterial during fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . 
  All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding presented below reflect the   four  -for-one stock split that was effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. See   Note 14 Stockholders' Equity  . 
  Options 
  Options issued under the EIP expire   10 years   from the date of grant and primarily vest ratably over   3 years   from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. 
  During fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 

(1)   
    Beginning in fiscal 2014, assumption is based on the Company's historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. The Company's data is weighted based on the number of years between the measurement date and Visa's initial public offering as a percentage of the options' contractual term. The relative weighting placed on Visa's data and peer data in fiscal 2015 was  
        96 

     Table of Contents  
  VISA INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  September 30, 2015 

   approximately   67%   and   33%  , respectively, and the relative weighting in fiscal 2014 was   58%   and   42%  , respectively. In fiscal 2013, assumption was fully based on peer companies' data. 
            (2)   
    Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards. 
               (3)   
    Based on the Company s implied and historical volatility. The expected volatilities ranged from   21%   to   23%   in fiscal   2015  . In fiscal 2013, historical volatility was a blend of Visa's historical volatility and those of comparable peer companies. The relative weighting between Visa historical volatility and the historical volatility of the peer companies was based on the percentage of years Visa stock price information is available since its initial public offering compared to the expected term.  
               (4)   
    Based on the Company s annual dividend rate on the date of grant. 
     The following table summarizes the Company s option activity for fiscal   2015  :   

            (1)   
    Calculated using the closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal   2015   of   $69.66  , less the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of instruments.  
               (2)   
    Applies a forfeiture rate to unvested options outstanding at September 30,   2015   to estimate the options expected to vest in the future. 
     For the options exercised during fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the total intrinsic value was   $134 million  ,   $187 million   and   $176 million  , respectively, and the tax benefit realized was   $86 million  ,   $65 million   and   $59 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2015  , there was   $17 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   1.4   years. 
  Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units 
  RSAs and RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over   3 years   from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. 
  Upon vesting, the RSAs are settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the vesting period, RSA award recipients are eligible to receive dividends and participate in the same voting rights as those granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Company s option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents, but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. 
  The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSAs and RSUs is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs granted during fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   was   $63.71  ,   $49.98   and   $36.80  , respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   was   $62.88  ,   $49.44   and   $36.55  , respectively. The total grant-date fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   was   $132 million  ,   $126 million   and   $98 million  , respectively.

   The following table summarizes the Company's RSA and RSU activity for fiscal   2015  :   

            (1)   
    Calculated by multiplying the closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal   2015   of   $69.66   by the number of instruments. 
     At   September 30, 2015  , there was   $138 million   and   $38 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSAs and RSUs, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   1.5   years for RSAs and   1.4   years for RSUs. 
  Performance-based Shares 
  The following table summarizes the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned and related activity for fiscal   2015  :   

            (1)   
    Calculated by multiplying the closing stock price on the last trading day of   fiscal 2015   of   $69.66   by the number of instruments. 
               (2)   
    Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned. 
     For the Company's performance-based shares, in addition to service conditions, the ultimate number of shares to be earned depends on the achievement of both performance and market conditions. The performance condition is based on the Company's earnings per share target. The market condition is based on the Company's total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the Standard   Poor's 500 Index. The fair value of the performance-based shares, incorporating the market condition, is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant-date fair value of performance-based shares granted in fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   was   $69.78  ,   $56.37   and   $41.04   per share, respectively. Earned performance shares granted in fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   vest approximately   3 years   from the initial grant date. All performance awards are subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions.  
  Compensation cost for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance. It is recorded net of estimated forfeitures and adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period. At   September 30, 2015  , there was   $11 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested

   performance-based shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   0.7   years. 
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan  
  In January 2015, the Company's class A stockholders approved the Visa Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ), under which substantially all employees are eligible to participate. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase the Company s class A common stock at a   15%   discount of the stock price on the purchase date, subject to certain restrictions. A total of   20 million   shares of class A common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The first offering date was April 1, 2015. The ESPP does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
    Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies 
  Commitments.   The Company leases certain premises and equipment throughout the world with varying expiration dates. The Company incurred total rent expense of   $136 million  ,   $134 million   and   $94 million   in fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Future minimum payments on leases, and marketing and sponsorship agreements per fiscal year, at   September 30, 2015  , are as follows:    

  Select sponsorship agreements require the Company to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For commitments where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to the fixed payments stated above, select sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly higher than the actual costs incurred by the Company. 
  Client incentives.   The Company has agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions. These agreements, with terms ranging from   one   to   thirteen   years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to encourage client business and to increase overall Visa-branded payment and transaction volume, thereby reducing per-unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa clients. 
  Payments made that qualify for capitalization, and obligations incurred under these programs are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. Client incentives are recognized primarily as a reduction to operating revenue in the period the related volumes and transactions occur, based on management's estimate of the client's performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of client incentive payments.  
  The table below sets forth the expected future reduction of revenue per fiscal year for client incentive agreements in effect at   September 30, 2015  :    

The amount of client incentives recorded as a reduction of revenue in future periods under the Company's incentive arrangements, will be greater or less than the estimates above due to changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

   on these agreements, increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed the above estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
    Note 18 Related Parties    
  Visa considers an entity to be a related party for purposes of this disclosure if that entity owns more than   10%   of Visa s total voting common stock at the end of the fiscal year, or if an officer or employee of that entity also serves on the Company's board of directors. The Company considers an investee to be a related party if the Company s: (i) ownership interest in the investee is greater than or equal to   10%   or (ii) if the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. At   September 30, 2015   and   2014  ,   no   entity owned more than   10%   of the Company s total voting common stock. There were   no   significant transactions with related parties during fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . 
    Note 19 Income Taxes    
  The Company s income before taxes by fiscal year consisted of the following: 

U.S. income before taxes included   $2.4 billion  ,   $2.3 billion   and   $2.0 billion   of the Company's U.S. entities' income from operations outside of the U.S. for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.

   The tax effect of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , are presented below: 

Total net deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the Company s consolidated balance sheets as follows:   

            (1)   
    Non-current deferred tax assets are reflected in other assets and current deferred tax liabilities are reflected in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
     In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The fiscal   2015   and   2014   valuation allowances relate primarily to foreign net operating losses from subsidiaries acquired in recent years.    
  As of   September 30, 2015  , the Company had   $30 million   federal,   $19 million   state and   $177 million   foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in    fiscal 2028 through 2035   . The foreign net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company expects to fully utilize the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in future years.

   The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   to pretax income, as a result of the following: 

The effective income tax rates were   30%   in fiscal   2015   and   2014  . The following highlights the significant tax items recorded in each respective year: 
             
    a   $296 million   tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Included in the   $296 million   is a one-time   $239 million   tax benefit that relates to prior fiscal years; and 
                
    a   $264 million   tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2014 related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which   $191 million   was a one-time tax benefit related to prior fiscal years. 
     The effective income tax rate of   30%   in fiscal   2014   differs from the effective income tax rate of   31%   in fiscal   2013   mainly due to: 
               
    a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; and  
                
    certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013.     
     Current income taxes receivable were   $77 million   and   $91 million   at   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Non-current income taxes receivable of   $627 million   and $597 million were included in other assets at   September 30, 2015   and 2014, respectively. See   Note 5 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets  . At   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , income taxes payable of   $75 million   and   $73 million  , respectively, were included in accrued income taxes as part of accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes of   $752 million   and   $855 million  , respectively, were included in other long-term liabilities. See   Note 8 Accrued and Other Liabilities  . 
  Cumulative undistributed earnings of the Company s international subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States amounted to   $6.4 billion   at   September 30, 2015  . The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. 
  The Company s largest operating hub outside the United States is located in Singapore. It operates under a tax incentive agreement which is effective through September 30, 2023, and is conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds in Singapore. The tax incentive agreement decreased Singapore tax by   $192 million  ,   $168 million   and   $158 million  , and the benefit of the tax incentive agreement on diluted earnings per share was   $0.08  ,   $0.07   and   $0.06   in fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  
  In accordance with   Accounting Standards Codification 740 Income Taxes  , the Company is required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record

   liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. 
  At   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company s total gross unrecognized tax benefits were   $1.1 billion   and   $1.3 billion  , respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties described below. Included in the   $1.1 billion   and   $1.3 billion   are   $859 million   and   $1.1 billion   of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period. 
  A reconciliation of beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits by fiscal year is as follows:    

It is the Company s policy to account for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating expense in its consolidated statements of operations. The Company reversed   $6 million   of interest expense in fiscal 2015 and recognized   $10 million   and   $9 million   of interest expense in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. The Company accrued   $1 million   and   $2 million   of penalties in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, and reversed   $4 million   of penalties in fiscal 2013, related to uncertain tax positions. At   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company had accrued interest of   $33 million   and   $39 million  , respectively, and accrued penalties of   $6 million   and   $5 million  , respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in its other long-term liabilities.    
  The Company's fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") examination. The Company has filed a federal refund claim for fiscal year 2008, which is also currently under IRS examination. Except for the refund claim, the federal statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2009. The Company's fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 California tax returns are currently under examination. Except for certain outstanding refund claims, the California statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2006.  
  During fiscal 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency ("CRA") completed its examination of the Company's fiscal 2003 through 2009 Canadian tax returns and proposed certain assessments. Based on the findings of its examination, the CRA also proposed certain assessments to the Company's fiscal 2010 through 2014 Canadian tax returns. The Company filed notices of objection against these assessments and, in fiscal 2015, completed the appeals process without reaching a settlement with the CRA. The Company intends to petition the Tax Court of Canada to overturn the CRA's assessments, and continues to believe that its income tax provision adequately reflects its obligations to the CRA. 
  The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the federal, state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impact that the final outcomes could have on the Company's unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.

   Note 20 Legal Matters 
  The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. 
  The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management's understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. 
  The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation.   

  U.S. Covered Litigation 
  Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  .   An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The following table summarizes the activity related to U.S. covered litigation.   

  On January 14, 2014, the MDL 1720 court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings, which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals. Following the payment of approximately   $4.0 billion   from the litigation escrow account into settlement funds pursuant to the class settlement agreement, on January 27, 2014, Visa received and deposited into the Company's litigation escrow account "takedown payments" of approximately   $1.1 billion  , which Visa was entitled to receive under the class settlement agreement based on payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who opted out. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and a related increase in accrued litigation to address opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. An additional accrual of   $450 million   associated with  
     104 

       Table of Contents  
  VISA INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  September 30, 2015 

   these opt-out claims was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Payments totaling   $57 million     and     $426 million   were made in fiscal 2014 and 2015, respectively, from the litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with a number of individual opt-out merchants, resulting in an accrued balance of   $1.0 billion   related to U.S. covered litigation as of September 30, 2015. See further discussion below under   Interchange Opt-out Litigation   and   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  . 
    Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) 
  Beginning in May 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed in U.S. federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and/or MasterCard, and in some cases, certain Visa member financial institutions. The complaints challenged, among other things, Visa's and MasterCard's purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their "no surcharge" rules, and alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees under the federal antitrust laws, and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiffs subsequently filed a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint which, together with the complaints brought by individual merchants, sought money damages alleged to range in the tens of billions of dollars (subject to trebling), as well as attorneys' fees and injunctive relief. The class plaintiffs also filed a Second Supplemental Class Action Complaint against Visa Inc. and certain member financial institutions challenging Visa's reorganization and IPO under the antitrust laws and seeking unspecified money damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order that the IPO be unwound. 
  The Company and the individual merchants whose claims were consolidated with the MDL (the "Individual Plaintiffs") signed a settlement agreement to resolve the Individual Plaintiffs' claims against the Company for approximately   $350 million  . This payment was made from the litigation escrow account on October 29, 2012, and the court has dismissed those claims with prejudice. 
  In addition, Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims. The terms of the Settlement Agreement include, among other terms: 
             
    A comprehensive release from participating class members for liability arising out of claims asserted in the litigation, and a further release to protect against future litigation regarding default interchange and the other U.S. rules at issue in the MDL; 
                
    Settlement payments from the Company of approximately   $4.0 billion  ; 
                
    Distribution to class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months, which otherwise would have been paid to issuers and which effectively reduces credit interchange for that period of time; 
                
    Certain modifications to the Company's rules, including modifications to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances, subject to a cap and a level playing field with other general purpose card competitors; and 
                
    Agreement that the Company will meet with merchant buying groups that seek to negotiate interchange rates collectively. 
     On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately   $4.0 billion   from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. 
  On January 14, 2014, the court entered a final judgment order approving the settlement, from which a number of objectors have appealed. Until the appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard argument in the objectors' appeals on September 28, 2015.

  September 30, 2015 

   On January 14, 2015, following a court-approved process to give class members who previously opted out of the damages portion of the class settlement an option to rejoin it, the class administrator reported that it had received   1,179   requests by merchants to rejoin the cash settlement class, some of which may include multiple merchants. 
  On July 28, 2015, certain objectors to the class settlement asked the court to vacate or set aside its final judgment approving the settlement, or in the alternative, to grant further discovery, in light of communications between one of MasterCard's former lawyers and one of the lawyers for the class plaintiffs. 
  Consumer Interchange Litigation 
  On December 16, 2013, a putative class action was filed on behalf of all Visa and MasterCard payment cardholders in the United States since January 1, 2000 against certain financial institutions, identifying non-defendants Visa, MasterCard, and certain other financial institutions as co-conspirators. Plaintiffs allege primarily a conspiracy to fix interchange fees and seek injunctive relief, attorneys  fees, and treble damages in excess of   $54.0 billion   dollars annually arising from purported overcharges. Originally filed in federal court in California, the case was transferred to MDL 1720. On November 26, 2014, the MDL court dismissed plaintiffs' federal law claim and declined to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiffs' state law claim. Both sides have asked the court to reconsider aspects of its decision and have filed notices of appeal. 
  Interchange Opt-out Litigation 
  Beginning in May 2013, more than   50   opt-out cases have been filed by hundreds of merchants in various federal district courts, generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. A number of the cases also include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments, and one of the cases seeks an injunction against the fixed acquirer network fee. The cases name as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, and MasterCard International Incorporated, although some also include certain U.S. financial institutions as defendants. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its subsidiaries filed an opt-out complaint that also adds Visa Europe Limited and Visa Europe Services Inc. as defendants. Visa has acknowledged and confirmed its obligations to indemnify Visa Europe Limited and Visa Europe Services Inc. with respect to the claim against them in Wal-Mart s complaint. 
  Visa, MasterCard, and certain U.S. financial institution defendants in MDL 1720 filed a complaint in the Eastern District of New York against certain named class representative plaintiffs who had opted out or stated their intention to opt out of the damages portion of the Settlement Agreement. In addition, Visa filed   three   more similar complaints in the Eastern District of New York against Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; against The Home Depot, Inc. and Home Depot U.S.A.; and against Sears Holdings Corporation. All   four   complaints seek a declaration that, from January 1, 2004 to November 27, 2012, the time period for which opt-outs may seek damages under the Settlement Agreement, Visa's conduct in, among other things, continuing to set default interchange rates, maintaining its "honor all cards" rule, enforcing certain rules relating to merchants, and restructuring itself, did not violate federal or state antitrust laws.  
  All the cases filed in federal court have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, or have been or expect to be transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. The court has entered an order confirming that   In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation  , 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.), includes (1) all current and future actions transferred to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceedings, and (2) all actions filed in the Eastern District of New York that arise out of operative facts as alleged in the cases subject to the transfer orders of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Cases that are transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720 are U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  . 
  Visa has reached a settlement agreement with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its subsidiaries, which will terminate if, following all appeals, the MDL class settlement is reversed or vacated with respect to certification of the Rule        23(b)(2) settlement class or the consideration provided to or release provided by that class. Including this settlement

  September 30, 2015 

   with Wal-Mart, as of the date of filing, Visa has reached settlement agreements with a number of merchants representing approximately   48%   of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out.  
  On December 23, 2014, a similar case was filed in New Mexico state court by New Mexico's attorney general on behalf of the state, state agencies, and citizens of the state, generally pursuing claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. On May 15, 2015, defendants filed a partial motion to dismiss, which was granted in part and, among other things, narrowed the state antitrust damages claims.  
  While the Company believes that it has substantial defenses in these matters, the final outcome of individual legal claims is inherently unpredictable. The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of individual opt-out claims, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. 
  European Competition Proceedings 
  European Commission.   Following the European Commission's ("EC") issuance in 2009 of a Statement of Objections, the EC announced a supplementary Statement of Objections ("SSO") on July 31, 2012, concerning interchange for consumer credit card transactions; and, on March 8, 2013, a redacted version of the SSO was served on Visa Inc. and Visa International. The SSO alleges a breach of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. Among other things, the SSO asserts claims jointly against Visa Europe, Visa Inc., and Visa International, objecting to domestic, cross-border, and inter-regional interchange, and Visa Europe's cross-border acquiring and point of sale rules. The SSO also announces the EC's intention to impose fines. The potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. 
  On February 26, 2014, the EC adopted a formal decision accepting Visa Europe s commitments addressing domestic interchange, cross-border interchange for credit card transactions within Europe, and cross-border acquiring within Europe, and made the commitments legally binding on Visa Europe. The EC continues the proceedings in respect of inter-regional interchange fees that apply to transactions involving a Visa credit cardholder from outside the Visa Europe territory and a merchant in the European Economic Area (EEA). These interchange fees are set by Visa Inc. 
  U.K. Merchant Litigation  . Since July 2013, approximately   20   merchants (together with subsidiary/affiliate companies) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe (used in this   U.K. Merchant Litigation   section to denote Visa Europe Limited and/or relevant subsidiary/affiliate companies), Visa Inc. and Visa International relating to interchange rates in Europe, and seek damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct primarily in relation to U.K. domestic and/or Irish domestic and/or intra-EEA interchange fees for credit and debit cards. After a successful application for summary judgment in the High Court (Commercial Court) and an unsuccessful appeal by the claimants, the claims of U.K. merchants should be limited to the six year period immediately preceding the issuance of each claim. 
  In addition, since March 2013, in excess of   20   additional merchants (together with subsidiary/affiliate companies) have threatened to commence proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc., and Visa International with respect to interchange rates in Europe. Visa Europe, Visa Inc., and Visa International entered into standstill agreements with respect to some of those merchants  claims. While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, these claims have not yet been filed and their full scope is not yet known. 
  Altogether, therefore, merchants accounting for more than   50%   of U.K. retail sales have either filed claims or preserved their right to do so. The amount of interchange being challenged is substantial. Although not all of the merchant claims have been served and thus the full scope of the claims is not yet known, and there are substantial defenses to these claims, the total damages sought in the claims that have been served amount to several billion dollars.  
  The Company has learned that several additional European merchants have indicated that they may bring claims against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and/or Visa International with respect to interchange rates in Europe. We anticipate that similar claims may be asserted by additional merchants in the future.

   In our view, pursuant to the parties' agreements, Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. and Visa International in connection with the European Competition Proceeding and the U.K. Merchant Litigation, including payment of any fines or damages that may be imposed. However, Visa Europe has informed Visa Inc. of its view that it is not obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. or Visa International for these claims. The parties have initiated the executive engagement aspect of the dispute resolution procedure contemplated by the Framework Agreement to resolve this dispute. If the acquisition of Visa Europe is not completed, this dispute may continue. However, if the acquisition is completed, Visa Europe will become wholly owned by Visa Inc. In these circumstances, Visa Inc.'s protection in respect of losses suffered pursuant to the claims which are covered by the transaction protections described in   Note 2 Visa Europe   and   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities   will be pursuant to the terms of the preferred stock and/or the U.K. loss sharing agreement. If claims are not covered by these transactional protections, Visa Europe may have recourse under its membership documents against members under the terms of the existing indemnity arrangements (other than in respect of certain claims relating to U.K. domestic multilateral interchange fees). 
  Other Litigation 
  "Indirect Purchaser" Actions 
  From 2000 to 2004, complaints were filed on behalf of consumers in   nineteen   different states and the District of Columbia against Visa and MasterCard. The complaints alleged, among other things, that Visa's "honor all cards" rule and a similar MasterCard rule violated state antitrust and consumer protection laws, and common law. The claims in these class actions asserted that merchants, faced with excessive merchant discount fees, passed on some portion of those fees to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold. Plaintiffs sought money damages and injunctive relief. Visa has been successful in the majority of these cases, and has resolved the cases in all jurisdictions but California.  
  In California, the consolidated   Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases   were resolved pursuant to a revised settlement agreement that received final approval and was affirmed on appeal. Certain objectors filed petitions for rehearing and for review by the California Supreme Court that were denied on February 11, 2015, and the judgment approving the settlement agreement is now final. One objector has appealed the trial court's orders regarding the distribution of certain settlement funds, and the denial of that objector's motion for attorneys' fees and costs. 
  Canadian Competition Proceedings 
  Merchant Litigation  . Beginning in December 2010, a number of putative class action lawsuits were filed in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta against Visa Canada, MasterCard, and   ten   financial institutions on behalf of purported classes of merchants and others that accept payment by Visa and MasterCard. In Saskatchewan, a separate action was filed against Visa Canada Corporation and Visa Inc.,   two   MasterCard entities, and a number of smaller Canadian issuing banks that are not named as defendants in any of the existing proceedings. The lawsuits allege a violation of Section 45 of Canada's Competition Act and assert claims of civil conspiracy, interference with economic interests, and unjust enrichment, among others. Plaintiffs allege that Visa and MasterCard each conspired with their member financial institutions to set supra-competitive default interchange rates and merchant discount fees, and that Visa and MasterCard's respective "no-surcharge" and "honor all cards" policies had the anticompetitive effect of increasing merchant discount fees. Three of the named financial institutions, which are not significant Canadian issuers, have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs, subject to court approval. 
  On March 26, 2014, the British Columbia Supreme Court, in   Watson v. Bank of America Corporation, et al.  , granted the plaintiffs' application for class certification in part, allowing plaintiffs to proceed as a class on claims for price fixing under Canada's Competition Act, among other claims. On appeal by both plaintiff and defendants, the British Columbia Court of Appeal permitted the class to proceed with its price-fixing and other claims, while striking out certain claims and ordering reconsideration of certification as it relates to one of the bank defendants. The lawsuits in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan are effectively stayed pending further proceedings in the British Columbia lawsuit. 
   The pending Canada Merchant Litigation lawsuits largely seek unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief, but some allege substantial damages.

   Dynamic Currency Conversion 
  On February 4, 2013, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("ACCC") commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against several Visa entities asserting violations of Australian competition law based on allegations of restrictions on dynamic currency conversion (DCC) services on Visa international payment card transactions at certain Australian merchant outlets from May 2010 to October 2010, and on DCC services on cash withdrawals using Visa international payment cards at Australian ATMs. 
  The parties reached an agreement to resolve the proceedings. Pursuant to the settlement, on September 4, 2015, the court ordered Visa to pay a pecuniary penalty of AUD  $18 million   and costs of AUD  $2 million   based on a single contravention of section 47(2) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) for conduct concerning certain Australian merchant outlets from May to October 2010. The court dismissed all other claims asserted by the ACCC. 
  Data Pass Litigation 
  On November 19, 2010, a consumer filed an amended class action complaint against Webloyalty.com, Inc., Gamestop Corporation, and Visa Inc. in Connecticut federal district court, seeking damages, restitution, and injunctive relief on the grounds that consumers who made online purchases at merchants were allegedly deceived into incurring charges for services from Webloyalty.com through the unauthorized passing of cardholder account information during the sales transaction ("data pass"), in violation of federal and state consumer protection statutes and common law. On October 15, 2015, the court dismissed the case in its entirety, without leave to replead. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on November 12, 2015. 
  U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation 
  National ATM Council Class Action  . On October 12, 2011, the National ATM Council and   thirteen   non-bank ATM operators filed a purported class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A., and Plus System, Inc.) and MasterCard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges Visa's rule (and a similar MasterCard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on other networks. Plaintiffs claim that the rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seek damages "in an amount not presently known, but which is tens of millions of dollars, prior to trebling," injunctive relief, and attorneys  fees. Plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint against the same defendants, also asserting that the ATM access fee rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs request treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees.  
  Consumer Class Actions  . In October 2011, a purported consumer class action was filed against Visa and MasterCard in the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. Two other purported consumer class actions challenging the rules, later combined, were also filed in October 2011 in the same federal court naming Visa, MasterCard and   three   financial institutions as defendants. These putative class actions seek treble damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees where available under federal and state law, including under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and consumer protection statutes. 
  On February 13, 2013, the court granted the defendants  motions to dismiss and dismissed all of these cases without prejudice, and later denied plaintiffs  motions for leave to amend and to alter the court's judgment. On plaintiffs' appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the lower court's decisions and remanded for further proceedings. On September 3, 2015, defendants filed a petition seeking panel rehearing or rehearing en banc before the appellate court, which was denied on September 28, 2015. 
  U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand 
  On March 13, 2012, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the   "  Division  "  ) issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or   "  CID,  "   to Visa Inc. seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.    1, 2. The CID focuses on PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa's competitive responses to the Dodd-Frank Act, including Visa's fixed acquirer network fee. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the CID.

   Federal Trade Commission Voluntary Access Letter 
  On September 21, 2012, the Bureau of Competition of the United States Federal Trade Commission (the   "  Bureau  "  ) requested that Visa provide on a voluntary basis documents and information regarding potential violations of certain regulations associated with the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly Section 920(b)(1)(B) of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693o-2, and Regulation II, 12 C.F.R.   235.7(b) (commonly known as the  Durbin Amendment  and regulations). The request focuses on information related to the purposes, implementation, and impact of the optional PIN Debit Gateway Service. The revenue generated by the PIN Debit Gateway Service is not material to the Company s financial statements. Visa is cooperating with the Bureau and responding to its information requests. 
  Pulse Network 
  On November 25, 2014, Pulse Network LLC filed suit against Visa Inc. in federal district court in Texas. Pulse alleges that Visa has monopolized and attempted to monopolize debit card network services markets. Pulse also alleges that Visa has entered into agreements in restraint of trade, engaged in unlawful exclusive dealing and tying, violated the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act, and engaged in tortious interference with prospective business relationships. Pulse seeks unspecified treble damages, attorneys' fees, and injunctive relief, including to enjoin the fixed acquirer network fee structure, Visa's conduct regarding PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit, and Visa agreements with merchants and acquirers relating to debit acceptance. On January 23, 2015, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. 
    Note 21 Subsequent Events

    Controls and Procedures 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of   September 30, 2015  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level. 
  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. 
  Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2015  . Based on management s assessment, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of   September 30, 2015   using the criteria set forth in Internal Control     Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). 
  Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks discussed in   Item 1A Risk Factors   of this report. 
  The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2015  , has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in   Item 8   of this report.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  In preparation for management s report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal   2015  , there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended   September 30, 2015  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

In no event shall (i) the fact that the Board has specified the consideration of nominees for directors in its notice of meeting be sufficient to give notice of any nomination or comply with the notice requirements of these By-Laws relating to stockholder notice with respect to any stockholder nominee, unless such nominee is specifically named in the notice of meeting circulated by the Corporation and, if applicable, the requirements of   Section 2.17   have been met, or (ii) an adjournment, rescheduling, recess or postponement of an annual meeting, or the public disclosure thereof, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder notice. 
  (c)        For purposes of this   Section 2.3  ,   Section 2.4  ,   Section 2.5  , and   Section 2.17  ,    public disclosure    shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service, in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the    SEC   ) pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the    Exchange Act   ), by posting on the Corporation s website, or by other means designed to result in broad public distribution of information. 

(d)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, any stockholder seeking to bring any nomination for election as a director or other business before any annual meeting must comply with the requirements of   Section 2.5   and   Section 2.6     whether or not such stockholder intends to request inclusion of such proposal in any proxy materials to be distributed by the Corporation. 
  Section 2.4        Special Meetings of Stockholders  . 
  (a)        Subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock of the Corporation, special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation, for any purpose or purposes, may be called only by or at the direction of the Board, the Chairperson of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.  Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.   
  (b)        Unless otherwise required by law, notice of a special meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) calendar days before the date of the meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. 
  (c)        Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (i) by or at the direction of the Board or (ii)   provided   that the Board has specified in its notice of meeting that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who provides a timely stockholder notice to the Secretary of the Corporation that complies with the notice procedures set forth in   Section 2.5  .  In no event shall (i) the fact that the Board has specified the consideration of nominees for directors in its notice of meeting be sufficient to give notice of any nomination or comply with the notice requirements of these By-Laws relating to stockholder notice with respect to any stockholder nominee, unless such nominee is specifically named in the notice of meeting circulated by the Corporation, or (ii) an adjournment, rescheduling, recess or postponement of a special meeting, or the public disclosure thereof, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder notice as described in   Section 2.5   and   Section 2.6  .

  Section 2.5        Stockholder Notice Requirements  . 
  (a)        At any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, (i) nominations for the election of directors and (ii) business to be brought before any such stockholders  meeting may only be made or proposed (a) pursuant to the Corporation s notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in this By-Law, who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in these By-Laws of the Corporation (the    By-Laws   ). 

(b)        Any stockholder may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a stockholders  meeting or propose business to be brought before a stockholders  meeting, or both, pursuant to   Section 2.5(a)   of these By-Laws, only if the stockholder has given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the stockholders  meeting; provided, however, that if less than one hundred (100) days  notice or other prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to the stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be received no later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the earlier of the day on which notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or other public disclosure was made.

  (j)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   Section 2.17  , the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any Stockholder Nominee, and such nomination shall be disregarded and no vote on such Stockholder Nominee will occur, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation, if:  
  (i)        the Eligible Stockholder or Stockholder Nominee breaches any of its respective agreements, representations, or warranties set forth in the Stockholder Notice (or otherwise submitted pursuant to this   Section 2.17  ), any of the information in the Stockholder Notice (or otherwise submitted pursuant to this   Section 2.17  ) was not, when provided, true, correct and complete, or the requirements of this   Section 2.17   have otherwise not been met;

  (iv)        the election of the Stockholder Nominee to the Board would cause the Corporation to violate the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, these By-Laws, any applicable law, rule, regulation or listing standard. 
  (k)        The maximum number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by all Eligible Stockholders that may be included in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this   Section  

2.17  , shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Stockholder Notice may be delivered pursuant to this   Section 2.17   with respect to the annual meeting, or if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number (rounding down) below twenty percent (20%) (such resulting number, the    Permitted Number      provided   that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by (i) any Stockholder Nominee whose name was submitted for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this   Section 2.17   but who the Board decides to nominate as a Board nominee, (ii) any directors in office or director candidates that in either case will be included in the Corporation s proxy materials with respect to such an annual meeting as an unopposed (by the Corporation) nominee pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or other understanding between the Corporation and a stockholder or group of stockholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of stock, by such stockholder or group of stockholders, from the Corporation), and (iii) any nominees who were previously elected to the Board as Stockholder Nominees at any of the preceding two annual meetings and who are nominated for election at such annual meeting by the Board as a Board nominee.      In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs after the date of the Stockholder Notice but before the annual meeting and the Board resolves to reduce the size of the Board in connection therewith, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this   Section 2.17   exceeds the Permitted Number, the Corporation shall determine which Stockholder Nominees shall be included in the Corporation s proxy materials in accordance with the following provisions:  each Eligible Stockholder will select one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the Corporation each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as Owned in its respective Stockholder Notice submitted to the Corporation.  If the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Stockholder has selected one Stockholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached.  Following such determination, if any Stockholder Nominee who satisfies the eligibility requirements in this   Section 2.17   thereafter is nominated by the Board, thereafter is not included in the Corporation s proxy materials or thereafter is not submitted for director election for any reason (including the Eligible Stockholder s or Stockholder Nominee s failure to comply with this   Section 2.17  ), no other nominee or nominees shall be included in the Corporation s proxy materials or otherwise submitted for director election in substitution thereof. 
  (l)        Any Stockholder Nominee who is included in the Corporation s proxy materials for a particular annual meeting of stockholders but either (i) withdraws from or becomes ineligible or unavailable for election at the annual meeting for any reason, including for the failure to comply with any provision of these By-Laws (  provided   that in no event shall any such withdrawal, ineligibility or unavailability commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Stockholder Notice) or (ii) does not receive a number of votes cast in favor of his or her election at least equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote in the election of directors, will be ineligible to be a Stockholder Nominee pursuant to this   Section 2.17   for the next two annual meetings.    

(m)        The Board (and any other person or body authorized by the Board) shall have the power and authority to interpret this   Section 2.17   and to make any and all determinations necessary or advisable to apply this   Section 2.17   to any persons, facts or circumstances, including the power to determine (i) whether one or more stockholders or beneficial owners qualifies as an Eligible Stockholder, (ii) whether a Stockholder Notice complies with this   Section 2.17  , (iii) whether a Stockholder Nominee satisfies the qualifications and requirements in this   Section 2.17  , and (iv) whether any and all requirements of this   Section 2.17   have been satisfied.  Any such interpretation or determination adopted in good faith by the Board (or any other person or body authorized by the Board) shall be binding on all persons, including the Corporation and its stockholders (including any beneficial owners).      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.17  , unless otherwise required by law or otherwise determined by the chairperson of the meeting or the Board, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder as defined in   Section 2.5(a)  )   does not appear at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present its Stockholder Nominee or Stockholder Nominees, such nomination or nominations shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of the election of the Stockholder Nominee or Stockholder Nominees may have been received by the Corporation.  For purposes of this   Section 2.17(m)  , a  qualified representative  of a stockholder shall mean a person who is a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder (or a reliable reproduction or electronic transmission in writing) delivered to the Corporation prior to the making of a nomination at a meeting by such stockholder stating that such person is authorized to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders.

When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 
  Section 6.3        Transfer of Stock  .  Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate representing shares of stock duly endorsed or accompanied by    

proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.

Whenever any transfer of shares of capital stock shall be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed in the entry of the transfer if, when the certificates are presented to the Corporation for transfer or uncertified shares are requested to be transferred, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation do so.

  (b)        Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for such other purposes as the directors shall think conducive to the interest of the Corporation, and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.

Section 7.3        Checks  .  Except as otherwise provided herein, the Board shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the Corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.

  any reason other than death on or after the Participant's Retirement Eligibility Date.

For all other employees it shall mean, the earlier of (x) the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the employee attains age 55 with 10 Years of Service and (y) first day of the month coincident with or next following Participant s 65   th    birthday.    
   1.31      "Separation from Service"   shall occur if a Participant dies, retires or otherwise has

A Participant will not incur a Separation from Service while he is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six months, or if longer, so long as the individual retains a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or contract. A leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the Participant will return to perform services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, where such impairment causes the Participant to be unable to perform the duties of his position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, a 29 month period of absence is substituted for such six month period. 
  A Participant incurs a "termination of employment" on the date it is reasonably anticipated based on the facts and circumstances that he will perform no further services after that date or that the level of bona fide services he would perform after that date (whether as an Employee or an independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an Employee or an independent contractor) over the immediately preceding 36 month period (or the full period of services if the Participant has been providing services for less than 36 months). For periods during which a Participant is on a paid bona fide leave of absence as described in the immediately preceding paragraph, he is treated as providing bona fide services at a level equal to the level of services that he would have been required to perform to receive the compensation paid with respect to such leave of absence. Periods during which a Participant is on an unpaid bona fide leave of absence as described in the immediately preceding paragraph are disregarded for purposes of determining whether a Participant has incurred a termination of employment. 
  1.32     Termination Benefit  shall mean the benefit described in Article 7. 
    
  1.33       "Trust"   or   "Trust Agreement"     shall mean the Visa Deferred Compensation Plan Trust 
  Agreement, as amended from time to time, entered into between the Company and the Trustee in connection with the Plan. 
  1.34     Trustee  shall mean the trustee under the Trust 
  1.35      "Unforeseeable Financial Emergency"   shall mean a severe financial hardship to the 
  Participant resulting from illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant's spouse or a dependent (as defined in section 152(a) of the Code without regard to sections 152(b)(1), (b)(2) and (d)(1)(B) of the Code) of the Participant, loss of the Participant's property due to casualty (including the need to rebuild a home following damage to a home not otherwise covered by insurance) or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. 
  1.36      "Visa Deferred Compensation Plan"   shall mean the deferred compensation plan 
  consisting of two components, the Plan and the Pre-2005 Plan. 
    
  1.37       Years of Service    shall mean Eligibility Service, as defined in the Visa Retirement Plan and determined in accordance with Section 5.1 thereof (which means, without limitation, disregarding any Eligibility Service that may be credited by reason of status as a leased employee or an employee misclassified as an independent contractor or such a leased employee for tax purposes before he became a participant in the Visa Retirement Plan) and determined without regard to Paragraph 14.11 of the Pre-2002 Plan component or Paragraph 13.11 of the 2002 Plan component of the Visa Retirement Plan, as applicable). 
  ARTICLE 2 
  ELECTION, ENROLLMENT, COMMENCEMENT, TERMINATION 
  2.1      Eligibility.   Participation in the Plan shall be limited to Employees who are designated by 
  the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or the Committee as being eligible to defer compensation under the Plan, provided that such eligibility is consistent with the Plan's intended purpose of providing an opportunity to defer the receipt of compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA as the Committee shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion. 
  2.2      Election Requirements.   As described in Section 3.2, an election to participate in the Plan 
  shall specify: (i) the type of compensation to be deferred; (ii) the amount of such compensation to be deferred; and (iii) the date and form that such deferred compensation is to be paid. 
  2.3      Commencement of Participation.   Provided an Employee selected to participate in the 
  Plan has met all election requirements within 30 days of notification of his initial eligibility to participate in the Plan and other nonqualified deferred compensation plans treated as a single plan with this Plan under section 409A of the Code, that individual shall commence participation in the Plan upon the timely completion of those requirements. If an individual's initial election to defer compensation pursuant to Section 3.2 is not received within the required 30 day period, that individual shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan until the first day of the Plan Year following the date such election requirements are first met. 
  2.4      Termination of Participation and/or Deferrals.   If the Committee determines in good faith 
  that a Participant no longer meets the requirement of Section 2.1 hereof, the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to prevent the Participant from making deferral elections for future Plan Years. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, reinstate the Participant to full Plan participation at such time in the future as the Participant again meets the requirements of Section 2.1. 
    
  ARTICLE 3 
  DEFERRALS, CREDITING AND DEBITING ACCOUNTS, TAXES 
  3.1      Deferred Compensation.   A Participant may elect to defer compensation payable under an 
  Incentive Plan or as a one-time cash award made to a newly hired employee. 
  3.2      Election to Defer Compensation.   A Participant shall make a deferral election by timely 
  filing an Election Form in accordance with the Administrator's rule and procedures. If no Election Form is timely filed for a Plan Year, no Annual Deferral Amount shall be withheld for that Plan Year. Subject to such generally applicable exceptions as may be authorized by the Administrator and applicable law, a Participant's election to defer compensation for services performed during a calendar year must be filed before the later of (i) the last day of the immediately preceding Plan Year, or (ii) 30 days after the date the Participant is notified of his initial eligibility to participate in the Plan and other nonqualified deferred     compensation plans treated as a single plan with this Plan under section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the case of performance based compensation based on services performed over a period of at least 12 months, the election to defer must be made no later than six months before the end of the performance period, the Participant must perform services continuously from the later of the beginning of the performance period or the date the performance criteria are established through the date an election is made under this Section 3.2 and the election is not made after the performance based compensation has become readily ascertainable. If a portion of such performance based compensation is readily ascertainable when an Election Form is filed, such election shall only apply to the portion of the performance based compensation that is not yet ascertainable. Notwithstanding the previous two sentences, in the case of performance based compensation where an Election Form is submitted in the first year of eligibility under the Plan and all other deferred compensation plans treated as a single plan with this Plan under section 409A of the Code, but after the beginning of the performance period, the Election Form will apply to the portion of the compensation equal to the total amount of the compensation for the service period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the performance period after the Election Form is submitted over the total number of days in the performance period. The election to defer a new Employee's one-time cash award must be made before performing services.  In addition, notwithstanding the preceding,   if and to the extent permitted by the Administrator and in accordance with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, a Participant may make an election to defer his or her Incentive Plan payments which qualify as Fiscal Year Compensation during such period as shall be established by the Administrator which ends no later than the close of the Company s taxable year immediately preceding the first taxable year of the Company in which any services are performed for which such compensation is payable.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any agreement, plan or arrangement maintained by the Company or its affiliates, in the event a Participant elects to defer all or a portion of an Incentive Plan payment in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the deferred Incentive Plan payment will vest, subject to continued employment with the Company or its affiliates, on the last day of applicable Company taxable year and no portion of the Incentive Plan payment, whether deferred or not, shall be payable during the Company s taxable year constituting the period of service (whether in the form of severance or otherwise). 
  3.3      Withholding of Deferral Amounts.    For each Plan Year, the Incentive Plan award and 
  one-time cash award portions of the Annual Deferral Amount shall be withheld and credited to the Participant's Elective Deferral Account at the time the Incentive Plan award or one-time cash award would otherwise be paid to the Participant.  For the avoidance of doubt, any Incentive Plan payment that is made on account of a Participant s termination of employment shall be considered termination pay and shall not be subject to an Election Form hereunder. 
  3.4      Selection of Deemed Investments.   The Committee shall select the Deemed Investments 
  that are available to measure the amounts to be credited under Section 3.5 based on each Participant's directions regarding the specific Deemed Investments allocable from time to time to the Participant's Elective Deferral Account. Deemed Investments shall be for bookkeeping purposes only, and a Participating Company shall not be obligated to invest in the Deemed Investments, or to acquire or maintain any actual investment. 
  3.5      Crediting and Debiting Accounts.   The Administrator shall determine, in its discretion, 
  the exact times and methods for crediting an Elective Deferral Account with changes in value of its Deemed Investments and debiting any distributions allocated thereto. The Committee may, at any time, change the timing or methods for such credits and debits; provided, however, that the times and methods in effect at any particular time shall be uniform among all Participants and Beneficiaries. 
  3.6      FICA and Other Taxes.   For each Plan Year in which a Participant elects an Annual 
  Deferral Amount, the Participating Company employing the Participant shall ratably withhold from that portion of the Participant's compensation that is not being deferred, the Participant's share of FICA taxes on the deferred amounts and an amount to pay the additional income tax at source on wages attributable to the pyramiding section 3401 wages and taxes. However, the Participant may be granted an election by the Administrator for such taxes to be withheld from the Annual Deferral Amount. Any such election shall be made at the time the Participant makes a deferral election under Section 3.2. If necessary, the Administrator shall reduce the Annual Deferral Amount in order to comply with applicable tax withholding requirements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may provide for such other mechanisms to withhold FICA or other taxes as is consistent with Code Section 409A. 
  3.7      Vesting.   A Participant shall at all times have a fully vested and nonforfeitable interest in 
  his or her Annual Deferral Amount and Elective Deferral Accounts. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a one-time cash award made to a newly hired employee that is deferred hereunder shall be subject to such vesting conditions as may be established by the Company from time to time.  In addition, notwithstanding the proceeding sentence, a Participant shall forfeit any benefit that is payable hereunder, regardless of when such benefit was accrued, if the Committee determines that the Participant has engaged in bribery, embezzlement, fraud, misappropriation of assets or receipt of kickbacks involving the Company or any Related Company. 
  ARTICLE 4 
  IN-SERVICE DISTRIBUTION AND UNFORESEEABLE FINANCIAL EMERGENCIES 
  4.1      In-Service Distribution.   In connection with each election to defer an Annual Deferral 
  Amount, a Participant may elect to receive a future "In-Service Distribution" from the Plan with respect to that Annual Deferral Amount. The In-Service Distribution that is equal to the Annual Deferral Amount plus amounts credited thereon under Section 3.5 shall be a lump sum payment or pursuant to an Annual Installment Method of up to 15 years, with the portion of the In-Service Distribution which is yet to be distributed being credited with amounts as set forth in Section 3.5. Subject to the other terms and provisions of the Plan, each In-Service Distribution elected shall be paid within 90 days after the first day of the Plan Year that is one or more years after the first day of the Plan Year in which an Annual Deferral Amount is actually deferred (e.g., deferral elections in 2005 for amounts payable in 2006 may specify a January 1 distribution date in 2007 or later). A Participant may at any time before Separation from Service and at least 12 months before a distribution date modify a previous election pertaining to the form of distribution and/or the distribution date, provided the modification does not (i) accelerate a previously elected distribution date, (ii) defer a previously elected distribution date unless the requested deferral is for no less than five years in whole year increments and (iii) take effect until at least 12 months after the date it is made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should an event occur that triggers a benefit payment under Articles 5 through 7, any amount that is subject to an In-Service Distribution election under this Section 4.1 and is scheduled to be paid in a subsequent Plan Year shall be paid instead in accordance with the other applicable Article of the Plan.  
  4.2      Payout for Unforeseeable Financial Emergencies.   If the Participant experiences an 
  Unforeseeable Financial Emergency, the Participant may petition the Committee to receive partial or full payout from the Plan. The payout shall not exceed the lesser of the Account Balances of the Participant, calculated as if such Participant were receiving a Termination Benefit, or the amount necessary to satisfy the emergency and pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the payout, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent such liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship). 
  ARTICLE 5 
  RETIREMENT BENEFIT 
  5.1      Retirement Benefit.   A Participant who Retires shall receive, as a Retirement Benefit, his 
  or her Account Balances. 
  5.2      Payment of Retirement Benefits.   A Participant shall elect on an Election Form to receive 
  the Retirement Benefit attributable to an Account Balance in a lump sum or pursuant to an Annual Installment Method of up to 15 years. If the aggregate amount of the remaining Account Balances under this Plan and all other nonqualified deferred compensation plans treated as a single plan with this Plan under section 409A of the Code is under $10,000, the Administrator shall authorize payment of such amount under this Plan and such other plans in the form of a lump sum. Subject to Section 14.17, a lump sum payment shall be made within 90 days after the date the Participant Retires or January 1 in one of the next following five years, as elected by the Participant. Subject to Section 14.17, payments made under an Annual Installment Method shall commence within 90 days after the date the Participant Retires or January 1 in one of the next following five years, as elected by the Participant. If no election is made with respect to the form of distribution, payment shall be made in a lump sum. A Participant may at any time before Retirement and at least 12 months before a distribution date modify a previous election pertaining to the form of distribution and/or the distribution date, provided the modification (i) does not accelerate a previously elected distribution date, (ii) defers a previously elected distribution date for five years in whole year increments, and (iii) does not take effect until at least 12 months after the date it is made.  
  5.3      Death Prior to Complete Payment of Retirement Benefits.   If a Participant dies after 
  Retirement but before the Retirement Benefit is paid in full, the Participant's unpaid Retirement Benefit shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary over the remaining number of years and in the same amounts as that benefit would have been paid to the Participant had the Participant survived. 
  ARTICLE 6 
  PRE-RETIREMENT SURVIVOR BENEFIT 
  6.1      Pre-Retirement. Survivor Benefit.   If a Participant dies before Separation from Service or 
  Retirement, the Participant's Beneficiary shall receive, as a Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit, the Participant's Account Balances. 
  6.2      Payment of Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefits.   The Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit 
  shall be paid in a lump sum as soon within 90 days following the Participant's death. 
  ARTICLE 7

  the Participant shall receive, as a Termination Benefit, the Participant's Account Balances. 
  7.2      Payment of Termination Benefit.   Subject to Section 14.17, a Participant's Termination 
  Benefit shall be paid in a lump sum within 90 days following the date of the Participant's Separation from Service, or the next following January 1, as elected by the Participant. If no election is made, the Participant's Termination Benefit shall be paid in a lump sum within 90 days following the date of the Participant's Separation from Service. Any election or modified election under this Section 7.2 shall be disregarded to the extent it fails to meet the limitations or requirements of section 409A of the Code. 
  7.3      Death Prior to Payment of Termination Benefits.   If a Participant dies after Separation 
  from Service, but before the Termination Benefit is paid, the Participant's unpaid Termination Benefit shall be paid in a lump sum to the Participant's Beneficiary within 90 days following the Participant's death. 

ARTICLE 8 
  BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION 
  8.1      Beneficiary.   Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate his or her 
  Beneficiary (both primary as well as contingent) to receive any benefits payable under the Plan to a Beneficiary upon the death of a Participant. 
  8.2      Beneficiary Designation.   A Participant shall designate his or her Beneficiary on a 
  Beneficiary Designation Form in accordance with the Administrator's rules and procedures, as in effect from time to time. 
  8.3      No Beneficiary Designation.   If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided 
  in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 above, or, if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or die prior to complete distribution of the Participant's benefits, then the Participant's designated Beneficiary shall be his or her surviving spouse. If the Participant has no surviving spouse, the benefits remaining under the Plan shall be paid to the Participant's issue upon the principle of representation and if there is no such issue, to the Participant's estate.  

8.4      Doubt as to Beneficiary.   If the Administrator has any doubt as to the proper Beneficiary to receive payments pursuant to this Plan, the Administrator shall have the right, exercisable in its sole and absolute discretion, to cause such payments to be withheld until the matter is resolved. 
  ARTICLE 9 
  LEAVE OF ABSENCE 
  Unless the Participant incurs a Separation from Service, a Participant is authorized for any reason to take a leave of absence from employment, the Participant shall continue to be considered in the service of the Participating Company for purposes hereof and the Annual Deferral Amount shall continue to be withheld during such leave of absence in accordance with Section 3.3. 
  ARTICLE 10 
  TERMINATION, AMENDMENT, OR MODIFICATION 
  10.1      Termination.   The Company reserves the right to terminate the Plan by action of the 
  Board within 12 months of a Change in Control of the Company. Upon such Change in Control and termination of the Plan, Participants' Account Balances and all account balances of all other nonqualified deferred compensation plans treated as a single plan with this Plan under section 409A of the Code shall be paid in a lump sum within 90 days after the date of Plan termination, subject to any applicable limitations of section 409A of the Code. In addition, the Company reserves the right to terminate this Plan at any time effective with respect to any Plan Year that commences subsequent to the date action is taken by the Company to terminate this Plan, subject to the last sentence of Section 10.2. In the event the Plan is terminated, no further deferrals shall be made after the effective date of the Plan's termination except as required to avoid taxation under Code Section 409A, and payment of each Participant's Account Balance shall be made in accordance with the payment provisions of Articles 4 through 7. The preceding provisions of this Section 10.1 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may in its discretion terminate the Plan effective as of a date that is prior to the first day of a subsequent Plan Year and provide for accelerated payments of all amounts credited on behalf of all Participants upon a termination of the Plan to the extent such termination and acceleration of payments satisfies the applicable requirements upon the termination of a plan pursuant to Code Section 409A. 
  10.2      Amendment.   The Committee may, at any time, amend or modify the Plan in whole or in part; provided, however, that no amendment or modification shall be effective to decrease a Participant's Account Balances at the time of such amendment, calculated as though the Participant had experienced a Separation from Service as of the effective date of the amendment or modification, or, if the amendment or modification occurs after the date upon which the Participant was eligible to Retire, the Participant had Retired as of the effective date of the amendment or modification. In addition, no amendment or modification of the Plan shall affect the right of any Participant or Beneficiary who was eligible to or did Retire on or before the effective date of such amendment or modification to receive benefits in the manner he or she elected. 
  10.3      Effect of Payment.   The full payment of the applicable benefit under the Plan shall 
  completely discharge all obligations to a Participant under the Plan. 
  ARTICLE 11 
  ADMINISTRATION 
  11.1      Committee Duties.   The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee 
  shall also have the discretion and authority to make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules 
  and regulations for the administration of the Plan and decide or resolve any and all questions, including but not limited to, interpretations of the Plan and entitlement to or amount of benefits under the Plan, as may arise in connection with the Plan. Any Committee member must recuse himself or herself on any matter of personal interest to such member that comes before the Committee. 
    
  11.2      Agents.   In the administration of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, engage agents, including the Administrator, and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit and may from time to time consult with counsel who may be counsel to any Participating Company. 
  11.3      Binding Effect of Decisions.   The decision or action of the Committee with respect to any 
  question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan.

  ARTICLE 12 
  CLAIMS PROCEDURE 
  12.1      Presentation of Claim.   Any Participant or Beneficiary of a deceased Participant (such 
  Participant or Beneficiary being referred to below as a "Claimant") may deliver to the Committee a written claim for a determination with respect to the amounts distributable to such Claimant from the Plan. If such a claim relates to the contents of a notice received by the Claimant, the claim must be made within 90 days after such notice was received by the Claimant. The claim must state with particularity the determination desired by the Claimant. All other claims must be made within 180 days of the date on which the event that caused the claim to arise occurred.

  (a)  That the Claimant's requested determination has been made, and that the claim has been allowed in full; or 
  (b)  That the Committee has reached a conclusion contrary, in whole or in part, to the Claimant's requested determination, and such notice must set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant: 
  (i)  the specific reason(s) for the denial if the claim, or any part of it; 
  (ii)  specific reference(s) to pertinent provisions of the Plan upon which such denial was based; 
  (iii)  a description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim, and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and 
  (iv)  an explanation of the claim review procedure set forth in Section 12.3 below and a statement of the Claimant's right to bring a civil action under section 502 of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination upon review. 
  12.3      Review of a Denied Claim.   Within 90 days after receiving a notice from the Committee that a claim has been denied, in whole or in part, a Claimant (or the Claimant's duly authorized representative) may file with the Committee a written request for a review of the denial of the claim. Thereafter, the Claimant (or the Claimant's duly authorized representative):

  (d)  a statement that the Participant's right to bring an action under section 502 of ERISA. 
  12.5      Legal Action.   A Claimant's compliance with the foregoing provisions of this Article 12 
  is a mandatory prerequisite to a Claimant's right to commence any arbitration proceeding with respect to any claim for benefits under this Plan. 
  12.6      Arbitration.   Any claim or controversy which the parties are unable to resolve themselves, and which is not resolved through the claims procedure set forth in this Article 12, including any claim arising out of a Participant's employment or the termination of that employment, and including any claim arising out of, connected with, or related to the formation, interpretation, performance, or breach of any provision of the Plan, and any claim or dispute as to whether a claim is subject to arbitration, shall be submitted to and resolved exclusively by expedited binding arbitration by a single arbitrator in accordance with the following procedures: 
  (a)    In the event of a claim or controversy subject to this arbitration provision, the complaining party shall promptly send written notice to the other party identifying the matter in dispute and the proposed remedy. Following the giving of such notice, the parties shall meet and attempt in good faith to resolve the matter. In the event the parties are unable to resolve the matter within 21 days, the parties shall meet and attempt in good faith to select a single arbitrator acceptable to both parties. If a single arbitrator is not selected by mutual consent within 10 business days following the giving of written notice of dispute, an arbitrator shall be selected from a list of nine persons each of whom shall be an attorney who is either engaged in the active practice of law or a recognized arbitrator and who, in either event, is experienced in serving as an arbitrator in disputes between employers and employees, which list shall be provided by the main San Francisco office of either JAMS, the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. If, within three business days of the parties' receipt of such list, the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator from the list, then the parties shall each strike names alternatively from the list, with the first to strike being determined by the flip of a coin. After each party has had four strikes, the remaining name on the list shall be the arbitrator. If such person is unable to serve for any reason, the parties shall repeat this process until an arbitrator is selected.  
  (b)  Unless the parties agree otherwise, within 90 days of the selection of the arbitrator, a hearing shall be conducted before such arbitrator at a time and a place agreed upon by the parties. In the event the parties are unable to agree upon the time or place of the arbitration, the time and place shall be designated by the arbitrator after consultation with the parties. Within 30 days of the conclusion of the arbitration hearing, the arbitrator shall issue an award, accompanied by a written decision explaining the basis for the arbitrator's award. 
  (c)  In any arbitration hereunder, the Participant's Participating Company shall pay all administrative fees of the arbitration and all fees of the arbitrator, except that the Participant or Beneficiary may, if he/she/it wishes, pay up to one-half of those amounts. Each party shall pay its own attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses, unless the arbitrator orders otherwise. The prevailing party in such arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator, and in any enforcement or other court proceedings, shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by law, to reimbursement from the other party for all of the prevailing party's costs (including but not limited to the arbitrator's compensation), expenses, and attorneys' fees. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to or to modify the Plan, shall apply all applicable law, and shall have no lesser and no greater remedial authority than would a court of law resolving the same claim or controversy. The arbitrator shall, upon an appropriate motion, dismiss any claim without an evidentiary hearing if the party bringing the motion establishes that it would be entitled to summary judgment if the matter had been pursued in court litigation. The parties shall be entitled to discovery as follows. Each party may take no more than three depositions. The Participating Company may depose the Participant or Beneficiary plus two other witnesses, and Participant or Beneficiary may depose the Participating Company, within the meaning of Rule 30(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, plus two other witnesses. Each party may make such reasonable document discovery requests as are allowed in the discretion of the arbitrator. 
  (d)  The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, binding, and non-appealable, and may be enforced as a final judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
  (e)  This arbitration provision of the Plan shall extend to claims against any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of each party, and, when acting within such capacity, any officer, director, shareholder, Participant, Beneficiary, or agent of each party, or of any of the above, and shall apply as well to claims arising out of state and federal statutes and local ordinances as well as to claims arising under the common law or under this Plan. 
  (f)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, and unless otherwise agreed between the parties, either party may, in an appropriate matter, apply to a court for provisional relief, including a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, on the ground that the arbitration award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief. 
  (g)  Any arbitration hereunder shall be conducted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act; provided, however, that, in the even of any inconsistency between the rules and procedures of the Act and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall prevail. 

(h)  If any of the provisions of this Section 12.6 are determined to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such determination shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Section 12.6, and this Section 12.6 shall be reformed to the extent necessary to carry out its provisions to the greatest extent possible and to insure that the resolution of all conflicts between the parties, including those arising out of statutory claims, shall be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration. If a court should find that the provisions of this Section 12.6 are not absolutely binding, then the parties intend any arbitration decision and award to be fully admissible in evidence in any subsequent action, given great weight by any finder of fact, and treated as determinative to the maximum extent permitted by law. 
  (i)  The parties do not agree to arbitrate any putative class action or any other representative action. The parties agree to arbitrate only the claim(s) of a single Participant. 
  ARTICLE 13   TRUST 
  13.1      Establishment of Trust.   The Company shall establish the Trust, and the Company shall 
  transfer over to the Trust such assets, if any, as the Committee determines, from time to time and in its sole discretion, are appropriate. 
  13.2      Interrelationship of the Plan and the Trust.   The provisions of the Plan shall govern the 
  rights of a Participant to receive distributions pursuant to the Plan. The provisions of the Trust shall govern the rights of the Participant and the creditors of the Participating Companies to the assets transferred to the Trust. Each Participating Company shall at all times remain liable to carry out its obligations under the Plan with respect to the Participants who are or were its Employees. A Participating Company's obligations under the Plan may be satisfied with Trust assets distributed pursuant to the terms of the Trust. Any such distribution shall reduce a Participating Company's obligations under the Plan. 

ARTICLE 14 
  MISCELLANEOUS 
  14.1      Unsecured General Creditor.   Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors, and 
  assigns shall have no legal or equitable right or interest in or claim to any property or assets of the Company or any Participating Company.

No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payments be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony, or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency. 
  14.3      Coordination with Other Benefits.   The benefits provided for a Participant and 
  Participant's Beneficiary under the Plan are in addition to any other benefits available to such Participant under any other plan or program for employees of the Participant's Participating Company. The Plan shall supplement and shall not supersede, modify, or amend any other such plan or program except as may otherwise be expressly provided. 
  14.4      Not a Contract of Employment.   The terms and conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment between any Participating Company and the Participant. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant the right to be retained in the employed of any Participating Company, or to interfere with the right of any Participating Company to discipline, demote, discharge or change the terms of employment at any time, with or without cause, of the Participant at any time. 
  14.5      Furnishing Information.   A Participant or his or her Beneficiary will cooperate with the

  14.6      Terms.   Whenever any words are used herein in the singular or in the plural, they shall be construed as though they were used in the plural or the singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply.

The interest in the benefits hereunder of a spouse of a Participant who has predeceased the Participant shall automatically pass to the Participant and shall not be transferable by such spouse in any manner, including but not limited to such spouse's will.  
  14.12      Validity.   In case any provision of the Plan shall be illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts hereof, but the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted herein.  
  14.13      Incompetent.   If the Committee determines in its discretion that a benefit under the Plan is to be paid to a minor, a person declared incompetent or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of that person's property, the Committee may direct payment of such benefit to the guardian, legal representative, or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent, or incapable person. The Committee may require proof of minority, incompetency, incapacity, or guardianship, as it may deem appropriate prior to distribution of the benefit. Any payment of a benefit shall be a payment for the account of the Participant and the Participant's Beneficiary, as the case may be, and shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the Plan for such payment amount.  
  14.14      Court Order.   The Committee may authorize any payments directed by court order in any action in which the Plan or Committee has been named as a party.  
  14.15      Payment in the Event of Taxation.   If, for any reason, all or any portion of a Participant's benefit under the Plan becomes taxable to the Participant prior to receipt, the Participant may petition the Committee for a distribution of assets sufficient to meet the Participant's tax liability (including additions to tax, penalties, and interest). Upon the, grant of such a petition, which grant shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Participant's Participating Company shall pay to the Participant an amount equal to that Participant's federal, state, and local tax liability associated with such taxation (which amount shall not exceed the Participant's Account Balances), which liability shall be measured by using that Participant's then current highest federal, state, and local marginal tax rate, plus the rates or amounts for the applicable additions to tax, penalties, and interest. If the petition is granted, the tax liability payment shall be made within ninety days of the date when the Participant's petition is granted. Such payment shall reduce the benefits to be paid under the Plan.  
  14.16      Specified Employees.   If, at the time of payment of the Participant's Retirement Benefit or Termination Benefit, the Participant is a "specified employee" (using the default provisions of Section 1.409A-1(i) of the Treasury Regulations) and the deferral of the commencement of any benefits payable pursuant to this Plan is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under section 409A of the Code, then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the Participant) until the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six (6) months following the Participant's Separation from Service. If any payments are deferred due to such requirements, such amounts will be paid in a lump sum to the Participant on the earliest of (a) the Participant's death following the date of the Participant's Separation from Service with the Company or (b) the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six (6) months following the Participant's Separation from Service with the Company.  
  14.17      Section 409A.   This Plan is intended to comply with Code Section 409A and the Treasury regulations and other guidance thereunder ( Section 409A ) and shall be interpreted in accordance therewith.   
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF,   the Company has executed this Visa 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan document on August 12, 2015.

 STATEMENT OF COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES

Exhibit 

Exhibit 12.1 
    
  VISA INC. 
  STATEMENT OF COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES  

(1)   
    During fiscal 2015, we recorded an increase of $110 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating expense. See   Note 2 Visa Europe   and     Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments   to our consolidated financial statements of this report. 
               (2)   
    During fiscal 2014 and 2012, we recorded litigation provisions of $450 million and $4.1 billion, respectively, and related tax benefits, associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See   Note 3 U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities   and   Note 20 Legal Matters     to our consolidated financial statements of this report. 
               (3)   
    Interest expense for the five years presented primarily consists of accretion on litigation matters, interest expense related to uncertain tax positions and interest expense on outstanding debt. Interest expense related to uncertain tax positions for the years ended   September 30, 2015  ,   2014  ,   2013  ,   2012   and   2011   was $(6) million, $10 million, $9 million, $(45) million and $7 million, respectively. During fiscal 2012, we reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2011. 
               (4)   
    Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings to fixed charges ratios are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
