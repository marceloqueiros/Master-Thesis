  Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. 
  Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the actual future results of MetLife, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates. These statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.

These factors include: (1) difficult conditions in the global capital markets; (2) increased volatility and disruption of the global capital and credit markets, which may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital, including through our credit facilities, generate fee income and market-related revenue and finance statutory reserve requirements and may require us to pledge collateral or make payments related to declines in value of specified assets, including assets supporting risks ceded to certain of our captive reinsurers or hedging arrangements associated with those risks; (3) exposure to global financial and capital market risks, including as a result of the disruption in Europe and possible withdrawal of one or more countries from the Euro zone; (4) impact of comprehensive financial services regulation reform on us, as a non-bank systemically important financial institution, or otherwise; (5) numerous rulemaking initiatives required or permitted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which may impact how we conduct our business, including those compelling the liquidation of certain financial institutions; (6) regulatory, legislative or tax changes relating to our insurance, international, or other operations that may affect the cost of, or demand for, our products or services, or increase the cost or administrative burdens of providing benefits to employees; (7) adverse results or other consequences from litigation, arbitration or regulatory investigations; (8) our ability to address difficulties, unforeseen liabilities, asset impairments, or rating agency actions arising from (a) business acquisitions and integrating and managing the growth of such acquired businesses, (b) dispositions of businesses via sale, initial public offering, spin-off or otherwise, (c) entry into joint ventures, or (d) legal entity reorganizations; (9) potential liquidity and other risks resulting from our participation in a securities lending program and other transactions; (10) investment losses and defaults, and changes to investment valuations; (11) changes in assumptions related to investment valuations, deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements, value of business acquired or goodwill; (12) impairments of goodwill and realized losses or market value impairments to illiquid assets; (13) defaults on our mortgage loans; (14) the defaults or deteriorating credit of other financial institutions that could adversely affect us; (15) economic, political, legal, currency and other risks relating to our international operations, including with respect to fluctuations of exchange rates; (16) downgrades in our claims paying ability, financial strength or credit ratings; (17) a deterioration in the experience of the  closed block  established in connection with the reorganization of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; (18) availability and effectiveness of reinsurance or indemnification arrangements, as well as any default or failure of counterparties to perform; (19) differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions; (20) ineffectiveness of risk management policies and procedures; (21) catastrophe losses; (22) increasing cost and limited market capacity for statutory life insurance reserve financings; (23) heightened competition, including with respect to pricing, entry of new competitors, consolidation of distributors, the development of new products by new and existing competitors, and for personnel; (24) exposure to losses related to variable annuity guarantee benefits, including from significant and sustained downturns or extreme volatility in equity markets, reduced interest rates, unanticipated policyholder behavior, mortality or longevity, and the adjustment for nonperformance risk; (25) regulatory and other restrictions affecting MetLife, Inc. s ability to pay dividends and repurchase common stock; (26) MetLife, Inc. s primary reliance, as a holding company, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its free cash flow targets and debt payment obligations and the applicable regulatory restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay such dividends; (27) the possibility that MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors may influence the outcome of stockholder votes through the voting provisions of the MetLife Policyholder Trust; (28) changes in accounting standards, practices and/or policies; (29) increased expenses relating to pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as health care and other employee benefits; (30) inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of

   Overview 
  As used in this Form 10-K,  MetLife,  the  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. 
  We have grown to become a global provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we hold leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Over the past several years, we have grown our core businesses, as well as successfully executed on our growth strategy. This has included completing a number of transactions that have resulted in the acquisition and, in some cases, divestiture of certain businesses while also further strengthening our balance sheet to position MetLife for continued growth. 
  We are also one of the largest institutional investors in the U.S. with a $508.2 billion general account portfolio invested primarily in investment grade corporate bonds, structured finance securities, mortgage loans and U.S. Treasury and agency securities, as well as real estate and corporate equity, at   December 31, 2015  . Over the past several years, we have further diversified and strengthened our general account portfolio. 
  Our well-recognized brand, leading market positions, competitive and innovative product offerings and financial strength and expertise should help drive future growth and enhance shareholder value, building on a long history of fairness, honesty and integrity. Over the course of the next several years, we will pursue the following objectives to position the Company for continued growth and achieve our vision of being recognized as the leading global life insurance and employee benefits provider: 

Refocus the U.S. businesses 

Shift product mix away from capital intensive products 

Invest in growth initiatives for the voluntary/worksite, accident   health, and direct channels 

Drive margin improvement 

Build the Global Employee Benefits business 

Accelerate our local employee benefits businesses in key markets outside the U.S. 

Grow our global employee benefits businesses through multinational and expatriate solutions

       Table of Contents  

Grow emerging markets presence 

Accelerate earnings in emerging markets in which we already have a strong presence 

Seek opportunistic mergers and acquisitions to complement our organic growth 

Drive toward Customer Centricity and a global brand 

Further institutionalize customer-centric actions and culture at MetLife 

Grow consideration of and preference for MetLife s brand in key markets 

MetLife is organized into six segments, reflecting three broad geographic regions: Retail; Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits; Corporate Benefit Funding; and Latin America (collectively, the  Americas  Asia; and Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ). In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate   Other. See    Segments and Corporate   Other  and Note   2   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company s segments and Corporate   Other. See also    Other Key Information  for information on the Company s announcement of   its plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of its Retail segment, which is organized into two U.S. businesses, Life   Other and Annuities, as well as certain portions of its Corporate Benefit Funding segment and Corporate   Other (the  Separation ).   Management continues to evaluate the Company s segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability. 
  
  In the U.S., we provide a variety of insurance and financial services products, including life, dental, disability, property   casualty, guaranteed interest, stable value and annuities, through both proprietary and independent retail distribution channels, as well as at the workplace.  
  Outside the U.S., we provide life, medical, dental, credit and other accident   health insurance, as well as annuities, endowment and retirement   savings products to both individuals and groups. We believe these businesses will continue to grow more quickly than our U.S. businesses. 
  Revenues derived from any customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated premiums, universal life and investment-type product policy fees and other revenues for the years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . Financial information, including revenues, expenses, operating earnings, and total assets by segment, as well as premiums, universal life and investment-type product policy fees and other revenues by major product groups, is provided in Note   2   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating revenues and operating earnings are performance measures that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures  for definitions of such measures. 
  For financial information related to revenues, total assets, and goodwill balances by geographic region, see Notes   2   and   11   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   Other Key Information 
  On January 12, 2016, the Company announced its plan to pursue the Separation. The Company is currently evaluating structural alternatives for the proposed Separation, including a public offering of shares in an independent, publicly traded company, a spin-off, or a sale. The completion of a public offering would depend on, among other things, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) filing and review process, as well as market conditions. Any Separation that might occur will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval of any transaction by the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the SEC, and receipt of insurance and other regulatory approvals and other anticipated conditions.  
  In November 2014, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut ( MICC ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., re-domesticated from Connecticut to Delaware, changed its name to MetLife Insurance Company USA and merged with its subsidiary, MetLife Investors USA Insurance Company ( MLI-USA ), and its affiliate, MetLife Investors Insurance Company ( MLIIC ), each a U.S. insurance company that issued variable annuity products in addition to other products, and Exeter Reassurance Company, Ltd. ( Exeter ), a former offshore, captive reinsurance subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. and affiliate of MICC that mainly reinsured guarantees associated with variable annuity products (the  Mergers ). The surviving entity of the Mergers was MetLife Insurance Company USA ( MetLife USA ). See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Executive Summary   Other Key Information   Significant Events  for further information on the Mergers. 
  In October 2013, MetLife, Inc. completed its acquisition of Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones Provida S.A. ( ProVida ), the largest private pension fund administrator in Chile based on assets under management and number of pension fund contributors. The acquisition of ProVida supports the Company's growth strategy in emerging markets and further strengthens the Company's overall position in Chile. See Note   3   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Certain international subsidiaries have a fiscal year cutoff of November 30   th   . Accordingly, the Company s consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries as of November 30,   2015   and   2014   and the operating results of such subsidiaries for the years ended November 30,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . The Company is in the process of converting to calendar year reporting for these subsidiaries. These conversions are expected to be substantially complete in the first quarter of 2016. The impact of the conversions on our financial statements to date has been de minimis and, therefore, has been reported in net income in the quarter of conversion.

    7 

     Table of Contents  

   The major products within Life   Other are as follows:  
  Variable Life.   Variable life products provide insurance coverage through a contract that gives the policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending on the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with certain guarantees. Most importantly, with variable life products, premiums and account balances can be directed by the policyholder into a variety of separate account investment options or directed to the Company s general account. In the separate account investment options, the policyholder bears the entire risk of the investment results. We collect specified fees for the management of the investment options. The policyholder s cash value reflects the investment return of the selected investment options, net of management fees and insurance-related and other charges. In some instances, third-party money management firms manage these investment options. With some products, by maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse investment experience. 
  Universal Life.   Universal life products provide insurance coverage on the same basis as variable life, except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated balances, are allocated only to the Company s general account. We credit premiums to an account maintained for the policyholder. Premiums are credited net of specified expenses. Interest is credited to the policyholder s account at interest rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Specific charges are made against the policyholder s account for the cost of insurance protection and for expenses. With some products, by maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse investment experience.  
  Term Life.   Term life products provide a guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured for a specified time period in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Specified coverage periods range from one year to 30 years, but in no event are they longer than the period over which premiums are paid. Death benefits may be level over the period or decreasing. Premiums may be guaranteed at a level amount for the coverage period or may be non-level and non-guaranteed. Term insurance products are sometimes referred to as pure protection products, in that there are typically no savings or investment elements. Term contracts expire without value at the end of the coverage period when the insured party is still living. 
  Whole Life.   Whole life products provide a guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured in return for the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a predetermined period. Premium payments may be required for the entire life of the contract period, to a specified age or period, and may be level or change in accordance with a predetermined schedule. Whole life insurance includes policies that provide a participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders may receive dividends in cash or apply them to increase death benefits, increase cash values available upon surrender or reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force. Because the use of dividends is specified by the policyholder, this group of products provides significant flexibility to individuals to tailor the product to suit their specific needs and circumstances, while at the same time providing guaranteed benefits. 
  Disability.   Disability products provide a benefit in the event of the disability of the insured. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of monthly income paid until the insured reaches age 65. In addition to income replacement, the product may be used to provide for the payment of business overhead expenses for disabled business owners or mortgage payment protection. 
  Property   Casualty.   These products include personal lines property   casualty insurance offered to individuals through a variety of retail distribution channels, including independent agents, property   casualty specialists, and the MetLife Premier Client Group. 
  Auto insurance policies provide coverage for private passenger automobiles, utility automobiles and vans, motorcycles, motor homes, antique or classic automobiles and trailers. We also offer traditional coverage such as liability, uninsured motorist, no fault or personal injury protection, as well as collision and comprehensive insurance. 
  Homeowners  insurance policies provide protection for homeowners, renters, condominium owners and residential landlords against losses arising out of damage to dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils, as well as coverage for liability arising from ownership or occupancy. Other insurance includes personal excess liability (protection against losses in excess of amounts covered by other liability insurance policies), and coverage for recreational vehicles and boat owners. Most of our homeowners  policies are traditional insurance policies for dwellings, providing protection for loss on a  replacement cost  basis. These policies also provide additional coverage for reasonable, normal living expenses incurred by policyholders that have been displaced from their homes.

   Other.   Additionally, through our broker-dealer affiliates, we offer a full range of mutual funds and other securities products. The elimination of transactions from activity between the segments within the Americas occurs within Life   Other. 
  Annuities 
  Our Annuities business offers a variety of variable and fixed annuities that are primarily sold to individuals and tax-qualified groups in the education, healthcare and not-for-profit sectors.  
  The major products within Annuities are as follows:  
  Variable Annuities.   Variable annuities provide for both asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Variable annuities allow the contractholder to make deposits into various investment options in a separate account, as determined by the contractholder. The risks associated with such investment options are borne entirely by the contractholder, except where guaranteed minimum benefits are involved. In certain variable annuity products, contractholders may also choose to allocate all or a portion of their account to the Company s general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. In addition, contractholders may also elect certain minimum death benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for which additional fees are charged and where asset allocation restrictions may apply. 
  Fixed and Indexed Annuities.   Fixed annuities provide for both asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Fixed annuities do not allow the same investment flexibility provided by variable annuities, but provide guarantees related to the preservation of principal and interest credited. Deposits made into deferred annuity contracts are allocated to the Company s general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Credited interest rates are guaranteed not to change for certain limited periods of time, ranging from one to 10 years. Fixed income annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified period of years and/or for the life of the annuitant. Additionally, the Company has recently begun issuing indexed annuities which allow the contractholder to participate in returns from equity indices. 
  Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits 
  We have built a leading position in the U.S. group insurance market through long-standing relationships with many of the largest corporate employers in the U.S. 
  Our Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits insurance products and services include life, dental, group short- and long-term disability, property   casualty, long-term care, accidental death and dismemberment ( AD D ), critical illness, vision and accident   health coverages, as well as prepaid legal plans. We also sell administrative services-only ( ASO ) arrangements to some employers. Under such ASO arrangements, the employer is at risk, as we have not issued an insurance policy. We pay claims funded by the employer and perform other administrative services on behalf of the employer. 
  The major products within Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits are as follows:  
  Life.   Life insurance products and services include variable life, universal life, and term life products. These are similar to the products offered by the Retail Life   Other business except we offer group insurance products as employer-paid benefits or as voluntary benefits where all or a portion of the premiums are paid by the employee. These life insurance products and services also include employee paid supplemental life and are offered as standard products or may be tailored to meet specific customer needs. 
  Dental.   Dental products provide insurance and ASO arrangements that assist employees, retirees and their families in maintaining oral health while reducing out-of-pocket expenses and providing superior customer service. Dental plans include the Preferred Dentist Program and the Dental Health Maintenance Organization.  
  Disability.   Disability products provide a benefit in the event of the disability of the insured. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of monthly income paid until the insured reaches age 65.  
  Property   Casualty.   These products include personal lines property   casualty insurance offered directly to employees at their employer s worksite through a variety of distribution channels, including independent agents, property   casualty specialists and direct marketing. The property   casualty products offered by the Group, Voluntary   Worksite business are the same products offered by the Retail property   casualty business.  
  Long-term Care.   Long-term care products provide protection against the potentially high costs of long-term care services. They generally pay benefits to insureds who need assistance with activities of daily living or have a cognitive impairment. Although we discontinued the sale of these products in 2010, we continue to support our existing policyholders.

   Corporate Benefit Funding 
  The Corporate Benefit Funding segment provides funding and financing solutions that help institutional customers mitigate and manage liabilities primarily associated with their qualified, nonqualified and welfare employee benefit programs using a spectrum of life and annuity-based insurance and investment products. 
  The major products within Corporate Benefit Funding are as follows:  
  Stable Value Products.   We offer general account guaranteed interest contracts, separate account guaranteed interest contracts, and similar products used to support the stable value option of defined contribution plans. We also offer private floating rate funding agreements that are used for money market funds, securities lending cash collateral portfolios and short-term investment funds. 
  General account guaranteed interest contracts are designed to provide stable value investment options within tax-qualified defined contribution plans. Traditional general account guaranteed interest contracts integrate a general account fixed or determinable fixed maturity investment with a general account guarantee of liquidity at contract value for participant transactions.  
  Separate account guaranteed interest contracts are available to defined contribution plan sponsors. These contracts integrate market value returns on separate account investments with a general account guarantee of liquidity at contract value to the extent the separate account assets are not sufficient. The contracts do not have a fixed maturity date and are terminable by each party on notice. 
  Private floating rate funding agreements are generally privately-placed, unregistered investment contracts issued as general account obligations. Interest is credited based on an external index, generally the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ). Contracts may contain put provisions (of 90 days or longer) that allow for the contractholder to receive the account balance prior to the stated maturity date.  
  Pension Risk Transfers.   We offer general account and separate account annuity products, generally in connection with the termination of defined benefit pension plans. These risk transfer products include single premium buyouts that allow for full or partial transfers of pension liabilities. 
  General account annuity products include nonparticipating contracts. Under nonparticipating contracts, group annuity benefits may be purchased for retired and terminated employees or employees covered under terminating or ongoing pension plans. Both immediate and deferred annuities may be purchased by a single premium at issue. There are generally no cash surrender rights, with some exceptions including certain contracts that include liabilities for cash balance pension plans. 
  Separate account annuity products include both participating and non-participating contracts. Under participating contracts, group annuity benefits are purchased for retired, terminated, or active employees covered under active or terminated pension plans. Both immediate and deferred fixed annuities are purchased with a single premium. Under some contracts, additional annuities may be periodically purchased at then current purchase rates. The assets supporting the guaranteed benefits for each contract are held in a separate account. Some contracts require the contractholder to make periodic payments to cover investment and insurance expenses. The Company fully guarantees benefit payments and is ultimately responsible for all benefit payments. The non-participating contracts have economic features similar to our general account product, but offer the added protection of an insulated separate account. Under U.S. GAAP, these annuity contracts are treated as general account products. 
  Institutional Income Annuities.   These general account contracts are available for purchasing guaranteed payout annuities for employees upon retirement or termination of employment. These annuities can be either life contingent or non-life contingent. These annuities are nonparticipating, do not provide for any loan or cash surrender value and, with few exceptions, do not permit future considerations. 
  Torts and Settlements.     We offer innovative strategies for complex litigation settlements, primarily structured settlement annuities. 
  Structured settlement annuities are customized annuities designed to serve as an alternative to a lump sum payment in a lawsuit initiated because of personal injury, wrongful death, or a workers  compensation claim or other claim for damages. Surrenders are generally not allowed, although commutations are permitted in certain circumstances. Guaranteed payments consist of life contingent annuities, term certain annuities and lump sums. 
  Capital Markets Investment Products.   Products we offer include funding agreements, funding agreement-backed notes and funding agreement-backed commercial paper. We also issue funding agreements to receive Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances and through a program with the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ( Farmer Mac ). 
    10 

     Table of Contents  

   Funding agreement-backed notes are part of a medium term note program, under which funding agreements are issued to a special-purpose trust that issues marketable notes in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. The proceeds of the issuance of a series of notes are used by the trust to acquire a funding agreement with matching interest and maturity payment terms from the Company. The notes are underwritten and marketed by major investment banks  broker-dealer operations and are sold to institutional investors. 
  Funding agreement-backed commercial paper is issued by a special purpose limited liability company which deposits the proceeds under a master funding agreement issued to it by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MLIC ) or MetLife USA. The commercial paper receives the same short-term credit rating as MLIC or MetLife USA and is marketed by major investment banks  broker-dealer operations. The program allows for funding agreement-backed commercial paper to be issued in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. 
  Through the Farmer Mac program, funding agreements have been issued by MLIC to Farmer Mac, as well as to certain special purpose entities ( SPEs ) that have issued debt securities for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements, and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment of interest and principal by Farmer Mac. 
  Other Corporate Benefit Funding Products and Services.   We offer specialized life insurance products and funding agreements designed specifically to provide solutions for funding postretirement benefits and company-, bank- or trust-owned life insurance used to finance nonqualified benefit programs for executives.

  Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits Distribution 
  Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits distributes its products and services through a sales force that is segmented by the size of the target customer. Marketing representatives sell either directly to corporate and other group customers or through an intermediary, such as a broker or consultant. In addition, voluntary products are sold by specialists. Employers have been emphasizing voluntary products and, as a result, we have increased our focus on communicating and marketing to employees in order to further foster sales of those products. 
  We are a leading provider of personal lines property   casualty insurance products offered to employees at their employer s worksite. Marketing representatives market personal lines property   casualty insurance products to employers through a variety of means, including broker referrals and cross-selling to group customers. Once permitted by the employer, MetLife commences marketing efforts to employees, enabling them to purchase coverage and to request payroll deduction over the telephone.

    Sales Distribution 
  Our Asia operations are geographically diverse with developed and emerging markets. We market our products and services through a multi-channel distribution strategy including career agency, bancassurance, direct marketing, brokerage, other third-party distribution and e-commerce. 
  Japan s multi-channel distribution strategy consists of captive agents, independent agents, bancassurance, direct marketing and brokers. While face-to-face channels continue to be core to Japan s business, other channels, including bancassurance and direct marketing, have become a critical part of Japan s distribution strategy. Our Japan operation has maintained its position in bancassurance due to its strong distribution relationship with Japan s mega banks, trust banks and various regional banks, as well as with the Japan Post. The direct marketing channel is supported by an industry-leading marketing platform, state-of-the-art call center infrastructure and its own campaign management system. Our direct marketing operations, the largest of which is in Japan, deploy both broadcast marketing approaches (e.g. direct response TV, web-based lead generation) and traditional direct marketing techniques such as inbound and outbound telemarketing. 
  Outside of Japan, our distribution strategies differ by country but generally utilize a combination of captive agents, bancassurance relationships and direct marketing. Throughout the region, our Asia operation leverages its expertise in direct marketing operations management to conduct its own campaigns and provide those direct marketing capabilities to third-party sponsors. While not a significant part of the region s overall business, sales of group life and pension business are primarily achieved through independent brokers and an employee sales force.

    Corporate   Other 
    Overview 
  The Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate   Other. Corporate   Other contains the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments, including external integration costs, internal resource costs for associates committed to acquisitions, enterprise-wide strategic initiative restructuring charges, various start-up businesses (including expatriate benefits insurance and our investment management business through which we offer fee-based investment management services to institutional clients) and certain run-off businesses. Corporate   Other also includes assumed reinsurance of certain variable annuity products from our former operating joint venture in Japan. Under this in-force reinsurance agreement, we reinsure living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with variable annuity products. Additionally, Corporate   Other includes interest expense related to the majority of the Company s outstanding debt and expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and income tax audit issues. Corporate   Other also includes the elimination of intersegment amounts, which generally relate to intersegment loans, which bear interest rates commensurate with related borrowings. 
    Policyholder Liabilities 
  We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to provide for future annuity payments. Our liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For life insurance and annuity products, we calculate these liabilities based on assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums to be received over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy, the amount of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the investments we make with the premiums we receive. We establish liabilities for claims and benefits based on assumptions and estimates of losses and liabilities incurred. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on policyholder liabilities see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates   Liability for Future Policy Benefits  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Policyholder Liabilities.  
  Pursuant to applicable insurance laws and regulations, MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated captive reinsurers, establish statutory reserves, reported as liabilities, to meet their obligations on their respective policies. These statutory reserves are established in amounts sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed rates. Statutory reserves and actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits generally differ based on accounting guidance. 
  U.S. state insurance laws and regulations require certain MetLife entities to submit to superintendents of insurance, with each annual report, an opinion and memorandum of a  qualified actuary  that the statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, make adequate provision for their statutory liabilities with respect to these obligations. See    Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Insurance Regulation   Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis.  
  Insurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. countries in which we operate require certain MetLife entities to prepare a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements, and to submit that analysis to the regulatory authorities. See    Regulation   International Regulation.

   Underwriting and Pricing 
  Our Global Risk Management Department ( GRM ) contains a dedicated unit, the primary responsibility of which is the development of product pricing standards and independent pricing and underwriting oversight for MetLife s insurance businesses. Further important controls around management of underwriting and pricing processes include regular experience studies to monitor assumptions against expectations, formal new product approval processes, periodic updates to product profitability studies and the use of reinsurance to manage our exposures, as appropriate. See    Reinsurance Activity.  
    Underwriting 
  Underwriting generally involves an evaluation of applications by a professional staff of underwriters and actuaries, who determine the type and the amount of insurance risk that we are willing to accept. We employ detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the underwriter to properly assess and quantify such risks before issuing policies to qualified applicants or groups. 
  Insurance underwriting considers not only an applicant s medical history, but also other factors such as financial profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco use. Group underwriting generally evaluates the risk characteristics of each prospective insured group, although with certain voluntary products and for certain coverages, members of a group may be underwritten on an individual basis. We generally perform our own underwriting; however, certain policies are reviewed by intermediaries under guidelines established by us. Generally, we are not obligated to accept any risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of policies to, any employer or intermediary. Requests for coverage are reviewed on their merits and a policy is not issued unless the particular risk or group has been examined and approved in accordance with our underwriting guidelines. 
  The underwriting conducted by our remote underwriting offices and intermediaries, as well as our corporate underwriting office, is subject to periodic quality assurance reviews to maintain high standards of underwriting and consistency. Such offices are also subject to periodic external audits by reinsurers with whom we do business. 
  We have established oversight of the underwriting process that facilitates quality sales and serves the needs of our customers, while supporting our financial strength and business objectives. Our goal is to achieve the underwriting, mortality and morbidity levels reflected in the assumptions in our product pricing. This is accomplished by determining and establishing underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies and strategies that are competitive and suitable for the customer, the agent and us. 
  For our property   casualty business, our underwriting function has six principal aspects: evaluating potential voluntary and worksite employer accounts and independent agencies; establishing guidelines for the binding of risks; reviewing coverage bound by agents; underwriting potential insureds, on a case by case basis, presented by agents outside the scope of their binding authority; pursuing information necessary in certain cases to enable issuance of a policy within our guidelines; and ensuring that renewal policies continue to be written at rates commensurate with risk. Subject to very few exceptions, agents in each of the distribution channels have binding authority for risks which fall within our published underwriting guidelines. Risks falling outside the underwriting guidelines may be submitted for approval to the underwriting department; alternatively, agents in such a situation may call the underwriting department to obtain authorization to bind the risk themselves. In most states, we generally have the right within a specified period (usually the first 60 days) to cancel any policy. 
  We continually review our underwriting guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our marketing strategies and profitability goals.  
    Pricing 
  Product pricing reflects our pricing standards, which are consistent for our global businesses. GRM, as well as regional finance and product teams are responsible for pricing and oversight for all of our insurance businesses. Product pricing is based on the expected payout of benefits calculated through the use of assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment returns, as well as certain macroeconomic factors, such as inflation. Investment-oriented products are priced based on various factors, which may include investment return, expenses, persistency and optionality and possible variability of results. For certain products, pricing may include prospective and retrospective experience rating features. Prospective experience rating involves the evaluation of past experience for the purpose of determining future premium rates and we bear all prior year gains and losses. Retrospective experience rating also involves the evaluation of past experience for the purpose of determining the actual cost of providing insurance for the customer; however, the contract includes certain features that allow us to recoup certain losses or distribute certain gains back to the policyholder based on actual prior years  experience.

     Table of Contents  

   Rates for group insurance and voluntary   worksite products (with the exception of property   casualty products) are based on anticipated earnings and expenses for the book of business being underwritten. Renewals are generally reevaluated annually or biannually and are repriced to reflect actual experience on such products. Products offered by Corporate Benefit Funding are priced on demand. Pricing reflects expected investment returns, as well as mortality, longevity and expense assumptions appropriate for each product. This business is generally nonparticipating and illiquid, as policyholders have few or no options or contractual rights to cash values. 
  Rates for individual life insurance products are highly regulated and generally must be approved by the regulators of the jurisdictions in which the product is sold. Generally, such products are renewed annually and may include pricing terms that are guaranteed for a certain period of time. Individual disability income products are based on anticipated results for the occupation being underwritten. Fixed and variable annuity products are also highly regulated and approved by the respective regulators. Such products generally include penalties for early withdrawals and policyholder benefit elections to tailor the form of the product s benefits to the needs of the opting policyholder. We periodically reevaluate the costs associated with such options and will periodically adjust pricing levels on our guarantees. Further, from time to time, we may also reevaluate the type and level of guarantee features currently being offered. 
  For our property   casualty business, our ability to set and change rates is subject to regulatory oversight. Rates for our major lines of property   casualty insurance are based on our proprietary database, rather than relying on rating bureaus. We determine prices in part from a number of variables specific to each risk. The pricing of personal lines insurance products takes into account, among other things, the expected frequency and severity of losses, the costs of providing coverage (including the costs of acquiring policyholders and administering policy benefits and other administrative and overhead costs such as reinsurance), competitive factors and profit considerations. The major pricing variables for personal lines insurance include characteristics of the insured property, such as age, make and model or construction type, as well as characteristics of the insureds, such as driving record and loss experience, and the insured s personal financial management. As a condition of our license to do business in each state, we, like all other personal lines insurers, are required to write or share the cost of private passenger automobile and homeowners insurance for higher risk individuals who would otherwise be unable to obtain such insurance. This  involuntary  market, also called the  shared market,  is governed by the applicable laws and regulations of each state, and policies written in this market are generally written at rates higher than standard rates and typically afford less coverage. 
  We continually review our pricing guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our marketing strategies and profitability goals.  
    Reinsurance Activity 
  We enter into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for our various insurance products and also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products issued by third parties. We participate in reinsurance activities in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. We enter into various agreements with reinsurers that cover individual risks, group risks or defined blocks of business, primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess or catastrophe excess basis. These reinsurance agreements spread risk and minimize the effect of losses. The extent of each risk retained by us depends on our evaluation of the specific risk, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on the characteristics of coverages. We also cede first dollar mortality risk under certain contracts. In addition to reinsuring mortality risk, we reinsure other risks, as well as specific coverages. We obtain reinsurance for capital requirement purposes and also when the economic impact of the reinsurance agreement makes it appropriate to do so. 
  Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer agrees to reimburse us for the ceded amount in the event a claim is paid. Cessions under reinsurance agreements do not discharge our obligations as the primary insurer. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible.

     Table of Contents  

   We reinsure our business through a diversified group of well-capitalized, highly rated reinsurers. We analyze recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with our reinsurers. We monitor ratings and evaluate the financial strength of our reinsurers by analyzing their financial statements. In addition, the reinsurance recoverable balance due from each reinsurer is evaluated as part of the overall monitoring process. Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances is evaluated based on these analyses. We generally secure large reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. Additionally, we enter into reinsurance agreements for risk and capital management purposes with several affiliated captive reinsurers. Captive reinsurers are affiliated insurance companies licensed under specific provisions of insurance law of their respective jurisdictions, such as the Special Purpose Financial Captive law adopted by several states including Vermont and Delaware, and have a very narrow business plan that specifically restricts the majority or all of their activity to reinsuring business from their affiliates. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Capital   Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions.   
    Americas - Excluding Latin America 
  For our Retail Life   Other insurance products, we have historically reinsured the mortality risk primarily on an excess of retention basis or on a quota share basis. We currently reinsure 90% of the mortality risk in excess of $2 million for most products. In addition to reinsuring mortality risk as described above, we reinsure other risks, as well as specific coverages. Placement of reinsurance is done primarily on an automatic basis and also on a facultative basis for risks with specified characteristics. On a case by case basis, we may retain up to $20 million per life and reinsure 100% of amounts in excess of the amount we retain. We evaluate our reinsurance programs routinely and may increase or decrease our retention at any time. 
  For our Retail Annuities business, we reinsure a portion of the living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with our variable annuities. Under these reinsurance agreements, we pay a reinsurance premium generally based on fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and receive reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations. 
  For our Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits segment, we generally retain most of the risk and only cede particular risk on certain client arrangements. The majority of our reinsurance activity within this segment relates to the following client agreements: 
             
    Employer sponsored captive programs: through these programs, employers buy a group life insurance policy with the condition that a portion of the risk is reinsured back to a captive insurer sponsored by the client. 
                
    Risk-sharing agreements: through these programs, clients require that we reinsure a portion of the risk back to third parties, such as minority-owned reinsurers. 
                
    Multinational pooling: through these agreements, employers buy many group insurance policies which are aggregated in a single insurer via reinsurance. 
     The risks ceded under these agreements are generally quota shares of group life and disability policies. The cessions vary from 50% to 90% of all the risks of the policies. 
  For our property   casualty business within both the Retail and Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits segments, we purchase reinsurance to manage our exposure to large losses (primarily catastrophe losses) and to protect statutory surplus. We cede losses and premiums based upon the exposure of the policies subject to reinsurance. To manage exposure to large property   casualty losses, we purchase property catastrophe, casualty and property per risk excess of loss reinsurance protection. 
  For our Corporate Benefit Funding segment, we have periodically engaged in reinsurance activities on an opportunistic basis. There were no such transactions during the periods presented. 
    Latin America, Asia and EMEA 
  For certain life insurance products, we currently reinsure risks in excess of $5 million to external reinsurers on a yearly renewable term basis. We may also reinsure certain risks with external reinsurers depending upon the nature of the risk and local regulatory requirements. 
  For selected large corporate clients, we reinsure group employee benefits or credit insurance business with various client-affiliated reinsurance companies, covering policies issued to the employees or customers of the clients. Additionally, we cede and assume risk with other insurance companies when either company requires a business partner with the appropriate local licensing to issue certain types of policies in certain countries. In these cases, the assuming company typically underwrites the risks, develops the products and assumes most or all of the risk.

   We also have reinsurance agreements in-force that reinsure a portion of the living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with variable annuity products. Under these agreements, we pay reinsurance fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and receive reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations. 
    Corporate   Other 
  We reinsure through 100% quota share reinsurance agreements certain run-off long-term care and workers  compensation business written by MetLife USA. 
  Corporate   Other also has a reinsurance agreement in-force to reinsure the living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with certain variable annuity products. Under this agreement, we receive reinsurance fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and provide reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations. 
    Catastrophe Coverage 
  We have exposure to catastrophes which could contribute to significant fluctuations in our results of operations. We use excess reinsurance agreements, under which the direct writing company reinsures risk in excess of a specific dollar value for each policy within a class of policies, to provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposure to larger risks. Such excess reinsurance agreements include retention reinsurance agreements and quota share reinsurance agreements. Retention reinsurance agreements provide for a portion of a risk to remain with the direct writing company, and quota share reinsurance agreements provide for the direct writing company to transfer a fixed percentage of all risks of a class of policies. Our life insurance products, particularly group life, subject us to catastrophe risk which we do not reinsure other than through our ongoing mortality reinsurance program which transfers risk at the individual policy level. For the Americas, excluding Latin America, we use excess of retention and quota share reinsurance agreements to provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposure to larger risks. Currently, for Latin America, Asia and EMEA, we purchase catastrophe coverage to insure risks within certain countries deemed by management to be exposed to the greatest catastrophic risks.

   Overview 
  In the U.S., our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state le  vel with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. I  n addition, MetLife, Inc. and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions. As a non-bank systemically important financial institution ( non-bank SIFI ), MetLife, Inc. is also subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Federal Reserve Board ) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (collectively, with the Federal Reserve Board, the  Federal Reserve ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). Furthermore, some of MetLife s operations, products and services are subject to consumer protection laws, securities, broker-dealer and investment adviser regulations, environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations, and to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ). See        U.S. Regulation.  
  Our international insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. In addition, our investment and pension companies outside of the U.S. are subject to oversight by the relevant securities, pension and other authorities of the countries in which the companies operate. Our non-U.S. insurance businesses are also subject to current and developing solvency regimes which impose various capital and other requirements. As a global systemically important insurer ( G-SII ), MetLife, Inc. may also become subject to additional capital requirements. See        International Regulation.  
    U.S. Regulation 
    Insurance Regulation 
  State insurance regulation generally aims at supervising and regulating insurers, with the goal of protecting policyholders and ensuring that insurance companies remain solvent. Insurance regulators have increasingly sought information about the potential impact of activities in holding company systems as a whole, and some jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations enhancing  group-wide  supervision, as supported by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  ( NAIC ) Solvency Modernization Initiative. See    NAIC  for information regarding group-wide supervision. 
  Each of MetLife s insurance subsidiaries operating in the United States is licensed and regulated in each U.S. jurisdiction where it conducts insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial aspects and business conduct of insurers. State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: 
             
    licensing companies and agents to transact business; 
                
    calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; 
                
    mandating certain insurance benefits; 
                
    regulating certain premium rates; 
                
    reviewing and approving certain policy forms; 
                
    regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements, and identifying and paying to the states benefits and other property that is not claimed by the owners; 
                
    regulating advertising; 
                
    protecting privacy; 
                
    establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; 
                
    specifying the conditions under which a ceding company can take credit for reinsurance in its statutory financial statements (i.e., reduce its reserves by the amount of reserves ceded to a reinsurer); 
                
    fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; 
                
    adopting and enforcing suitability standards with respect to the sale of annuities and other insurance products; 
                
    approving changes in control of insurance companies; 
                
    restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and 
                
    regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. 
       22 

     Table of Contents  

   Each insurance subsidiary is required to file reports, generally including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which it does business, and its operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by such authorities. These subsidiaries must also file, and in many jurisdictions and in some lines of insurance obtain regulatory approval for, rules, rates and forms relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which they operate. 
  State and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general from time to time make inquiries regarding compliance by MetLife, Inc. and its insurance subsidiaries with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted. See Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Holding Company Regulation 
  Insurance holding company laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally require a controlled insurance company (insurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies) to register with state regulatory authorities and to file with those authorities certain reports, including information concerning its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. The NAIC adopted revisions to the NAIC Insurance Holding Company System Model Act ( Model Holding Company Act ) and the Insurance Holding Company System Model Regulation ( Regulation ) in December 2010 and December 2014. The Model Holding Company Act and Regulation serve as a basis for action by the states. See    NAIC  for further information on the Model Holding Company Act and Regulation. 
  State insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent companies, as well as on transactions between an insurer and its affiliates. Dividends in excess of prescribed limits and transactions above a specified size between an insurer and its affiliates require the approval of the insurance regulator in the insurer s state of domicile. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   MetLife, Inc.   Liquidity and Capital Sources   Dividends from Subsidiaries.  See also  Dividend Restrictions  in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding such limitations, as well as an amendment to the New York Insurance Law permitting MLIC to pay stockholder dividends to MetLife, Inc. in any calendar year without prior insurance regulatory clearance under one of two alternative formulations during 2016 and going forward. 
    Federal Initiatives 
  Although the insurance business in the United States is primarily regulated by the states, federal initiatives often have an impact on our business in a variety of ways. From time to time, federal measures are proposed which may significantly affect the insurance business. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, derivatives regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. See   Health Care Regulation  and  Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.  
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd-Frank ) effected the most far-reaching overhaul of financial regulation in the U.S. in decades. The full impact of Dodd-Frank on us will depend on the numerous rulemaking initiatives required or permitted by Dodd-Frank and the various studies mandated by Dodd-Frank, many of which remain to be completed. 
  Dodd-Frank established the Federal Insurance Office ( FIO ) within the Department of the Treasury, which has the authority to participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., as well as to collect information about the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council ( FSOC ) and making recommendations to the FSOC regarding insurers to be designated for more stringent regulation. On December 12, 2013, the FIO issued a report, mandated by Dodd-Frank, which, among other things, urged the states to modernize and promote greater uniformity in insurance regulation. However, the report also discussed potential federal solutions if states failed to modernize and improve regulation and some of the report s recommendations, for instance, favored a greater federal role in monitoring financial stability and identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of large national and internationally active insurers.

   Dodd-Frank also includes provisions that impact the investments and investment activities of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the federal regulation of such activities. Until the various final regulations are promulgated pursuant to Dodd-Frank, and perhaps for some time thereafter, the full impact of Dodd-Frank on such activities will remain unclear. Such provisions and regulations include, but are not limited to, the potential application of enhanced prudential standards and other restrictions, including the regulation of proprietary trading and sponsoring or investing in hedge funds or private equity funds, to non-bank SIFIs, all of which affect MetLife, Inc. as the FSOC has designated it as a non-bank SIFI. See    Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI.  
    Health Care Regulation  
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ), signed into law on March 23, 2010, and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, signed into law on March 30, 2010 (together, the  Affordable Care Act ), imposes obligations on MetLife as an enterprise, and as a provider of non-medical health insurance benefits and as a purchaser  s   of certain of these products. In 2014, we became subject to an excise tax called the  health insurer fee,  the cost of which is primarily passed on to group purchasers of certain of our dental and vision insurance products. Additionally, with respect to dental insurance products sold to groups with 50 or fewer employees, we have changed certain of our product offerings in response to the Affordable Care Act. The cost of these product changes will also be reflected in our pricing of such products. The Affordable Care Act and its related regulations have already resulted in increased and unpredictable costs to provide certain products and may have additional adverse effects. See  Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Legislative and Regulatory Activity in Health Care and Other Employee Benefits Could Affect our Profitability as a Provider of Life Insurance, Annuities, and Non-Medical Health Insurance Benefit Products.  It has also harmed our competitive position, as the Affordable Care Act has a disparate impact on our products compared to products offered by our not-for-profit competitors. 
  On July 14, 2014, the District of Columbia ( DC ) adopted a law that imposes an assessment on health insurers doing business in DC, including those that issue non-medical health-related products that are not subject to regulation under the Affordable Care Act. While the financial impact to the Company of DC s action will be minimal, if other states decide to successfully adopt this model, there could be an impact on product pricing and sales. Currently 16 states and DC have created their own public healthcare exchanges. One other state (Connecticut) has levied an assessment and other states may also consider levying assessments on both medical and non-medical health insurers to fund their healthcare exchanges. On June 25, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the King v. Burwell decision, upheld the payment of tax credits to individuals who purchase coverage in states that have a federally facilitated exchange rather than a state exchange. Had the Supreme Court not upheld this payment, it is likely more states would have been compelled to create their own exchanges and possibly assess insurers for the fees of running these exchanges. 
  The Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 also includes certain provisions for defined benefit pension plan funding relief. As part of our Corporate Benefit Funding segment, we offer general account and separate account group annuity products that enable a plan sponsor to transfer these risks, often in connection with the termination of defined benefit pension plans. See  Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Legislative and Regulatory Activity in Health Care and Other Employee Benefits Could Affect our Profitability as a Provider of Life Insurance, Annuities, and Non-Medical Health Insurance Benefit Products  for further information regarding the potential effect of such regulation. 
    Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements 
  Most of the U.S. jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business require life, health and property   casualty insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay certain contractual insurance benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. 
  In the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against MetLife have not been material. We have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate. See Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the insolvency assessments.

   Insurance Regulatory Examinations and Other Activities 
  As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records, accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their states. State insurance departments also have the authority to conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers that are licensed in their states. Except as otherwise disclosed in Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , MetLife did not receive any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance department examinations of its insurance subsidiaries. 
  Regulatory authorities in a small number of states, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) and, occasionally, the SEC, have had investigations or inquiries relating to sales of individual life insurance policies or annuities or other products by MLIC, MetLife USA, New England Life Insurance Company, General American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC ), and broker-dealer, MetLife Securities, Inc. These investigations often focus on the conduct of particular financial services representatives and the sale of unregistered or unsuitable products or the misuse of client assets. Over the past several years, these and a number of investigations by other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments and certain other relief, including restitution payments. We may continue to resolve investigations in a similar manner. 
  In addition, claims payment practices by insurance companies have received increased scrutiny from regulators. See Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding retained asset accounts and unclaimed property inquiries and related litigation. 
  We also received an inquiry relating to licensing. See Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the settlement of a licensing matter with the New York State Department of Financial Services (the  Department of Financial Services ) and the District Attorney, New York County, and a related amendment to the New York Insurance Law. 
  State insurance regulators and the NAIC are also investigating the use of affiliated captive reinsurers and offshore entities to reinsure insurance risks. The NAIC contracted with Rector   Associates to study captives and recommend additional regulation. Rector   Associates issued recommendations in June 2014, modifying its report which was released for comment in late February 2014 (as modified, the  Rector Report ). The Rector Report was adopted by an NAIC task force on June 30, 2014 and by an NAIC executive committee on August 17, 2014. As a result, a number of NAIC working groups have adopted and may continue to adopt additional regulations on captives. It is premature to project the impact, if any, of any such regulations on MetLife. 
  Like many life insurance companies, we utilize captive reinsurers to satisfy reserve and capital requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies. Insurance regulators in a few states, including New York and California, have imposed a moratorium on new reinsurance transactions between life insurers domiciled in those states and captive reinsurers. We will continue to evaluate product modifications, pricing structure and alternative means of managing risks, capital and statutory reserves. We expect the discontinued use of captive reinsurance on new reserve financing transactions would not have a material impact on our future consolidated financial results. See  Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.  As a result of the Mergers, we no longer cede any U.S. variable annuity guarantee risks to a captive reinsurer. Instead, our reinsured U.S. variable annuity risks that were previously reinsured by captives are now reinsured by MLIC, MetLife USA, or third parties. For more information on our use of captive reinsurers see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Capital   Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions  and Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   The International Association of Insurance Supervisors ( IAIS ) has encouraged U.S. insurance supervisors, such as the Department of Financial Services, to establish Supervisory Colleges for U.S.-based insurance groups with international operations, including MetLife, to facilitate cooperation and coordination among the insurance groups  supervisors and to enhance the member regulators  understanding of an insurance group s risk profile. MetLife, Inc. was the subject of Supervisory College meetings in prior years chaired by the Department of Financial Services and attended by MetLife s key U.S. and international insurance regulators. Because MetLife, Inc. is now supervised as a non-bank SIFI, an April 2015 Supervisory College was co-chaired by the Department of Financial Services and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and attended by MetLife s key U.S. and international regulators, including the FDIC, which has joint authority with the Federal Reserve Board over the resolution plan that MetLife will be required to submit. The next meeting is scheduled for June 2016 and will be chaired by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. See    Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI   Enhanced Prudential Standards for Non-Bank SIFIs  below. We have not received any reports or recommendations from the Supervisory College meetings, and we do not expect any outcome of the meetings to have a material adverse effect on our business.  
    Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis 
  Annually, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated captive reinsurers, are required to conduct an analysis of the adequacy of all statutory reserves. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion which states that the statutory reserves make adequate provision, according to accepted actuarial standards of practice, for the anticipated cash flows required by the contractual obligations and related expenses of the U.S. insurance subsidiary. The adequacy of the statutory reserves is considered in light of the assets held by the insurer with respect to such reserves and related actuarial items including, but not limited to, the investment earnings on such assets, and the consideration anticipated to be received and retained under the related policies and contracts. The Company may increase reserves in order to submit an opinion without qualification. Since inception of this requirement, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries which are required by their states of domicile to provide these opinions have provided such opinions without qualifications. 
    NAIC 
  The NAIC is an organization, the mission of which is to assist state insurance regulatory authorities in serving the public interest and achieving the insurance regulatory goals of its members, the state insurance regulatory officials. Through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer reviews, and coordinate their regulatory oversight. The NAIC provides standardized insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance through its Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (the  Manual ). However, statutory accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws, regulations and permitted practices. Changes to the Manual or modifications by the various state insurance departments may impact the statutory capital and surplus of MetLife, Inc. s U.S. insurance subsidiaries. 
  The Model Holding Company Act and Regulation include a new requirement that the ultimate controlling person of a U.S. insurer file an annual enterprise risk report with the lead state of the insurer identifying risks likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. To date, all of the states where MetLife has domestic insurers have enacted a version of the revised Model Holding Company Act, including the enterprise risk reporting requirement. In December 2014, the NAIC adopted amendments to the Model Holding Company Act that would authorize state insurance commissioners to act as global group-wide supervisors for internationally active insurance groups, as well as other insurers who choose to opt in for the group-wide supervision. The amendments create a selection process for the group-wide supervisor, extend confidentiality protection to communications with the group-wide supervisor, and outline the duties of the group-wide supervisor. To date, a number of jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations enhancing group-wide supervision. 
  The NAIC has concluded its  Solvency Modernization Initiative,  which was designed to review the U.S. financial regulatory system and all aspects of financial regulation affecting insurance companies. Though broad in scope, the NAIC s Solvency Modernization Initiative focused on: (1) capital requirements; (2) corporate governance and risk management; (3) group supervision; (4) statutory accounting and financial reporting; and (5) reinsurance. In furtherance of this initiative, the NAIC adopted the Corporate Governance Annual Filing Model Act and Regulation at its August 2014 meeting. The new model, which requires insurers to make an annual confidential filing regarding their corporate governance policies, is expected to become effective in 2016. In addition, in September 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act ( ORSA ), which has been enacted by our insurance subsidiaries  domiciliary states. ORSA requires that insurers maintain a risk management framework and conduct an internal own risk and solvency assessment of the insurer s material risks in normal and stressed environments. The assessment must be documented in a confidential annual summary report, a copy of which must be made available to regulators as required or upon request. MetLife s first ORSA summary report was submitted on behalf of the enterprise in December 2015.

     Table of Contents  

   In December 2012, the NAIC approved a new valuation manual containing a principles-based approach to life insurance company reserves. Principles-based reserving is designed to better address reserving for products, including the current generation of products for which the current formulaic basis for reserve determination does not work effectively. The principles-based approach will not become effective unless it is enacted into law by a minimum number of state legislatures. Insurance commissioners of certain states (e.g., New York) oppose or do not actively support the principles-based reserve approach. 
  We cannot predict the capital and reserve impacts or compliance costs, if any, that may result from the above initiatives. 
    Surplus and Capital; Risk-Based Capital 
  Insurers are required to maintain their capital and surplus at or above minimum levels. Regulators have discretionary authority, in connection with the continued licensing of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit an insurer s sales to policyholders if, in their judgment, the regulators determine that such insurer has not maintained the minimum surplus or capital or that the further transaction of business will be hazardous to policyholders. Most of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital ( RBC ) requirements. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer and is calculated on an annual basis. The major categories of risk involved are asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk. The formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of each of our subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels. See  Statutory Equity and Income  in Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Capital   Statutory Capital and Dividends.  
  While not required by or filed with insurance regulators, we calculate internally defined combined RBC ratios ( Combined RBC Ratios ), which are determined by dividing the sum of total adjusted capital for MetLife, Inc. s principal U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life Insurance Company ( American Life ), by the sum of company action level RBC for such subsidiaries. We calculate Combined RBC Ratios based on NAIC capital and reserving requirements ( NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratios ). We also calculate Combined RBC Ratios derived from the statutory-basis financial statements as filed with insurance regulators ( Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratios ), which include additional capital requirements as required by the Department of Financial Services for the Company s New York domiciled insurance subsidiaries.  
  Our NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratios were 537% and 437% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratios were 513% and 398% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Higher total adjusted capital coupled with lower company action level RBC resulted in an increase of 100 points in the NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio at December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and contributed to the increase of 115 points in the Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio at December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. In addition, the reserve relief from the Department of Financial Services discussed below also contributed to this increase in the Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio.  
  Combined statutory net income of MetLife, Inc. s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life, was $3.2 billion (see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and $2.3 billion on a statement-basis and NAIC-basis, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. In both cases, statutory net income was the primary driver of the increase in total adjusted capital. In addition, statutory net income on a statement-basis benefited from the release of asset adequacy reserves at MLIC as discussed below. This was partially offset by an increase in reserves at MetLife USA. Also, on February 24, 2016, MetLife, Inc. paid a cash capital contribution of $1.5 billion to MetLife USA, which is included in MetLife USA statutory capital as of December 31, 2015 and also increased total adjusted capital. This capital contribution was made in contemplation of the proposed Separation. See Note 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The additional MetLife USA capital was not required to meet any regulatory solvency or liquidity targets but rather is intended to support the anticipated standalone ratings of the insurance subsidiaries of the new company. This net increase in total adjusted capital was partially offset by dividends to MetLife, Inc. and unrealized investment losses of $2.3 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.

   Benefits from the shifting of the investment portfolio to asset classes with lower risk charges resulted in lower company action level RBC. This was coupled with lower market risk charges on variable annuity reserves, since in 2015 reserves were increased sufficiently to cover this market risk charge to RBC. 
  In addition to the aforementioned drivers of the increase in the NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio, the increase in the Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratios of 115 points was driven by Department of Financial Services Special Considerations Letters (each, an  SCL ) in 2015 and 2014, which lowered MLIC s statement-based statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2015 and 2014 by $0.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, compared to NAIC-based statutory capital and surplus. The 2015 SCL provided meaningful relief to MLIC as compared to the 2014 SCL as it included, among other things, a provision that allowed insurers to seek approval to aggregate the results of their life, annuity and health businesses to satisfy asset adequacy testing requirements. This enabled MLIC to release asset adequacy reserves for long-term care and market value adjusted annuities of $0.7 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and to avoid an estimated additional $0.3 billion of reserve strengthening that would have been required at December 31, 2015. 
  Effective December 31, 2013, the Department of Financial Services discontinued its most recent amendment to Regulation 147 which governed the valuation of life insurance policies. The amendment reflected changes made in 2013 by the NAIC to Actuarial Guideline 38 (which impacts the valuation of universal and variable life policies with secondary guarantees ( ULSG )). As a result of this action, New York licensed insurers are required to comply with a prior version of the regulation. As of December 31, 2015, statutory reserves on in-force ULSG, net of reinsurance, exceed NAIC requirements by $103 million for MLIC and $26 million for MetLife Reinsurance Company of Vermont ( MRV ). The change in the regulation has a minimal reserve impact on new sales of ULSG products.  
  We are not aware of any NAIC adoptions that would have a material impact on the RBC of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. 
    Regulation of Investments 
  Each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed income securities, real estate equity, other equity investments, and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus and, in some instances, would require divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. We believe that the investments made by each of MetLife, Inc. s U.S. insurance subsidiaries complied, in all material respects, with such regulations at December 31,   2015  .  
    Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI 
  On December 18, 2014, the FSOC designated MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. See    Enhanced Prudential Standards for Non-Bank SIFIs.  
  On January 13, 2015, MetLife, Inc. filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia asking the court to review and rescind the FSOC s designation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI. The court held oral argument on the parties  cross motions for summary judgment on February 10, 2016. On January 12, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced its plan to pursue the Separation. See Note   23   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also  Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth   U.S Regulation   Regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a Non-Bank SIFI  regarding the potential impact of the proposed Separation on MetLife, Inc. s or the new company s status as a non-bank SIFI. 
  Regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI could materially and adversely affect our business. For example, although the Federal Reserve Board has not yet determined the enhanced capital requirements that will apply to MetLife, those capital requirements may adversely affect our ability to compete with other insurers that are not subject to those requirements, and our ability to issue guarantees could be constrained. In addition, as a non-bank SIFI, MetLife, Inc. needs to obtain Federal Reserve approval before directly or indirectly acquiring, merging or consolidating with a financial company having more than $10 billion of assets or acquiring 5% or more of any voting class of securities of a bank or bank holding company and, depending on the extent of the combined company s liabilities, is subject to additional restrictions regarding its ability to merge. The Federal Reserve also has the right to require any of our insurance companies, or insurance company affiliates, to take prompt action to correct any financial weaknesses.

     Table of Contents  

   Together with other non-bank SIFIs, MetLife, Inc. is subject to a number of Dodd-Frank requirements including responsibility to pay certain assessments and other charges (i) equal to the total expenses the Federal Reserve Board thinks is necessary for its supervision of bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, and non-bank SIFIs, and (ii) in connection with the Financial Research Fund within the U.S. Department of Treasury that funds the Office of Financial Research, an agency established by Dodd-Frank to improve the quality of financial data available to policymakers and facilitate more robust and sophisticated analysis of the financial system. 
    Enhanced Prudential Standards for Non-Bank SIFIs 
  In December 2011, in accordance with Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve Board proposed a rule that would have applied a set of prudential standards to non-bank SIFIs, including enhanced RBC requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, single counterparty exposure limits, governance requirements for risk management, stress test requirements, special debt-to-equity limits for certain companies, and early remediation procedures. While the final rule did not apply to non-bank SIFIs, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it plans to apply enhanced prudential standards to non-bank SIFIs by rule or order, enabling it to more appropriately tailor the standards to non-bank SIFIs and will provide affected non-bank SIFIs with notice and the opportunity to comment prior to determination of their enhanced prudential standards. Accordingly, the manner in which these proposed standards might apply to MetLife, Inc. remains unclear. 
  In particular, the Federal Reserve Board has not determined the requirements that will govern the amount and composition of capital that MetLife, Inc. is required to hold. Legislation was signed into law on December 18, 2014 relieving the Federal Reserve Board from certain provisions in Dodd-Frank that it believed constrained its ability to tailor capital rules for insurers that are non-bank SIFIs. See  Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth   U.S. Regulation   Regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a Non-Bank SIFI.  On September 30, 2014, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it would begin a quantitative impact study ( QIS ) to evaluate the potential effects of its revised regulatory capital framework on savings and loan holding companies and non-bank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting activity (insurance holding companies). The Federal Reserve Board conducted the QIS in order to enable it to design a capital framework for insurance holding companies it supervises; however, because the QIS was designed prior to the December 18, 2014 statutory change, the Federal Reserve has said the data collected has limitations and that they may seek additional data in the future. MetLife, Inc. voluntarily participated in the QIS. 
  Stress testing requirements have been implemented, which will, once capital requirements for non-bank SIFIs are determined, require non-bank SIFIs to undergo three stress tests each year: an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve and two company-run stress tests (an annual test which coincides with the timing of the supervisory stress test, and a mid-cycle test). Companies will be required to take the results of the stress tests into consideration in their annual capital planning and resolution and recovery planning. As a non-bank SIFI, MetLife, Inc. s competitive position and its ability to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities or engage in other transactions that could affect its capital or need for capital could be adversely affected by any additional capital requirements that might be imposed as a result of the stress testing requirements, as well as enhanced prudential standards, other measures imposed as a result of the enactment of Dodd-Frank and other regulatory initiatives. 
  Non-bank SIFIs are required to submit a resolution plan setting forth how the company could be resolved under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress. Resolution plans have to be resubmitted annually and promptly following any event, occurrence, change in conditions or circumstances, or other change that results in, or could reasonably be foreseen to have, a material effect on the resolution plan. A failure to submit a  credible  resolution plan could result in the imposition of a variety of measures, including additional capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, and forced divestiture of assets or operations. As a non-bank SIFI, MetLife, Inc. will be required to submit a resolution plan by December 31, 2016, unless the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC require a different due date. 
  In addition, if it were determined that MetLife, Inc. posed a substantial threat to U.S. financial stability, the applicable federal regulators would have the right to require it to take one or more other mitigating actions to reduce that risk, including limiting its ability to merge with or acquire another company, terminating activities, restricting its ability to offer financial products or requiring it to sell assets or off-balance sheet items to unaffiliated entities. Enhanced standards would also permit, but not require, regulators to establish requirements with respect to contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures and short-term debt limits. These standards are described as being more stringent than those otherwise imposed on bank holding companies; however, the Federal Reserve is permitted to apply them on an institution-by-institution basis, depending on its determination of the institution s level of risk.

   Orderly Liquidation Authority 
  Under the provisions of Dodd-Frank relating to the resolution or liquidation of certain types of financial institutions, if MetLife, Inc. or another financial institution were to become insolvent or were in danger of defaulting on its obligations, it could be compelled to undergo liquidation with the FDIC as receiver. For this new regime to be applicable, a number of determinations would have to be made, including that a default by the affected company would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the U.S. While under this new regime an insurance company would be resolved in accordance with state insurance law, if the FDIC were to be appointed as the receiver for another type of company (including an insurance holding company such as MetLife, Inc.), the liquidation of that company would occur under the provisions of the new liquidation authority, and not under the Bankruptcy Code, which ordinarily governs liquidations. The FDIC s purpose under the liquidation regime is to mitigate the systemic risks the institution s failure poses, which is different from that of a bankruptcy trustee under the Bankruptcy Code. In such a liquidation, the holders of such company s debt could in certain respects be treated differently than under the Bankruptcy Code. As required by Dodd-Frank, the FDIC has established rules relating to the priority of creditors  claims and the potentially dissimilar treatment of similarly situated creditors. These provisions could apply to some financial institutions whose outstanding debt securities we hold in our investment portfolios. Dodd-Frank also provides for the assessment of bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, non-bank SIFIs, and other financial companies with assets of $50 billion or more, to cover the costs of liquidating any financial company subject to the new liquidation authority. 
    Volcker Rule 
  Under the Volcker Rule, Dodd-Frank authorizes through rulemaking additional capital requirements and quantitative limits on proprietary trading and sponsoring or investing in funds (hedge funds and private equity funds) that rely on certain exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  Investment Company Act ), by a non-bank SIFI. Regulations defining and governing such requirements and limits on non-bank SIFIs have not been proposed and were not addressed in the final regulations issued on December 10, 2013 implementing the Volcker Rule for insured depository institutions and their affiliates ( Volcker Rule Regulations ). After designation as a non-bank SIFI, a non-bank SIFI will have a two-year period, subject to further extension by the Federal Reserve Board, to conform to any such requirements and limits that may be set forth in final regulations applicable to non-bank SIFIs. Subject to safety and soundness determinations as part of rulemaking that could require additional capital requirements and quantitative limits, Dodd-Frank provides that the exemptions under the Volcker Rule also are available to exempt any additional capital requirements and quantitative limits on non-bank SIFIs. The Volcker Rule Regulations provide an exemption, subject to certain requirements, for trading activities and fund sponsorship and investments by a regulated insurance company and its affiliates solely for the general account or separate account of such insurance company. Until final regulations applicable to non-bank SIFIs have been promulgated, it is unclear whether MetLife, Inc., as a non-bank SIFI, may have to alter any of its future activities to comply. 
    ERISA Considerations 
  We provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). As such, our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by the Department of Labor ( DOL ), the Internal Revenue Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 
  The prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to ERISA plans and participants and Individual Retirement Accounts ( IRAs ) if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to the individual advisor, his or her firm or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen.  
  The DOL proposed new regulations in April 2015 that would substantially expand the definition of  investment advice  and thereby broaden the circumstances under which MetLife, in providing investment advice with respect to ERISA plans, plan participants or IRAs, could be deemed a fiduciary under ERISA or the Code. Pursuant to the proposal, any communications with plans, plan participants and IRA holders, including the marketing of products, and marketing of investment management or advisory services, could be deemed fiduciary investment advice, thus, causing increased exposure to fiduciary liability. The DOL also proposed amendments to its prohibited transaction exemptions, and proposed a new exemption, that would apply more onerous disclosure and contract requirements to, and increase fiduciary requirements and fiduciary liability exposure in respect of, transactions involving ERISA plans, plan participants and IRAs.  
    30 

     Table of Contents  

   If the new DOL proposals become final, MetLife may find it necessary to change sales representative and/or broker compensation and may limit the assistance or advice they can provide. Sales to middle income investors would be unlikely to generate fees sufficient to offset the increased cost of providing advice under the rules, if adopted as proposed. Under the rules as proposed, MetLife could reduce its risk of exposure to fiduciary liability by electing not to engage in the concurrent manufacturing and distribution of certain products, including individual annuity products. Further, if the proposed rules apply to welfare benefit plans, they will disrupt settled practices in the marketing and sales of welfare benefit plan insurance products. 
  In addition, the DOL has issued a number of regulations that increase the level of disclosure that must be provided to plan sponsors and participants. The participant disclosure regulations and the regulations which require service providers to disclose fee and other information to plan sponsors took effect in 2012. In     John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank     (1993), the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain assets in excess of amounts necessary to satisfy guaranteed obligations under a participating group annuity general account contract are  plan assets.  Therefore, these assets are subject to certain fiduciary obligations under ERISA, which requires fiduciaries to perform their duties solely in the interest of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries. On January 5, 2000, the Secretary of Labor issued final regulations indicating, in cases where an insurer has issued a policy backed by the insurer s general account to or for an employee benefit plan, the extent to which assets of the insurer constitute plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. The regulations apply only with respect to a policy issued by an insurer on or before December 31, 1998 ( Transition Policy ). No person will generally be liable under ERISA or the Code for conduct occurring prior to July 5, 2001, where the basis of a claim is that insurance company general account assets constitute plan assets. An insurer issuing a new policy that is backed by its general account and is issued to or for an employee benefit plan after December 31, 1998 will generally be subject to fiduciary obligations under ERISA, unless the policy is a guaranteed benefit policy. 
  The regulations indicate the requirements that must be met so that assets supporting a Transition Policy will not be considered plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. These requirements include detailed disclosures to be made to the employee benefits plan and the requirement that the insurer must permit the policyholder to terminate the policy on 90 days  notice and receive without penalty, at the policyholder s option, either (i) the unallocated accumulated fund balance (which may be subject to market value adjustment) or (ii) a book value payment of such amount in annual installments with interest. We have taken and continue to take steps designed to ensure compliance with these regulations. 
    Consumer Protection Laws 
  Numerous federal and state laws affect MetLife, Inc. s earnings and activities, including federal and state consumer protection laws. As part of Dodd-Frank, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services subject to the CFPB s jurisdiction generally exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB does have authority to regulate non-insurance consumer services we provide. 
  In August 2013, MetLife Bank, National Association ( MetLife Bank ) merged with and into MetLife Home Loans LLC ( MLHL ), its former subsidiary, with MLHL as the surviving, non-bank entity. The sole purpose of MLHL is to wind-down the limited remaining activities and fulfill remaining obligations and duties of MetLife Bank, some of which subject MLHL to certain federal consumer financial protection laws and certain state laws.

   Regulation of Over-the-Counter Derivatives 
  Dodd-Frank includes a framework of regulation of the over-the-counter ( OTC ) derivatives markets which requires clearing of certain types of transactions currently traded OTC and imposes additional costs, including new reporting and margin requirements, and will likely impose additional regulation on the Company, including new capital requirements. Our costs of risk mitigation are increasing under Dodd-Frank. For example, Dodd-Frank imposes requirements, including the requirement to pledge initial margin (i) for  OTC-cleared  transactions (OTC derivatives that are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties) entered into after June 10, 2013, and (ii) for  OTC-bilateral  transactions (OTC derivatives that are bilateral contracts between two counterparties) entered into after the phase-in period; these requirements will be applicable to us in 2020 because the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the  OCC ), the Federal Reserve Board, FDIC, Farm Credit Administration and Federal Housing Finance Agency (collectively, the  Prudential Regulators ) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) adopted final margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives during the fourth quarter of 2015, which are broadly consistent with the requirements published by the Bank of International Settlements and International Organization of Securities. These increased margin requirements, combined with increased capital charges for our counterparties and central clearinghouses to hold non-cash collateral, will require increased holdings of cash and highly liquid securities with lower yields causing a reduction in income. Centralized clearing of certain OTC derivatives exposes us to the risk of a default by a clearing member or clearinghouse with respect to our cleared derivative transactions. We use derivatives to mitigate a wide range of risks in connection with our businesses, including the impact of increased benefit exposures from certain of our annuity products that offer guaranteed benefits. We have always been subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures might prove ineffective in reducing the risks to which insurance policies expose us or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, could produce economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed. Any such losses could be increased by higher costs of writing derivatives (including customized derivatives) and the reduced availability of customized derivatives that might result from the implementation of Dodd-Frank and comparable international derivatives regulations. 
  Dodd-Frank also expanded the definition of  swap  and mandated the SEC and CFTC (collectively, the  Commissions ) to study whether  stable value contracts  should be treated as swaps. Pursuant to the new definition and the Commissions  interpretive regulations, products offered by our insurance subsidiaries other than stable value contracts might also be treated as swaps, even though we believe otherwise. Should such products become regulated as swaps, we cannot predict how the rules would be applied to them or the effect on such products  profitability or attractiveness to our clients.  
    Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation 
  Some of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the SEC. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act. Each registered separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by these registered separate accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933. Other subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), and are members of, and subject to regulation by, FINRA. Further, some of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and are also registered as investment advisers in various states, as applicable. Certain variable contract separate accounts sponsored by our subsidiaries are exempt from registration, but may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities laws. 
  Federal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations regarding compliance by MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries with securities and other laws and regulations. We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted. 
  Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets and generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. We may also be subject to similar laws and regulations in the foreign countries in which we provide investment advisory services, offer products similar to those described above, or conduct other activities.

   Environmental Considerations 
  As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Inherent in such ownership and operation is also the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any required remediation of such properties. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities. We routinely have environmental assessments performed with respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real property to be acquired through foreclosure. We cannot provide assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not arise. However, based on information currently available to us, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of such properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
    Unclaimed Property  
  We are subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. See Note   21   of the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    International Regulation  
  Regulation of our insurance operations outside of the U.S. includes minimum capital, solvency and operational requirements. The authority of our international operations to conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, permits and approvals, and these authorizations are subject to modification and revocation. Periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements are among the techniques used by regulators to supervise our non-U.S. insurance businesses. We also have investment and pension companies in certain foreign jurisdictions that provide mutual fund, pension and other financial products and services. Those entities are subject to securities, investment, pension and other laws and regulations. In some jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered  securities  under local law and may be subject to local securities regulations and oversight by local securities regulators. 
  Our international operations are exposed to increased political, legal, financial, operational and other risks. See  Risk Factors   Risks Related to Our Business   Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability  and  Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.  Changes in the laws and regulations that affect our customers and independent sales intermediaries or their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Such actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions. For example, a new tax on assets in Poland became effective on January 1, 2016. This legislation applies to insurers, banks and branches of foreign banks and insurers. We expect this legislation to have a negative impact on our business in Poland, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our overall business. In addition, a tax reform bill was enacted in Chile on September 29, 2014 which includes, among other things, a gradual increase in the corporate tax rate from 20% to 27%, with a taxpayer election that limits the corporate tax rate to 25% but eliminates the taxable profits fund, an exemption on taxes on corporate income that is reinvested. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Results of Operations   Segment Results and Corporate   Other   EMEA  for a discussion of a write-down of deferred policy acquisition costs ( DAC ) and value of business acquired ( VOBA ) associated with our EMEA business and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Results of Operations   Segment Results and Corporate   Other   Latin America  for information regarding the impact on our Latin America business of this tax legislation in Chile. Also pending in Chile are changes to its pension system: a bill to create a state-owned pension company was introduced and a Presidential Advisory Committee was created to draft a reform proposal of the pension system. The committee issued a series of recommendations in September 2015, but the reform proposal has not been finalized and may still change further if a bill results from their recommendations. It is premature to predict the impact of such reforms on our pension business in Chile. 
  Part of our international insurance operations may be subject to assessments, generally based on their proportionate share of business written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations to policyholders and claimants resulting from the insolvency of insurance companies. See   Japan.  Annually, many of our international insurance operations are required to conduct an analysis of the sufficiency of all statutory reserves. In most of those cases, a locally qualified actuary must submit an analysis of the likelihood that the reserves make good and sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. Local regulatory and actuarial standards for this vary widely; the required implied certainty of the signing actuary s opinion varies equally widely. 
    33 

     Table of Contents  

   We expect the scope and extent of regulation outside of the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight, generally, to continue to increase. The regulatory environment in the countries in which we operate and changes in laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  
    Solvency Regimes 
    Solvency II 
  Our insurance business throughout the European Economic Area ( EEA ) is subject to Solvency II, which consists of two inter-linked directives: Solvency II and Omnibus II. Solvency II was adopted by European authorities in 2009. It codifies and harmonizes regulation for insurance undertakings established in the European Union ( EU ). It provides a framework for new risk management practices, solvency capital standards and disclosure requirements. Omnibus II, amending Solvency II, was adopted in April 2014. It contains provisions that adapt Solvency II to the new supervisory architecture establishing the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority ( EIOPA ) and includes a package of measures to facilitate the provision of insurance products with long-term guarantees. Both directives became effective on January 1, 2016. 
  Leading up to Solvency II s effective date, EIOPA published Interim Guidelines aimed at increasing preparedness of both supervisors and insurers. The Interim Guidelines were applicable since January 1, 2014 and included certain reporting and organizational requirements with which we have complied in accordance with the requirements of our local regulators. Leading up to the effective date of both directives in 2016, the European authorities continued to establish supporting rules and guidance that implemented the legislation. Our operations within the EEA are prepared to comply with such requirements.  
    Other Solvency Regimes 
  Our insurance business in Mexico will be impacted by Mexico s insurance law reform, adopted in February 2013. The reform, which became fully effective on January 1, 2016, envisions a Solvency II-type regulatory framework, instituting changes to reserve and capital requirements and corporate governance and fostering greater transparency.  
  In Chile, the law implementing Solvency II-like regulation is currently in the studies stage. However, the Chilean insurance regulator has already issued two resolutions, one for governance, and the other for risk management and control framework requirements. MetLife Chile has already implemented governance changes and risk policies to comply with these resolutions. In January 2015, the regulator requested an impact study considering the third draft of the regulation for RBC requirements which was submitted in May 2015. In November 2015, the local regulator issued a draft regulation which requires Insurance undertakings to implement a risk appetite framework and produce an  Own Risk and Solvency Assessment.  A fourth impact study will be performed during 2016. The new solvency and supervisory regime is expected to be in force in 2017.  
  In China, the business of our joint venture (as well as the industry) will be impacted by China Risk Oriented Solvency System ( C-ROSS ), a new risk-based solvency regime. Like Solvency II, C-ROSS focuses on risk management and has three pillars (strengthen quantitative capital requirements, enhance qualitative supervision and establish a governance and market discipline process). China Insurance Regulatory Commission announced on January 26, 2016 that C-ROSS became effective as of January 1, 2016. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, after one year s parallel run of both old solvency and C-ROSS calculations, C-ROSS solvency will become the mandated reporting for the industry.  
    Global Systemically Important Insurers 
  The IAIS, an association of insurance supervisors and regulators and a member of the Financial Stability Board ( FSB ), and an international entity established to coordinate, develop and promote regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability, is participating in the FSB s initiative to identify and manage global systemically important financial institutions. The IAIS has published a methodology to assess the systemic relevance of global insurers and a framework of policy measures to be applied to G-SIIs and, on this basis, the FSB again so designated MetLife, Inc. The FSB will continue to update the list annually. The IAIS plans to evaluate and, if necessary, update the assessment methodology every three years. 
    34 

     Table of Contents  

   Current standards call for G-SIIs to be subject to higher loss absorbency requirements ( HLA ). Given the absence of a common global base on which to calculate HLA for insurers, the FSB directed the IAIS to develop basic capital requirements ( BCR ). The first version of the IAIS HLA framework was endorsed by the FSB and the G20 in September and November 2015, respectively. This first version applies specified factors to exposures of BCR components with an emphasis on non-traditional and non-insurance activities. G-SIIs will begin reporting BCR and HLA results to their group-wide supervisors as of June 2016 on a confidential basis to allow for refinement of the BCR and HLA until fully adopted and implemented in 2019. The FSB endorsed the first version of HLA, noting that further revision will be necessary before implementation to reflect ongoing work on the G-SII assessment methodology and the definition of non-traditional and non-insurance activity. In November 2015, the IAIS published consultations for stakeholder comment on both topics. MetLife submitted comments in January 2016. The IAIS plans to incorporate any changes to the assessment methodology in the 2016 G-SII assessment update. 
  In addition, on December 17, 2014, the IAIS released a first exposure draft of a risk-based global insurance capital standard ( ICS ) which will apply to all internationally active insurance groups, including G-SIIs. A second exposure draft is scheduled to be published for comment in June 2016. The IAIS expects to publish an interim version of the ICS by the end of 2019 for implementation by individual jurisdictions with the further goal of reaching an ultimate ICS at some later date. 
  The FSB and IAIS propose that national authorities consider additional requirements for G-SIIs, which include preparation of a systemic risk management plan, preparation of a recovery and resolution plan, enhanced liquidity planning and management, more intensive supervision, closer coordination among regulators through global supervisory colleges led by a regulator with group-wide supervisory authority, and a policy bias in favor of separation of non-traditional insurance and non-insurance activities from traditional insurance activities. The IAIS proposals would need to be implemented by legislation or regulation in each applicable jurisdiction, and the impact on MetLife, Inc. of such proposals is uncertain. 
    Japan 
  Our operations in Japan are subject to regulation and examination by Japan s Financial Services Agency ( FSA ). Our operations in Japan are required to file with the FSA annual reports for each fiscal year (ending March 31) which include financial statements. These annual reports are not prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Similar to the U.S., Japanese law provides that insurers in Japan must maintain specified solvency standards for the protection of policyholders and to support the financial strength of licensed insurers. As of December 31, 2015, the date of our most recent regulatory filing in Japan, the solvency margin ratio of our Japan operations was in excess of four times the 200% solvency margin ratio that would require corrective action. Most Japanese life insurers maintain a solvency margin ratio well in excess of the legally mandated minimum. 
  A portion of the annual earnings of our Japan operations may be repatriated each year, and may further be distributed to MetLife, Inc. as a dividend. We may determine not to repatriate profits from the Japan operations or to repatriate a reduced amount in order to maintain or improve the solvency margin of the Japan operations or for other reasons. In addition, the FSA may limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers would be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of our Japan operations or for other reasons. 
  Our operations in Japan are subject to assessments to cover obligations to policyholders in the event of insolvency of other insurance companies. Under the Japanese Insurance Business Law, all licensed life insurers in Japan are assessed on an annual basis by the Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation of Japan. These assessments are aggregated across all licensed life insurers in Japan and, in the event of a life insurance company insolvency, are used to satisfy certain obligations to policyholders and claimants of such insolvent company.  
    Company Ratings 
  Insurer financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies, including A.M. Best Company ( A.M. Best ), Fitch Ratings ( Fitch ), Moody s Investors Service ( Moody s ) and Standard   Poor s Ratings Services ( S P ), regarding the ability of an insurance company to meet its financial obligations to policyholders and contractholders. 
    Rating Stability Indicators  
  Rating agencies use an  outlook statement  of  positive,   stable,    negative   or  developing  to indicate a medium- or long-term trend in credit fundamentals which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A rating may have a  stable  outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change; however, a  stable  rating does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time, without notice. Certain rating agencies assign rating modifiers such as  CreditWatch  or  under review  to indicate their opinion regarding the potential direction of a rating. These ratings modifiers are generally assigned in connection with certain events such as potential mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or material changes in a company s results, in order for the rating agency to perform its analysis to fully determine the rating implications of the event.

   Competition 
  We believe that competition faced by our segments is based on a number of factors, including service, product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition. We compete globally with a large number of other insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for individual consumers, employer and other group customers, as well as agents and other distributors of insurance and investment products. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability ratings. In the U.S. and Japan, we compete with a large number of domestic and foreign-owned life insurance companies, many of which offer products in categories on which we focus. Elsewhere, we compete with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies in particular areas in which they are active. Many of our group insurance products are underwritten annually and, accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than renewing coverage with us. 
  We believe that the continued volatility of the financial markets, its impact on the capital position of many competitors, and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have altered the competitive environment. In particular, we believe that these factors have highlighted financial strength as the most significant differentiator from the perspective of some customers and certain distributors. We believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this environment. In particular, the Company distributes many of its individual products through other financial institutions such as banks and broker-dealers. These distribution partners are currently placing greater emphasis on the financial strength of the company whose products they sell. In addition, the financial market turbulence has highlighted the extent of the risk associated with certain variable annuity products and has led us, along with many companies in our industry, to re-examine the pricing and features of the products offered. The effects of current market conditions may also lead to consolidation in the life insurance industry. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these conditions, we believe that the strongest companies will enjoy a competitive advantage as a result of the current circumstances.  
  Competition for employees in our industry is intense, and we need to be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people with knowledge of our business and industry experience to support our business. We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Insurance companies compete for sales representatives with demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurance companies for sales representatives primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services and compensation and product features. See    Segments and Corporate   Other  for information on sales distribution. In selected global markets, we continue to undertake several initiatives to grow our career agency forces, while continuing to enhance the efficiency and production of our sales representatives. These initiatives may not succeed in attracting and retaining productive agents. Sales of individual insurance, annuities and investment products and our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining productive agents. 
  Numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can affect our competitive position within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See    Regulation.  
    Employees 
  At December 31,   2015  , we had approximately 69,000 employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

    Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks 
  If Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally Persist, They May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations 
  Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in financial asset classes or various markets, including global capital markets, can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. Global market factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, real estate markets, foreign currency exchange rates, consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, deflation and inflation, all affect our financial condition, as well as the volume, profitability and results of our business operations, either directly or by virtue of their impact on the business and economic environment generally and on general levels of economic activity, employment and customer behavior specifically. Disruptions in one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes. Upheavals in the financial markets can also affect our financial condition (including our liquidity and capital levels) as a result of mismatched impacts on the value of our assets and our liabilities. While our diversified business mix and geographically diverse business operations partially mitigate these risks, correlation across regions, countries and global market factors may reduce the benefits of diversification.  
  At times throughout the past several years, volatile conditions have characterized financial markets. Significant market volatility, and government actions taken in response, may exacerbate some of the risks we face. Weakness in the energy and     metals and mining sectors     and concerns about the political and/or economic stability of countries in regions outside the EU, including China, Ukraine, Russia, Argentina, Brazil, Japan and the Middle East, as well as Puerto Rico, have contributed to global market volatility. Concerns about global economic conditions, capital markets and the solvency of certain EU member states, their banking systems and the financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by these countries or their respective banking systems, have also been a cause of elevated levels of market volatility. This market volatility has affected the performance of various asset classes at various times, and it could continue until there is an ultimate resolution of these sovereign debt and banking system-related concerns. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Investments   Current Environment  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Financial and Economic Environment.  Any of these factors could have significant adverse effects on the economy and financial markets generally.

     Table of Contents  

   To the extent these uncertain financial market conditions persist, our revenues and net investment income are likely to remain under pressure. Similarly, sustained periods of low interest rates could cause our profit margins to erode. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment.  Also, in the event of extreme prolonged market events, such as the global credit crisis, we could incur significant capital and/or operating losses due to, among other reasons, losses incurred in our general account and as a result of the impact on us of guarantees, capital maintenance obligations and/or collateral requirements associated with our affiliated reinsurers and other similar arrangements. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility, which may also increase the cost and limit the availability of the hedging instruments and other protective measures we take to mitigate such risk. 
  We are a significant writer of variable insurance products and certain other products issued through separate accounts. The account values of these products decrease as a result of declining equity markets. Lower interest rates generally increase account values in the near term, but may result in lower returns in fixed income options in the future. Decreases in account values reduce fees generated by these products, cause the amortization of DAC to accelerate, could increase the level of insurance liabilities we must carry to support such products issued with any associated guarantees and could require us to provide additional funding to our captive reinsurers. 
  In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. Group insurance, in particular, is affected by higher unemployment rates. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Furthermore, our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Such adverse changes in the economy could negatively affect our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  
  Difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may continue to raise the possibility of legislative, judicial, regulatory and other governmental actions. See    Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth,  and    Risks Related to Our Business   Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability  below. 
  Adverse Global Capital and Credit Market Conditions May Significantly Affect Our Ability to Meet Liquidity Needs, Our Access to Capital and Our Cost of Capital 
  The global capital and credit markets may be subject to periods of extreme volatility. Disruptions in capital markets could cause our liquidity and credit capacity to be limited. 
  We need liquidity to pay claims and other operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock, provide our subsidiaries with cash or collateral, maintain our securities lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations, and our business and financial results may suffer. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources.  
  In the event global capital market or other conditions have an adverse impact on our capital and liquidity, or our stress-testing indicates that such conditions could have such an impact beyond expectations and our current resources do not satisfy our needs or regulatory requirements, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as the then current market conditions, regulatory considerations, availability of credit to us and the financial services industry generally, our credit ratings and credit capacity, and the perception of our customers and lenders regarding our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large operating or investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. 
  Our liquidity requirements may change if, among other things, we are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice under securities lending agreements. See    Investments-Related Risks   Should the Need Arise, We May Have Difficulty Selling Certain Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner and Realizing Full Value Given Their Illiquid Nature  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Investments   Securities Lending.

   Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital needed to operate our business, most significantly in our insurance operations. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements, and access the capital necessary to grow our business. See    Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.  As a result, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue different types of securities than we would have otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital, issue shorter tenor securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets. 
  We Are Exposed to Significant Global Financial and Capital Markets Risks Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and May Cause Our Net Investment Income to Vary from Period to Period  
  We are exposed to significant global financial and capital markets risks, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity, oil and commodity prices, real estate markets, foreign currency exchange rates, market volatility, global economic performance in general, the performance of specific obligors, including governments, included in our investment portfolio and other factors outside our control. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Financial and Economic Environment  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Investments   Current Environment.   
  Interest Rate Risk    
  Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance, fixed annuities and guaranteed interest contracts, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our investment margin or  spread,  or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts in our general account and the rate of return we earn on general account investments intended to support obligations under such contracts. Our spread is a key component of our net income.  
  In a low interest rate environment, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, which will reduce our investment margin. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and commercial or agricultural mortgage loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates, thereby exacerbating this risk. Although lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in spreads on some products, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our spread could decrease or potentially become negative. See        Risks Related to Our Business       Guarantees Within Certain of Our Products May Decrease Our Earnings, Increase the Volatility of Our Results, Result in Higher Risk Management Costs and Expose Us to Increased Counterparty Risk.  
  Our expectation for future spreads is an important component in the amortization of DAC and VOBA. Significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. In addition, during periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments to consumers. This could result in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, or a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in-force from year to year, during a period when our new investments carry lower returns. A decline in market interest rates could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, our reserves for policy liabilities may not be sufficient to meet future policy obligations and may need to be strengthened. Accordingly, declining and sustained lower interest rates may materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and significantly reduce our profitability. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Industry Trends       Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment.  
  As a global insurance company, we are also affected by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board and of central banks around the world. Actions resulting from these policies may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments, and may adversely impact the income we earn on our investments or the level of product sales. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Investments       Current Environment.   
    41 

     Table of Contents  

   Increases in interest rates could also negatively affect our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep interest rate sensitive products competitive. We, therefore, may have to accept a lower credit spread and, thus, lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as interest rates rise. This process may result in cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. Unanticipated withdrawals, terminations and substantial policy amendments may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC and VOBA, which reduces net income and may also cause us to accelerate the amortization of negative VOBA, which increases net income. An increase in interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio. Finally, an increase in interest rates could result in decreased fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds. However, this increase in interest rates would typically cause any guaranteed living benefits to decline in value. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Industry Trends       Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment.  
  We manage interest rate risk as part of our asset and liability management strategies, which include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile. We also use derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk. Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our fixed income investments relative to our interest sensitive liabilities. See  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   
  Credit Spreads  
  Our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price volatility and cash flow variability associated with changes in such spreads. Market price volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. In such case, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period-to-period changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. If there is a resumption of significant volatility in the markets, it could cause changes in credit spreads and defaults and a lack of pricing transparency which, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Investments       Investment Risks.  
  Equity Risk  
  Our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our businesses where fee income is earned based upon the estimated fair value of the assets under management. Downturns and volatility in equity markets can have a material adverse effect on the revenues and investment returns from our savings and investment products and services. The retail variable annuity business in particular is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness in the equity markets could decrease revenues and earnings with respect to those products. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefits which increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline. We use derivatives and reinsurance to mitigate the impact of such increased potential benefit exposures. We are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Sustained declines in long-term interest rates or equity returns likely would have a negative effect on the funded status of these plans.  
  In addition, we invest a portion of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds. The amount and timing of net investment income from such funds tends to be uneven as a result of the performance of the underlying investments. The timing of distributions from such funds, which depends on particular events relating to the underlying investments, as well as the funds  schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash, can be difficult to predict. As a result, the amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter. Significant volatility could adversely impact returns and net investment income on these alternative investment classes. In addition, the estimated fair value of such investments may be impacted by downturns or volatility in equity markets. See  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

     Table of Contents  

   Real Estate Risk  
  Our primary exposure to real estate risk relates to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate. Our exposure to these risks stems from various factors, including the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of tenants and partners, capital markets volatility and interest rate fluctuations. Although we manage credit risk and market valuation risk for our commercial, agricultural and residential real estate assets through geographic, property type and product type diversification, and asset allocation, general economic conditions in the commercial, agricultural and residential real estate sectors will continue to influence the performance of these investments. These factors, which are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.  
  Obligor-Related Risks  
  Our investment portfolio contains investments in government bonds issued by certain EU member states and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by these countries. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Investments   Current Environment   Selected Country and Sector Investments.  A number of member states are significantly impacted by the economies of their more influential neighbors and financial troubles of one nation can lead to troubles in others. In particular, a number of large European banks hold significant amounts of sovereign and/or financial institution debt of other European nations and could experience difficulties as a result of defaults or declines in the value of such debt. Concerns regarding these difficulties could disrupt the functioning of the financial markets.  
  Our investment portfolio also contains investments, primarily in revenue bonds issued under the auspices of U.S. states and municipalities, and a limited amount of general obligation bonds of U.S. states and municipalities (collectively,  State and political subdivision securities ). Various U.S. states and municipalities have faced budget deficits and financial difficulties. The financial difficulties of such U.S. states and municipalities could have an adverse impact on our State and political subdivision securities.  
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks  
  Our primary foreign currency exchange rate risks are described under        Risks Related to Our Business       Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our net investment income in any period, and such changes can be substantial. This risk will increase if a country withdraws from the Euro zone. In such case, the national currency to which such a country may revert will likely be devalued and contracts using the Euro will need to be renegotiated. Any such devaluation and its related consequences for our contracts and investments in any such country could be significant and materially adversely affect our operations and earnings in that country. Any operations we may have in any such withdrawing country could also be materially adversely affected by legal or governmental actions related to conversion from the Euro to a national currency. See  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   
  Summary  
  Significant volatility in the markets could cause changes in interest rates, declines in equity prices, and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar which, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows through realized investment losses, impairments, increased valuation allowances and changes in unrealized gain or loss positions. 
    Regulatory and Legal Risks 
  Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth  
   Our insurance operations and brokerage businesses are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. See  Business   Regulation,  as supplemented by discussions of regulatory developments in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Regulatory Developments.

   U.S. Regulation 
  Insurance Regulation 
  State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, can sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, like many life insurance companies, we use captive reinsurers to satisfy reserve and capital requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies. State insurance regulators and the NAIC are investigating the use of affiliated captive reinsurers and offshore entities to reinsure insurance risks and a few states, including New York and California, have imposed a moratorium on new reinsurance transactions between life insurers domiciled in those states and captive reinsurers. See  Business       Regulation       U.S. Regulation       Insurance Regulation       Insurance Regulatory Examinations and Other Activities.  If additional state insurance regulators restrict the use of such captive reinsurers, or if we otherwise are unable to continue to use captive reinsurers in the future, our ability to write certain products and/or our RBC ratios and ability to deploy excess capital, could be adversely affected or we may need to increase prices on those products, which could adversely impact our competitive position and our results of operations. Such restrictions could also affect statutory reserve funding. See        Risks Related to Our Business       Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings May Be Subject to Cost Increases and New Financings May Be Subject to Limited Market Capacity.  
  U.S. Federal Regulation Affecting Insurance 
  Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, Dodd-Frank established the FIO within the Department of the Treasury, which has the authority to participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., as well as to collect information about the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. On December 12, 2013, the FIO     issued a report, mandated by Dodd-Frank, which, among other things, urged the states to modernize and promote greater uniformity in insurance regulation. The report raised the possibility of a greater role for the federal government if states do not achieve greater uniformity in their laws and regulations. We cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulatory changes will be adopted, or what impact they will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See  Business           Regulation           U.S. Regulation           Insurance Regulation           Federal Initiatives.  
  Federal legislation and administrative policies can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies, including policies regarding financial services regulation, securities regulation, derivatives regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies.  
  Regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a Non-Bank SIFI  
  On December 18, 2014, the FSOC designated MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI. As a non-bank SIFI, MetLife, Inc. is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. Many of the regulatory requirements that will apply to us have not been specified. In particular, the Federal Reserve Board has not determined the requirements that will govern the amount and composition of capital that MetLife, Inc. is required to hold. On January 12, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced its plan to pursue the Separation. See Note     23     of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.     No assurance can be given regarding the form that the proposed Separation may take or the specific terms thereof, or that the Separation will in fact occur. Furthermore, t  here can be no assurance that the new company     that would   be created in connection with the Separation will not be designated by the FSOC as a non-bank SIFI or that any actions taken in furtherance of this plan will cause the FSOC to revoke its designation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI. 
  The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it plans to apply enhanced prudential standards to non-bank SIFIs by rule or order. Accordingly, the manner in which these proposed standards might apply to MetLife, Inc. remains unclear. Regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI could materially and adversely affect our business.  
  If the Federal Reserve Board requires insurers that are non-bank SIFIs to comply with capital standards or regimes (such as the Basel capital rules that were developed for banks) that do not take into account the insurance business model and the differences between banks and insurers, our business and competitive position could be materially and adversely affected. The capital requirements that apply to us could also constrain our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities or engage in other transactions that could affect our capital. Enhanced capital requirements could adversely affect our ability to compete with other insurers that are not subject to those requirements, and our ability to issue guarantees could be constrained. We could have to raise the price of the products we offer, reduce the amount of risk we take on, or stop offering certain products altogether. Legislation was signed into law on December 18, 2014 relieving the Federal Reserve Board from certain provisions in Dodd-Frank that it believed constrained its ability to tailor capital rules for insurers that are non-bank SIFIs. 
    44 

     Table of Contents  

   MetLife, Inc. may also be subject to additional prudential standards that the Federal Reserve Board may promulgate for non-bank SIFIs which will likely include leverage limits, liquidity requirements, single counterparty exposure limits, governance requirements for risk management, stress test requirements, special debt-to-equity limits for certain companies, and early remediation procedures. In addition, non-bank SIFIs are required to submit a resolution plan setting forth how the company could be resolved under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress. The Federal Reserve Board also has the right to require any of MetLife, Inc. s insurance companies, or insurance company affiliates, to take prompt action to correct any financial weaknesses. In addition, as a result of our designation as a non-bank SIFI, under the Volcker Rule, we could be subject to the imposition by the Federal Reserve Board of additional capital requirements and quantitative limits on certain of our trading and investment activities.  
  As a non-bank SIFI, we may consider structural and other business alternatives that may be available to us in response to such designation, and we cannot predict the impact that any such alternatives, if implemented, may have on the Company or its security holders.     See Note     23     of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Company s announcement of its plan to pursue the Separation. 
  Together with other non-bank SIFIs and certain other large financial companies, MetLife, Inc. can be assessed under Dodd-Frank for any uncovered costs arising in connection with the resolution of a systemically important financial company. In addition, together with other non-bank SIFIs, MetLife, Inc. must pay certain assessments and other charges to offset certain costs incurred by the Federal Reserve Board in fulfilling its oversight role and in connection with the Financial Research Fund within the U.S. Department of Treasury that funds the Office of Financial Research.  
  See  Business       Regulation       U.S. Regulation       Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI  for additional information regarding regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI. 
  ERISA Considerations 
  We provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA or the Code. As such, our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions. The prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to ERISA plans and participants and IRAs if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to the individual advisor, his or her firm or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen.  
  The DOL proposed new regulations in April 2015 that would substantially expand the definition of  investment advice  and thereby broaden the circumstances under which MetLife, in providing investment advice with respect to ERISA plans, plan participants or IRAs, could be deemed a fiduciary under ERISA or the Code. The DOL also proposed amendments to its prohibited transaction exemptions, and proposed a new exemption that would apply more onerous disclosure and contract requirements to, and increase fiduciary requirements and fiduciary liability exposure in respect of, transactions involving ERISA plans, plan participants and IRAs. If the new DOL proposals become final, MetLife may find it necessary to change sales representative and/or broker compensation and may limit the assistance or advice they can provide. See  Business       Regulation       U.S. Regulation       ERISA Considerations.     
  We cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what legislation may be introduced or enacted or the impact of any such legislation on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Mortgage and Foreclosure-Related Exposure  s 
  State and federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities have initiated various inquiries and investigations of alleged irregularities in the foreclosure practices of the residential mortgage servicing industry, mortgage origination and mortgage servicing practices. Although we have reached settlements with some regulators relating to our mortgage servicing activities and Federal Housing Administration loan origination, pending or additional inquiries, investigations or examinations may result in further monetary payments or other measures against us. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Industry Trends       Mortgage and Foreclosure-Related Exposures.

   International Regulation    
   Our international insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. A significant portion of our revenues is generated through operations in foreign jurisdictions, including many countries in early stages of economic and political development. Our international operations may be materially adversely affected by the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and regulators.   See    Risks Related to Our Business   Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability.    This may also impact many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries. Changes in the laws and regulations that affect these customers and independent sales intermediaries or their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes and actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions. We expect the scope and extent of regulation outside of the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight, generally, to continue to increase. The authority of our international operations to conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, permits and approvals, and these authorizations are subject to modification and revocation. The regulatory environment in the countries in which we operate and changes in laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See  Business       Regulation       International Regulation.  
  Solvency Regimes 
  We are subject to Solvency II (adopted in 2009, effective on January 1, 2016) and Omnibus II (amending Solvency II, adopted in 2014, effective on January 1, 2016), two interlinked insurance regulatory directives that provide a framework for new risk management practices, solvency capital standards and disclosure requirements across our business in the European Economic Area, and may be subject to similar solvency regulations in other regions, such as Mexico, Chile and China. See  Business       Regulation       International Regulation       Solvency Regimes.  As requirements are finalized by the regulators, capital requirements might be impacted in a number of jurisdictions. In addition, our legal entity structure throughout Europe may impact our capital requirements, risk management infrastructure and reporting by country. 
  Global Systemically Important Insurers 
  In the wake of the financial crisis, national and international authorities have proposed measures intended to increase the intensity of regulation of large financial institutions, requiring greater coordination among regulators and efforts to harmonize regulatory regimes. For example, the IAIS is participating in the FSB s initiative to identify and manage global systemically important financial institutions. To this end, the IAIS published a methodology to assess the systemic relevance of global insurers and a framework of policy measures to be applied to G-SIIs and, on this basis, the FSB again so designated MetLife, Inc. While the regulatory standards that would apply to G-SIIs are still being developed, they will include enhanced capital standards and supervision and other additional requirements that would not apply to companies that are not G-SIIs. The IAIS proposals would need to be implemented by legislation or regulation in each applicable jurisdiction, and the impact on MetLife, Inc. of such proposals is uncertain. See  Business           Regulation           International Regulation           Global Systemically Important Insurers.    
  General 
  From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits of MetLife, Inc. s regulated subsidiaries that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. In addition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  The Dodd-Frank Provisions Compelling the Liquidation of Certain Types of Financial Institutions Could Materially and Adversely Affect MetLife, Inc., as Such a Financial Institution and as an Investor in Other Such Financial Institutions, as well as Our Investors  
  Under provisions of Dodd-Frank, if MetLife, Inc. or another financial institution were to become insolvent or were in danger of defaulting on its obligations and it was determined that such default would have serious effects on financial stability in the U.S., it could be compelled to undergo liquidation with the FDIC as receiver.   While under this new regime an insurance company would be resolved in accordance with state insurance law, if   the FDIC were appointed as the receive  r for another type of a company (including an insurance holding company such as MetLife, Inc.),   liquidation of that company would occur under the provisions of the new liquidation authority, and not under the Bankruptcy Code, which ordinarily governs liquidations. In an FDIC-managed liquidation, holders of a company s debt could be treated differently than under the Bankruptcy Code and similarly-situated creditors could be treated differently. In particular, unsecured creditors and shareholders are intended to bear the losses of the company being liquidated. These provisions could also apply to financial institutions whose debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and could adversely affect our position as a creditor and the value of our holdings. 
    46 

     Table of Contents  

   Dodd-Frank also provides for the assessment of charges against certain financial institutions, including non-bank SIFIs and bank holding companies and other financial companies with assets of $50 billion or more, to cover the costs of liquidating any financial company subject to the new liquidation authority. The liquidation authority could increase our funding costs. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI   Orderly Liquidation Authority.  
  Legislative and Regulatory Activity in Health Care and Other Employee Benefits Could Affect our Profitability as a Provider of Life Insurance, Annuities, and Non-Medical Health Insurance Benefit Prod  ucts  
  The Affordable Care Act may lead to fundamental changes in the way that employers, including us, provide health care benefits and other forms of compensation to their employees and former employees. In addition to imposing obligations on MetLife as an enterprise, the Affordable Care Act also imposes requirements on us as a provider of non-medical health insurance benefits and as a purchaser of certain of these products. See  Business   U.S. Regulation   Insurance Regulation   Health Care Regulation  for information regarding such requirements, including the effect of assessments related to public healthcare exchanges. The Affordable Care Act or other related regulations or regulatory actions may adversely affect our ability to continue to offer certain non-medical health and dental insurance products in the same manner as we do today and may continue to result in increased and unpredictable costs to provide certain products thereby harming our competitive position. 
  In addition, we employ a substantial number of employees, including sales agents, in the United States to whom we offer employment-related benefits. We also currently provide benefits to certain of our retirees. These benefits are provided under complex plans that are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements. The Affordable Care Act or related regulations or regulatory actions could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate our associates. They could also result in increased or unpredictable costs to provide employee benefits, and could harm our competitive position if we are subject to fees, penalties, tax provisions or other limitations in the Affordable Care Act and our competitors are not. 
  The Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 also includes certain provisions for defined benefit pension plan funding relief. These provisions may impact the likelihood and/or timing of corporate plan sponsors terminating their plans and/or engaging in transactions to partially or fully transfer pension obligations to an insurance company. Consequently, this legislation could indirectly affect the mix of our business, with fewer pension risk transfers and more non-guaranteed funding products, and adversely impact our results of operations. 
  Changes in U.S. Federal, State Securities and State Insurance Laws and Regulations May Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability 
  Federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to insurance products that are also  securities,  including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. As a result, some of MetLife, Inc. s subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under these securities laws. 
  Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in the securities markets, and to protect investment advisory or brokerage clients. These laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with the securities laws and regulations. A number of changes have recently been proposed or adopted to the laws and regulations that govern the conduct of our variable insurance products business and our distributors. The future impact of recently adopted revisions to laws and regulations, as well as revisions that are still in the proposal stage, on the way we conduct our business and the products we sell is unclear. Such impact could adversely affect our operations and profitability, including increasing the regulatory and compliance burden upon us, resulting in increased costs. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   ERISA Considerations  and  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation.  We also may be subject to similar laws and regulations in the foreign countries in which we offer products or conduct other activities similar to those described above. See  Business   Regulation   International Regulation.  
  Changes in Tax Laws or Interpretations of Such Laws Could Reduce Our Earnings and Materially Impact Our Operations by Increasing Our Corporate Taxes and Making Some of Our Products Less Attractive to Consumers  
  Changes in domestic or foreign tax laws or interpretations of such laws could increase our corporate taxes and reduce our earnings. For example, in the third quarter of 2015, MetLife, Inc. recorded a $792 million after-tax charge, or $.70 per share, under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties as a result of our consideration of recent decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upholding the disallowance of foreign tax credits claimed by other corporate entities not affiliated with us (in transactions different from ours), based upon a changed interpretation of the proper method of determining that a transaction has economic substance. Additionally, global budget deficits make it likely that governments  need for additional revenue will result in future tax proposals that will increase our effective tax rate. However, it remains difficult to predict the timing and effect that future tax law changes could have on our earnings both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions.  
    47 

     Table of Contents  

   Additionally, U.S. tax laws currently afford certain tax treatment to life insurance and annuity products. The Obama Administration and some members of Congress have proposed certain changes to rules applicable to certain of these products and to individual income tax rates in general. Changes in tax laws could make some of our products less attractive to consumers. A shift away from life insurance and annuity contracts and other tax-deferred products by our customers would reduce our income from sales of these products, as well as the asset base upon which we earn investment income and fees, thereby reducing our earnings and potentially affecting the value of our deferred tax assets. Federal budgets have been proposed that would change selected company tax provisions and could adversely impact product affordability and availability. Tax reform proposals have also been made in recent Congresses to modify company tax treatment similar to those in the proposed budgets. These proposals have not advanced. 
  Litigation and Regulatory Investigations Are Increasingly Common in Our Businesses and May Result in Significant Financial Losses and/or Harm to Our Reputation 
  We face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate. In connection with our insurance operations, plaintiffs  lawyers may bring or are bringing class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product design, disclosure, administration, denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages. Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain. Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal. Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law. Material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us and risks to our business presented by these proceedings are discussed in Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Updates are provided in the notes to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as in Part II, Item 1 ( Legal Proceedings ) of those quarterly reports. 
  A substantial legal liability or a significant federal, state or other regulatory action against us, as well as regulatory inquiries or investigations, could harm our reputation, result in material fines or penalties, result in significant legal costs and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, our ability to attract new customers, retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees could be materially and adversely impacted. Regulatory inquiries and litigation may also cause volatility in the price of stocks of companies in our industry. 
  Current claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and other proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that related or unrelated claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future, and we could become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. We currently have a market presence in numerous countries and may be subject to additional investigations and lawsuits in these jurisdictions. Increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings in any of the countries where we operate could result in new legal actions and precedents and industry-wide regulations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    Risks Related to Acquisitions, Dispositions or Other Structural Changes 
  We Could Face Difficulties, Unforeseen Liabilities, Asset Impairments or Rating Actions Arising from Business Acquisitions or Integrating and Managing Growth of Such Businesses, Dispositions of Businesses, or Legal Entity Reorganizations  
  We have engaged in dispositions and acquisitions of businesses in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future. See Note   23   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding MetLife, Inc. s plan to pursue the Separation. Such activity exposes us to a number of risks arising from (i) potential difficulties achieving projected financial results including the costs and benefits of integration or deconsolidation; (ii) unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments; (iii) the scope and duration of rights to indemnification for losses; (iv) the use of capital which could be used for other purposes; (v) rating agency reactions; (vi) regulatory requirements that could impact our operations or capital requirements; (vii) changes in statutory or U.S. GAAP accounting principles, practices or policies; and (viii) certain other risks specifically arising from activities relating to an initial public offering, spin-off, joint venture or legal entity reorganization, including in connection with the proposed Separation.  
    48 

     Table of Contents  

   The valuation and structure for any transaction reflect our financial projections and other qualitative and quantitative factors. Every transaction exposes us to the risk that actual results may materially differ from what we have projected. Factors that can cause our financial projections to vary materially from ultimate experience include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic, business growth, demographic, policyholder behavior, regulatory and political conditions. 
  Risks Relating to Acquisitions 
  Our ability to achieve certain financial benefits we anticipate from any acquisitions of businesses will depend in part upon our ability to successfully integrate such businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to integrate such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may take longer than expected. The integration of operations and differences in operational culture may require the dedication of significant management resources, which may distract management s attention from day-to-day business. If we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of such acquired businesses, we may be unable to realize the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of such acquisitions and our business and results of operations may be less than expected. 
  The success with which we are able to integrate acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage a variety of issues, including the following: 
             
    Loss of key personnel or higher than expected employee attrition rates could adversely affect the performance of the acquired business and our ability to integrate it successfully. 
                
    Customers of the acquired business may reduce, delay or defer decisions concerning their use of its products and services as a result of the acquisition or uncertainty related to the consummation of the acquisition, including, for example, potential unfamiliarity with the MetLife brand in regions where we did not have a market presence prior to the acquisition. 
                
    If the acquired business relies upon independent distributors to distribute its products, these distributors may not continue to generate the same volume of business for us after the acquisition. Independent distributors may reexamine the scope of their relationship with the acquired business or us as a result of the acquisition and decide to curtail or eliminate distribution of our products. 
                
    If the acquired business relies on continued distribution access with another party, we are also exposed to the risk of loss of exclusivity or change in access due to regulatory changes. 
                
    Integrating acquired operations with our existing operations may require us to coordinate geographically separated organizations, address possible differences in corporate culture and management philosophies, merge financial processes and risk and compliance procedures, combine separate information technology platforms and integrate operations that were previously closely tied to the former parent of the acquired business or other service providers. 
                
    In cases where we or an acquired business operates in certain markets through joint ventures, the acquisition may affect the continued success and prospects of the joint venture. 
                
    We may incur significant costs in connection with any acquisition and the related integration. The costs and liabilities actually incurred in connection with an acquisition and subsequent integration process may exceed those anticipated 
     There could be unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments, including goodwill impairments, which arise in connection with the businesses that we may sell or the businesses that we may acquire in the future. 
  In addition, there may be liabilities or asset impairments that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing acquisition-related due diligence investigations. Furthermore, even for obligations and liabilities that we do discover during the due diligence process, neither the valuation adjustment nor the contractual protections we negotiate may be sufficient to fully protect us from losses. Although we generally have rights to indemnification for certain losses, our rights are limited by survival periods for bringing claims and limitations on the nature and amount of losses we may recover, and we cannot be certain that indemnification will be, among other things, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset any loss we may suffer. For example, we are indemnified under the stock purchase agreement dated as of March 7, 2010, as amended, by and among MetLife, Inc., American International Group, Inc. ( AIG ) and ALICO Holdings, LLC (now AM Holdings, LLC), a subsidiary of AIG, for various tax matters, including U.S. federal income taxes attributable to periods during which the ALICO business was included in AIG s consolidated federal income tax return. It is possible, however, that any such indemnification may not be fully collectible. The use of our own funds as consideration in any acquisition would consume capital resources, which could affect our capital plan and render those funds unavailable for other corporate purposes. We also may not be able to raise sufficient funds to consummate an acquisition if, for example, we are unable to sell our securities or close related bridge credit facilities. 
    49 

     Table of Contents  

   Risks Relating to Dispositions 
  We may separate a business through an outright sale, or by alternate means such as a public offering of shares in an independent, publicly traded company or a spin-off, which would also result in a separate, possibly independent and publicly traded, company. See Note 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Company s announcement of its plan to pursue the proposed Separation. Any Separation that might occur will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval of any transaction by the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the SEC, and receipt of insurance and other regulatory approvals and other anticipated conditions. No assurance can be given regarding the form that the proposed Separation may take or the specific terms thereof, or that the Separation will in fact occur.  
  Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect our ability to effect any disposition transaction. Factors which could affect our ability to consummate such transactions include difficulties in finding buyers and delays or other problems with obtaining required regulatory, tax and other approvals, as well as adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets. 
  When we dispose of subsidiaries or operations, we may remain liable to the acquiror or to third parties for certain losses or costs arising from the divested business or on other bases. We may also incur a loss on the disposition. In anticipation of any disposition, we may need to restructure our operations, which could disrupt such operations and affect our ability to recruit key personnel needed to operate and grow such business. In addition, the actions of key employees of the business to be divested could adversely affect the success of such disposition as they may be more focused on obtaining employment, or the terms of their employment, than on maximizing the value of the business to be divested. Such restructuring could also adversely affect our internal controls and procedures and impair our relationships with key customers, distributors and suppliers. Any such separation will also decrease the diversification of our sources of revenue and result in a greater percentage of our revenue being derived from non-U.S. sources which may increase our exposure to certain risks. See    Risks Related to Our Business   Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability.  
  After any such disposition, shares of our Common Stock will represent an investment in a company different in size and characteristics from the present. These changes may cause some existing shareholders to sell their shares of our Common Stock, which could, if excessive, cause the market price of our Common Stock to decrease. In addition, we may be unable to timely dissolve all contractual relationships with the divested business in the course of the proposed transaction, which may materially adversely affect our ability to realize value from the disposition. 
  Risks Relating to Joint Ventures 
  We participate in joint ventures in several countries, including China and India. We may enter into joint ventures with other companies or government enterprises in various other international markets, including joint ventures where we may have a lesser degree of control over the business operations, which may expose us to additional operational, financial, legal or compliance risks. We may be dependent on a joint venture counterparty for capital, product distribution, local market knowledge, or other resources. Limits on our ownership levels under local laws or regulations may increase our dependence on joint venture counterparties and subsequent changes to such laws or regulations may impact how we account for our joint venture ownership interests. See    Risks Related to Our Business   Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability.   
  A joint venture may require an investment of considerable management, financial and operational resources to establish sufficient infrastructure such as underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance or other processes. If we are unable to effectively cooperate with joint venture counterparties, or any joint venture counterparty fails to meets its obligations under the joint venture arrangement, encounters financial difficulty, or elects to alter, modify or terminate the relationship, we may be unable to exercise management control or influence over these joint venture operations and our ability to achieve our objectives and our results of operations may be negatively impacted.

   Risks Relating to Legal Entity Reorganizations 
  In addition, we may reorganize or consolidate the legal entities through which we conduct business. For example, in November 2014, the Company completed the Mergers. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Executive Summary   Other Key Information   Significant Events.  The implementation of legal entity reorganizations is a complex undertaking and involves a number of risks similar to those outlined above that are present in the case of an acquisition, including additional costs and expenses, information technology-related delays and problems, loss of key personnel and distraction of management. Many aspects of these transactions are subject to regulatory approvals from a number of different jurisdictions. We may not obtain needed regulatory approvals in the timeframe anticipated or at all, which could reduce or prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of these transactions. These transactions or the related regulatory approvals may entail modifications of certain aspects of our operations, the composition of certain of our investment portfolios, and/or the cost of our derivatives hedging activities, which could result in additional costs or reduce net investment income. Any of these risks, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
    Investments-Related Risks 
  Should the Need Arise, We May Have Difficulty Selling Certain Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner and Realizing Full Value Given Their Illiquid Nature 
  There may be a limited market for certain investments we hold in our investment portfolio, making them relatively illiquid. These include privately-placed fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, policy loans, leveraged leases, other limited partnership interests, and real estate equity, such as real estate joint ventures and funds. In recent years, even some of our very high quality investments experienced reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption. If we were forced to sell certain of our investments during periods of market volatility or disruption, market prices may be lower than our carrying value in such investments. This could result in realized losses which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and financial position. 
  Similarly, we loan blocks of our securities to third parties (primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks) through our securities lending program, including fixed maturity and equity securities, short-term investments and cash equivalents. Under this program, we obtain collateral, usually cash, at the inception of a loan and typically purchase securities with the cash collateral. Upon the return to us of these loaned securities, we must return to the third party the cash collateral we received. If the cash collateral has been invested in securities, we need to sell the securities. However, in some cases, the maturity of those securities may exceed the term of the related securities on loan and the estimated fair value of the securities we need to sell may fall below the amount of cash received. 
  If we are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral under our securities lending program or otherwise need significant amounts of cash on short notice and we are forced to sell securities, we may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize under normal market conditions, or both. In the event of a forced sale, accounting guidance requires the recognition of a loss for securities in an unrealized loss position and may require the impairment of other securities based on our ability to hold those securities, which would negatively impact our financial condition. In addition, under stressful capital market and economic conditions, liquidity broadly deteriorates, which may further restrict our ability to sell securities. Furthermore, if we decrease the amount of our securities lending activities over time, the amount of net investment income generated by these activities will also likely decline.

   Our Requirements to Pledge Collateral or Make Payments Related to Declines in Estimated Fair Value of Derivatives Transactions or Specified Assets in Connection with OTC-Cleared and OTC-Bilateral Transactions May Adversely Affect Our Liquidity, Expose Us to Central Clearinghouse and Counterparty Credit Risk, and Increase our Costs of Hedging 
  Substantially all of our derivatives transactions require us to pledge collateral related to any decline in the net estimated fair value of such derivatives transactions executed through a specific broker at a clearinghouse or entered into with a specific counterparty on a bilateral basis. Certain derivatives financing transactions require us to pledge collateral or make payments related to declines in the estimated fair value of the specified assets under certain circumstances to central clearinghouses or our counterparties. The amount of collateral we may be required to pledge and the payments we may be required to make under our derivatives transactions may increase under certain circumstances and will increase as a result of the requirement to pledge initial margin for OTC-cleared transactions entered into after June 10, 2013 and for OTC-bilateral transactions entered into after the phase-in period, which would be applicable to us in 2020 as a result of the adoption by the Prudential Regulators and the CFTC of final margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. Although the final rules allow us to pledge a broad range of non-cash collateral as initial and variation margin, the Prudential Regulators, CFTC, central clearinghouses and counterparties may restrict or eliminate certain types of previously eligible collateral or charge us to pledge such non-cash collateral, which would increase our costs and could adversely affect the liquidity of our investments and the composition of our investment portfolio. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Regulation of Over-the-Counter Derivatives,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Liquidity and Capital Uses   Pledged Collateral,  and Note   9   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Gross Unrealized Losses on Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities and Defaults, Downgrades or Other Events May Result in Future Impairments to the Carrying Value of Such Securities, Resulting in a Reduction in Our Net Income 
  Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale ( AFS ) securities are reported at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on AFS securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) and are, therefore, excluded from net income. In recent periods, as a result of low interest rates, the unrealized gains on our fixed maturity securities have far exceeded the unrealized losses. However, if interest rates rise, our unrealized gains would decrease and our unrealized losses would increase, perhaps substantially. The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these AFS securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon the sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Investments   Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities AFS.  
  The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, or other events that adversely affect the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of structured securities could cause the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and corresponding earnings to decline and cause the default rate of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio to increase. A ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular securities, or similar trends that could worsen the credit quality of issuers, such as the corporate issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, could also have a similar effect. With economic uncertainty, credit quality of issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected. Similarly, a ratings downgrade affecting a security we hold could indicate the credit quality of that security has deteriorated and could increase the capital we must hold to support that security to maintain our RBC levels. Levels of writedowns or impairments are impacted by intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fixed maturity securities, as well as our intent and ability to hold equity securities which have declined in value until recovery. Realized losses or impairments on these securities may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.

   Our Valuation of Securities and Investments and the Determination of the Amount of Allowances and Impairments Taken on Our Investments Are Subjective and Include Methodologies, Estimations and Assumptions Which Are Subject to Differing Interpretations and Market Conditions and, if Changed, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations or Financial Condition 
  Fixed maturity, equity, fair value option ( FVO ) and trading securities, as well as short-term investments that are reported at estimated fair value represent the majority of our total cash and investments. We define fair value generally as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Considerable judgment is often required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect of the estimated fair value amounts. During periods of market disruption including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. In addition, in times of financial market disruption, certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data may become illiquid. In those cases, the valuation process includes inputs that are less observable and require more subjectivity and management judgment. Valuations may result in estimated fair values which vary significantly from the amount at which the investments may ultimately be sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in estimated fair value could vary significantly. Decreases in the estimated fair value of securities we hold may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Investments  and Notes   1   and   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. We reflect any changes in allowances and impairments in earnings as such evaluations are revised. However, historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances. In addition, any such future impairments or allowances could have a materially adverse effect on our earnings and financial position. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates   Investment Impairments  an  d Note   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Defaults on Our Mortgage Loans and Volatility in Performance May Adversely Affect Our Profitability 
  Our mortgage loans face default risk and are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties. We establish valuation allowances for estimated impairments, which are based on loan risk characteristics, historical default rates and loss severities, real estate market fundamentals and outlooks, as well as other relevant factors. In addition, substantially all of our mortgage loans held-for-investment have balloon payment maturities. An increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments or fluctuations in their performance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Further, any geographic or property type concentration of our mortgage loans may have adverse effects on our investment portfolio and consequently on our results of operations or financial condition. While we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated. Moreover, our ability to sell assets relating to such particular groups of related assets may be limited if other market participants are seeking to sell at the same time. In addition, legislative proposals that would allow or require modifications to the terms of mortgage loans could be enacted. We cannot predict whether these proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business or investments. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Investments   Mortgage Loans.

   The Defaults or Deteriorating Credit of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Us 
  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, central clearinghouses, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds and investment funds and other financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. We also have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, non-redeemable and redeemable preferred securities, derivatives, joint venture, hedge fund and equity investments. Further, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies in response to the financial crisis affecting the global banking system and financial markets, such as investment, nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, whether under existing legal authority or any new authority that may be created, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks  credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. Any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these investments or other changes may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.  
    Risks Related to Our Business 
  Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability 
  Our international operations face political, legal, financial, operational and other risks. These operations may be materially adversely affected by the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and regulators, such as through nationalization or expropriation of assets; the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies which may increase our dependence on joint venture counterparties and/or impact how we account for our joint venture ownership interests; changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations), their application or interpretation; political instability (including any resulting economic or trade sanctions); dividend limitations; price controls; changes in applicable currency; currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies, as well as other adverse actions by foreign governmental authorities and regulators, such as the retroactive application of new requirements on our current and prior activities or operations and the imposition of regulations limiting our ability to distribute our products. Such actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions and could indirectly affect our business in other jurisdictions as well. Some of our foreign insurance operations are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where these risks are heightened.  
  Part of our international insurance operations may be subject to assessments, generally based on their proportionate share of business written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations to policyholders and claimants resulting from the insolvency of insurance companies. We cannot predict the timing and scope of any assessments that may be made in the future, which may materially affect the results of operations of our international insurance operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. See  Business   Regulation   International Regulation  and  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  as well as    Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.  
  We have operations in regions where the legal and political systems and regulatory frameworks are subject to instability and disruptions. For example, instability has increased in many parts of the Middle East, as well as China, Argentina, Ukraine and Russia. Lack of legal certainty and stability in these regions exposes our operations there to increased risk of disruption and to adverse or unpredictable actions by regulators and may make it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts, which may negatively impact our business in these regions.

   We have market presence in numerous countries and increased exposure to risks posed by local and regional economic conditions. China, Europe and Japan continue to experience overall sluggish economic performance, with concerns over low inflation. We face substantial exposure to the Japanese economy given our operations there. Unfavorable economic conditions in Japan, as well as in China and Europe, could adversely impact the demand for our products, negatively impact earnings, adversely affect the performance of our investments or result in impairments, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See    Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks   If Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally Persist, They May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.  Certain EU member states, including Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain ( Europe s perimeter region ) have been particularly affected by the sluggish economy, resulting in increased national debts and depressed economic activity. We have significant operations and investments in certain of these countries, including Europe s perimeter region, which could be adversely affected by economic developments such as higher taxes, growing inflation, deflation, decreasing government spending, rising unemployment and currency instability. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Investments   Current Environment,     Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability,  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Financial and Economic Environment.  
  Furthermore, we rely on local sales forces in these countries and may encounter labor problems resulting from workers  associations and trade unions in some countries. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in building and training the sales force in that country. 
  We are continuing to expand our international operations in certain markets where we operate and in selected new markets. This may require considerable management time, as well as start-up expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated. The prospects of our business also may be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to manage the growth of such international operations successfully. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing such future growth. Further, operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local political, economic and market conditions. Therefore, as we expand internationally, we may not achieve expected operating margins and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. 
  Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability 
  We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar resulting from our holdings of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, net income from foreign operations and issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated instruments, including guaranteed interest contracts and funding agreements. In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, our investments in foreign subsidiaries, and our net income from foreign operations. In addition, from time to time, various emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is exacerbated by our investments in these emerging markets. See  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  
  In addition, certain of our life and annuity products are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk. Payments under these contracts, depending on the circumstances, may be required to be made in different currencies and may not be the legal tender in the country whose law governs the particular product. Changes in exchange rate movements and the imposition of capital controls may also directly impact the liability valuation that may not be entirely hedged. If the currency upon which expected future payments are made strengthens, the liability valuation may increase, which may result in a reduction of net income. 
  Historically, we have matched substantially all of our foreign currency denominated liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with investments denominated in their respective foreign currency, which limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on local operating results; however, fluctuations in such rates affect the translation of these results into our U.S. dollar basis consolidated financial statements. Although we take certain actions to address this risk, including entering into foreign currency derivatives, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially adversely affect our reported results due to unhedged positions or the failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. Our reported results could also be adversely affected if the economy of one or more of our foreign subsidiaries is determined to be  highly inflationary,  generally defined by a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period.  
    55 

     Table of Contents  

   We face substantial exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in the yen/U.S. dollar exchange rate because we have substantial operations in Japan and a significant portion of our premiums and investment income in Japan are received in yen. Most claims and expenses associated with our operations in Japan are also paid in yen and we primarily purchase yen-denominated assets to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen-denominated financial statement items are, however, translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, fluctuations in the yen/U.S. dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported financial position and results of operations. Our Japan operation does assume some currency exposure by backing a portion of surplus and yen-denominated liabilities with U.S. dollar assets. Although this represents risk to our Japan operation, this activity reduces yen exposure at the enterprise level  . Additionally, our Japan operation sells U.S. dollar and Australian dollar life and annuity products to Japanese customers. We may experience elevated levels of early policy terminations when the Japanese yen weakens against these currencies. While the cost of early policy terminations is offset by surrender charges, foreign exchange rate fluctuations will impact both our sales volumes and the amount of business we have in-force. 
  Due to our significant international operations, during periods when any foreign currency in which we derive our revenues weakens (strengthens), translating amounts expressed in that currency into U.S. dollars causes fewer (more) U.S. dollars to be reported. Any unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments ( FCTA ) are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ). The weakening of a foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar will generally adversely affect the value of investments in U.S. dollar terms and reduce the level of reserves denominated in that currency. 
  An Inability to Access Our Credit Facilities Could Result in a Reduction in Our Liquidity and Lead to Downgrades in Our Credit and Financial Strength Ratings 
  We rely on our credit facilities as a potential source of liquidity. The availability of these facilities could be critical to our credit and financial strength ratings and our ability to meet our obligations as they come due in a market when alternative sources of credit are tight. These credit facilities contain certain administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants, including a requirement to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Liquidity and Capital Sources   Global Funding Sources   Credit and Committed Facilities  and Note   12   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Our right to borrow funds under these facilities is subject to the fulfillment of certain important conditions, including our compliance with all covenants, and our ability to borrow under these facilities is also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the lenders that are parties to the facilities to provide funds. Our failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facilities or fulfill the conditions to borrowings, or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments (whether due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons) in the amounts provided for under the terms of the facilities, would restrict our ability to access these credit facilities when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  We May Need to Fund Deficiencies in Our Closed Block; Assets Allocated to the Closed Block Benefit Only the Holders of Closed Block Policies 
  MLIC s plan of reorganization, as amended, established in connection with its demutualization (the  Plan of Reorganization ), required that we establish and operate an accounting mechanism, known as a closed block, to ensure that the reasonable dividend expectations of policyholders who own individual participating whole life insurance policies of MLIC in force at the time of the demutualization are met. We allocated assets to the closed block in an amount that will produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenue from the policies included in the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain expenses and tax, and to provide for the continuation of the policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the experience underlying such scales continues, and for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenue from the policies included in the closed block may not be sufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed under these policies. If they are not, we must fund the shortfall. Even if they are sufficient, we may choose, for competitive reasons, to support policyholder dividend payments with our general account funds. 
  The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies in the closed block. In addition, to the extent that these amounts are greater than the amounts estimated at the time the closed block was funded, dividends payable in respect of the policies included in the closed block may be greater than they would be in the absence of a closed block. Any excess earnings will be available for distribution over time only to closed block policyholders. See Note   7   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   A Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or Credit Ratings Could Result in a Loss of Business and Materially Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  Financial strength ratings are published by various Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ( NRSROs ) and similar entities not formally recognized as NRSROs. They indicate the NRSROs  opinion regarding an insurance company s ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, and are important to maintaining public confidence in our products and our competitive position. See  Business   Company Ratings  for additional information regarding our financial strength ratings. 
  Downgrades in our financial strength ratings or changes to our rating outlooks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including: 
             
    reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other investment products; 
                
    adversely affecting our relationships with our sales force and independent sales intermediaries; 
                
    materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders; 
                
    requiring us to post additional collateral under certain of our financing and derivative transactions; 
                
    requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive; and 
                
    adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices or at all. 
     In addition to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, various NRSROs also publish credit ratings for MetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries. Credit ratings indicate the NRSROs  opinion regarding a debt issuer s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner and are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. Downgrades in our credit ratings or changes to our rating outlooks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including limiting our access to capital markets, potentially increasing the cost of debt, and requiring us to post collateral. See Note   9   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the impact of a one-notch downgrade with respect to derivative transactions with credit rating downgrade triggers and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Liquidity and Capital Uses   Pledged Collateral  for further information on the impact of a one-notch downgrade. See also  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Capital   Rating Agencies.   
  In view of the difficulties experienced by many financial institutions as a result of the financial crisis and ensuing global recession, including our competitors in the insurance industry, we believe it is possible that the NRSROs will continue to heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies, will continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, will continue to request additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without notice by any NRSRO. 
  Reinsurance May Not Be Available, Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us Against Losses 
  As part of our overall risk management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments. While reinsurance agreements generally bind the reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally fixed pricing, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new business. In certain circumstances, the price of reinsurance for business already reinsured may also increase. For example, for some of our group businesses under which the policies and related reinsurance are subject to periodic (typically annual) renewal, prices may increase at any renewal. Also, for most of our traditional life reinsurance agreements, it is common for the reinsurer to have a right to increase reinsurance rates on in-force business if there is a systematic deterioration of mortality in the market as a whole. Any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance, reduce our earnings. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to those policies we issue. See  Business   Reinsurance Activity  and    If the Counterparties to Our Reinsurance or Indemnification Arrangements or to the Derivatives We Use to Hedge Our Business Risks Default or Fail to Perform, We May Be Exposed to Risks We Had Sought to Mitigate, Which Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

   If the Counterparties to Our Reinsurance or Indemnification Arrangements or to the Derivatives We Use to Hedge Our Business Risks Default or Fail to Perform, We May Be Exposed to Risks We Had Sought to Mitigate, Which Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  We use reinsurance, indemnification and derivatives to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. In general, reinsurance, indemnification and derivatives do not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers, indemnitors, counterparties and central clearinghouses. A reinsurer s, indemnitor s, counterparty s or central clearinghouse s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of reinsurance agreements, indemnity agreements or derivatives agreements with us or inability or unwillingness to return collateral could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including our liquidity. See  Business   Reinsurance Activity.  
  In addition, we use derivatives to hedge various business risks. We enter into a variety of derivatives, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit default and currency swaps with a number of counterparties on a bilateral basis for uncleared OTC derivatives and with clearing brokers and central clearinghouses for OTC-cleared derivatives. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Derivatives.  If our counterparties, clearing brokers or central clearinghouses fail or refuse to honor their obligations under these derivatives, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. This risk is more pronounced in light of the stresses suffered by financial institutions over the past few years. Such failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  
  Differences Between Actual Claims Experience and Underwriting and Reserving Assumptions May Adversely Affect Our Financial Results 
  Our earnings significantly depend upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in setting prices for our products and establishing liabilities for future policy benefits and claims. Such amounts are established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. To the extent that actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions we used in establishing such liabilities, we could be required to increase our liabilities. 
  Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of liabilities for future policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely the amounts which we will ultimately pay to settle our liabilities. Such amounts may vary from the estimated amounts, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. We evaluate our liabilities periodically based on accounting requirements, which change from time to time, the assumptions used to establish the liabilities, as well as our actual experience. If the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we must increase them. Such increases could affect earnings negatively and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See  Business   Policyholder Liabilities  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Policyholder Liabilities.  
  Catastrophes May Adversely Impact Liabilities for Policyholder Claims and Reinsurance Availability 
  Our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and man-made catastrophes may produce significant damage or loss of life or property damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. In addition, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of issuers of obligations we hold in our investment portfolio, resulting in impairments to these obligations, and the financial condition of our reinsurers, thereby increasing the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Large-scale catastrophes may also reduce the overall level of economic activity in affected countries which could hurt our business and the value of our investments or our ability to write new business. It is possible that increases in the value, caused by the effects of inflation or other factors, and geographic concentration of insured lives or property, could increase the severity of claims we receive from future catastrophic events.

   Our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths. Significant influenza pandemics have occurred three times in the last century; however, the likelihood, timing, and severity of a future pandemic cannot be predicted. A significant pandemic could have a major impact on the global economy or the economies of particular countries or regions, including travel, trade, tourism, the health system, food supply, consumption, overall economic output and, eventually, on the financial markets. In addition, a pandemic that affected our employees or the employees of our distributors or of other companies with which we do business could disrupt our business operations. The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material impact on the losses experienced by us. In our group insurance operations, a localized event that affects the workplace of one or more of our group insurance customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims. These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition. 
  Our property   casualty businesses have experienced, and will likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses that may have a material adverse impact on their business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we make every effort to limit our exposure to catastrophic risks through volatility management and reinsurance programs, these efforts do not eliminate all risk. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and man-made events such as terrorist attacks. Historically, most of our property   casualty catastrophe-related claims have related to homeowners coverages. However, catastrophes may also affect other property   casualty coverages. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing and severity of catastrophes. In addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes, tornadoes and floods.  
  We have hurricane exposure in coastal sections of the northeastern U.S. (including lower New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts), the south Atlantic states (including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) and the Gulf Coast (including Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas). We also have some earthquake exposure, primarily along the New Madrid fault line in the central U.S. and in the Pacific Northwest. 
  Consistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities. From time to time, states have passed legislation that has the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage risk, such as legislation restricting an insurer s ability to withdraw from catastrophe-prone areas. While we attempt to limit our exposure to acceptable levels, subject to restrictions imposed by insurance regulatory authorities, a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  Most of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business require life and property   casualty insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations. These associations are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers, who may become impaired, insolvent or fail, for example, following the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. In addition, certain states have government owned or controlled organizations providing life and property   casualty insurance to their citizens. The activities of such organizations could also place additional stress on the adequacy of guaranty fund assessments. Many of these organizations also have the power to levy assessments similar to those of the guaranty associations described above. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Insurance Regulation   Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements  and  Business   Regulation   International Regulation.  
  While in the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against MetLife have not been material, it is possible that a large catastrophic event could render such guaranty funds inadequate and we may be called upon to contribute additional amounts, which may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in a particular period. We have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate, but additional liabilities may be necessary. See Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Our ability to manage this risk and the profitability of our property   casualty and life insurance businesses depends in part on our ability to obtain catastrophe reinsurance, which may not be available at commercially acceptable rates in the future. See    Reinsurance May Not Be Available, Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us Against Losses.

   Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings May Be Subject to Cost Increases and New Financings May Be Subject to Limited Market Capacity 
  We currently utilize capital markets solutions to finance a portion of our statutory reserve requirements for several products, including, but not limited to, our level premium term li  fe subject to the NAIC Model Regulation Valuation of Life Insurance Policies (commonly referred to as XXX), and ULSG subject to NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (commonly referred to as AXXX),   as well as MLIC s closed block. While we have financing facilities in place for certain previously written business, certain of these facilities are subject to cost increases upon the occurrence of specified ratings downgrades of MetLife or are subject to periodic re-pricing. Any resulting cost increases could negatively impact our financial results. 
  Future capacity for these statutory reserve funding structures in the marketplace is not guaranteed. Currently, state insurance regulators and the NAIC are investigating the use of captive reinsurers and offshore entities to reinsure insurance risks. See    Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.  Insurance regulators in a few states, including New York and California, have imposed a moratorium on new reinsurance transactions between life insurers domiciled in those states and captive reinsurers. If additional state insurance regulators determine to restrict the use of captive reinsurers for purposes of funding reserve requirements or capacity in the capital markets otherwise becomes unavailable for a prolonged period of time, thereby hindering our ability to obtain funding for these new structures, our ability to write additional business in a cost effective manner may be impacted. 
  Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability 
  We believe competition amongst insurance companies is based on a number of factors, including service, product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition. We compete globally with a large number of other insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for individual consumers, employers and other group customers and agents and other distributors of insurance and investment products. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete. In some circumstances, national banks that sell annuity products of life insurers may also have pre-existing customer bases for financial services products. Additionally, many of our group insurance products are underwritten annually. There is a risk that group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors than they could renewing coverage with us. These competitive pressures may adversely affect the persistency of these and other products, as well as our ability to sell our products in the future. Furthermore, the investment management and securities brokerage businesses have relatively few barriers to entry and continually attract new entrants. See  Business   Competition.  
  The insurance industry distributes many of its individual products through other financial institutions such as banks and broker-dealers. An increase in bank and broker-dealer consolidation activity may negatively impact the industry s sales, and such consolidation could increase competition for access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses and impair our ability to market insurance products to our current customer base or to expand our customer base. Consolidation of distributors and/or other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to terms less favorable to us. 
  In addition, since numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation, legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment for our business may have, over time, the effect of supporting or burdening some aspects of the financial services industry more than others. This can affect our competitive position within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See  Business   Regulation,     Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth,  and    Regulatory and Legal Risks   Changes in U.S. Federal, State Securities and State Insurance Laws and Regulations May Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability.  
  If Our Business Does Not Perform Well, We May Be Required to Recognize an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to Establish a Valuation Allowance Against the Deferred Income Tax Asset, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations or Financial Condition 
  We perform our goodwill impairment testing using the fair value approach, which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the  reporting unit  level. A reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment under certain circumstances. 
    60 

     Table of Contents  

   The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business, which may be adversely impacted by prolonged market declines. If it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, we must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Such writedowns could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates   Goodwill  and Notes   1   and   11   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Long-lived assets, including assets such as real estate, also require impairment testing. This testing is done to determine whether changes in circumstances indicate that we will be unable to recover the carrying amount of the asset group. Such writedowns could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
  Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in management s determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate future taxable income. If, based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. In addition, changes in the corporate tax rates could affect the value of our deferred tax assets and may require a write-off of some of those assets. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates   Income Taxes.  
  If Our Business Does Not Perform Well or if Actual Experience Versus Estimates Used in Valuing and Amortizing DAC, Deferred Sales Inducements ( DSI ) and VOBA Vary Significantly, We May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization and/or Impair the DAC, DSI and VOBA Which Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations or Financial Condition 
  We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance business are deferred and referred to as DAC. Bonus amounts credited to certain policyholders, either immediately upon receiving a deposit or as excess interest credits for a period of time, are deferred and referred to as DSI. VOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in-force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on actuarially determined projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. DAC, DSI and VOBA related to fixed and variable universal life and deferred annuity contracts are amortized in proportion to actual and expected future gross profits and for most participating contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross margins. The amount of future gross profit or margin is dependent principally on investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest crediting rates, dividends paid to policyholders, expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables, such as inflation. Of these factors, we anticipate that investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of DAC for the aforementioned contracts. 
  If actual gross profits or margins are less than originally expected, then the amortization of such costs would be accelerated in the period the actual experience is known and would result in a charge to income. Significant or sustained equity market declines could result in an acceleration of amortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, resulting in a charge to income. Such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Industry Trends   Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment  for a discussion of how significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. 
  See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates   Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired  and Note   1   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further consideration of DAC and VOBA. 
  Guarantees Within Certain of Our Products May Decrease Our Earnings, Increase the Volatility of Our Results, Result in Higher Risk Management Costs and Expose Us to Increased Counterparty Risk 
  Certain of our variable annuity products include guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed minimum death benefits ( GMDBs ), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ( GMWBs ), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ( GMABs ), and guaranteed minimum income benefits ( GMIBs ). These guarantees are designed to protect policyholders against significant downturns in equity markets and interest rates. Any such periods of significant and sustained downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility, or reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of our liabilities associated with those products. An increase in these liabilities would result in a decrease in our net income. 
    61 

     Table of Contents  

   We use hedging and other risk management strategies to mitigate the liability exposure and the volatility of net income associated with these liabilities. These strategies involve the use of reinsurance and derivatives, which may not be completely effective. For example, in the event that reinsurers, derivative counterparties or central clearinghouses are unable or unwilling to pay, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits. See    If the Counterparties to Our Reinsurance or Indemnification Arrangements or to the Derivatives We Use to Hedge Our Business Risks Default or Fail to Perform, We May Be Exposed to Risks We Had Sought to Mitigate, Which Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   
  In addition, hedging instruments may not effectively offset the costs of guarantees or may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our obligations. Furthermore, we are subject to the risk that changes in policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, produce economic losses not addressed by the risk management techniques employed. These, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including net income, financial condition or liquidity. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of     Financial Condition and   Results of Operations   Policyholder Liabilities   Variable Annuity Guarantees  and Note     1     of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further consideration of the risks associated with guaranteed benefits. 
    Capital-Related Risks 
  Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish 
  The declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. There is no requirement or assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends. In addition, as a result of MetLife, Inc. s designation as a non-bank SIFI, we may be subject to restrictions arising from Federal Reserve regulation, including capital planning and stress testing requirements. The capital requirements that will apply to non-bank SIFIs are unclear. Furthermore, if additional capital requirements are imposed on MetLife, Inc. as a G-SII, its ability to pay dividends could be reduced by any such additional capital requirements that might be imposed. See    Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.  In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase our common stock is subject to restrictions arising from the terms of our preferred stock, junior subordinated debentures and trust securities, so called  dividend stopper  provisions, in situations where we may be experiencing financial stress. For purposes of this discussion,  junior subordinated debentures  are deemed to include MetLife s Fixed-to-Floating Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities, which are exchangeable for junior subordinated debentures, and which contain terms with the same substantive effects in this discussion as the terms of MetLife, Inc. s junior subordinated debentures. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock and interest on our junior subordinated debentures is also restricted by the terms of those securities.  
  Regulatory Restrictions 
  The Federal Reserve Board is required under Dodd-Frank to adopt enhanced prudential standards, including heightened capital and stress testing requirements, for non-bank SIFIs.     While stress testing requirements have been adopted, they will not be effective until rules relating to capital requirements are implemented. Although the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it intends to apply enhanced prudential standards to non-bank SIFIs by rule or order, it has not yet done so. Therefore, the     manner in which these proposed standards might apply to MetLife, Inc., as a non-bank SIFI, remains unclear. See  Business           Regulation           U.S. Regulation           Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI.  See also  Business           Regulation           International Regulation           Global Systemically Important Insurers  regarding potential restrictions on MetLife, Inc. as a G-SII. It is possible that these requirements, or any others adopted, could restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock     or other securities or engage in other transactions that could affect our capital  . Furthermore, as a non-bank SIFI, MetLife, Inc. will be subject to stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve, and our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock will be dependent on demonstrating the robustness of our capital planning and projection processes, as well as our ability to maintain our capital levels above regulatory minimum levels under stress scenarios. In addition, MetLife, Inc. may not be able to pay dividends if it does not receive sufficient funds from its operating subsidiaries, which are themselves subject to separate regulatory restrictions on their ability to pay dividends.

    Dividend Stopper  Provisions in Our Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures 
  Certain terms of our preferred stock and our junior subordinated debentures may prevent us from purchasing our common stock or paying dividends on our common stock in certain circumstances. Moreover, MetLife, Inc. is a party to certain replacement capital covenants which limit its ability to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of preferred stock or junior subordinated debentures by requiring MetLife, subject to certain limitations, to receive cash proceeds during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement securities prior to any repayment, redemption or purchase. See Note   14   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of such covenants in effect with respect to junior subordinated debentures. 
  Under our preferred stock, if we have not paid the full dividends on our preferred stock for a dividend period, we may not repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock for that period. Under our junior subordinated debentures, if we have not paid in full the accrued interest through the most recent interest payment date on our junior subordinated debentures, we may not repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock or other capital stock (including the preferred stock), subject to certain exceptions. 
  Trigger Events for the Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends on Our Preferred Stock and Restrictions on the Payment of Interest on Our Junior Subordinated Debentures 
  In addition, the preferred stock and the junior subordinated debentures contain provisions that would automatically suspend the payment of preferred stock dividends and junior subordinated debenture interest payments if MetLife, Inc. fails to meet certain tests ( Trigger Events ) at specified times, although in such cases MetLife would be permitted to make the payments if it were able to utilize the  Alternative Payment Mechanism  described below. As a result of the suspension of these payments, the  dividend stopper  provisions would come into effect. A  Trigger Event  would occur if the RBC ratio of MetLife s largest U.S. insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate (as defined in the applicable instrument) were to be less than 175% of the company action level based on the subsidiaries  prior year annual financial statements filed (generally around March 1) with state insurance commissioners. A  Trigger Event  would also occur if, at the end of a quarter, consolidated GAAP net income for the four-quarter period ending two quarters before such quarter-end is zero or less and adjusted shareholders  equity (as defined in the applicable instrument), as of such quarter-end and the end of the quarter two quarters before such quarter-end, declined by 10% or more from its level 10 quarters before such quarter-end. The Trigger Event would continue until there is no longer a Trigger Event at the specified time, and adjusted shareholders  equity is no longer 10% or more below its level at the beginning of each measurement period described above that is associated with a  Trigger Event.  
  In order to use the  Alternative Payment Mechanism  referred to above to declare and pay preferred stock dividends or interest on junior subordinated debentures, MetLife must sell common stock during the 90 days preceding the dividend declaration date or sell common stock or certain kinds of warrants to purchase common stock during the 180 days prior to the interest payment date, make dividend or interest payments not in excess of the net proceeds of these sales, and satisfy other specified conditions. 
  Dividends on Our Preferred Stock Are Subject to Declaration by Our Board of Directors 
  In addition to the provisions described above that prevent us from declaring and paying dividends on our preferred stock, dividends on our preferred stock are subject to declaration each quarter by our Board of Directors. If our Board of Directors does not declare dividends on the preferred stock for any quarterly dividend period, the  dividend stopper  provisions in our preferred stock would prevent us from repurchasing or paying dividends on our common stock for that period. 
  Optional Deferral of Interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures 
  The junior subordinated debentures provide that MetLife may, at its option and provided that certain conditions are met, defer payment of interest without giving rise to an event of default for periods of up to 10 years (although after five years MetLife, Inc. would be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell equity securities to raise proceeds to pay the interest), with no limitation on the number of deferral periods that MetLife, Inc. may begin so long as all accrued and unpaid interest is paid with respect to prior deferral periods. If MetLife, Inc. were to elect to defer payments of interest, the  dividend stopper  provisions in the junior subordinated debentures would thus prevent MetLife, Inc. from repurchasing or paying dividends on its common stock or other capital stock (including the preferred stock) during the period of deferral, subject to exceptions. 
  See Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these restrictions.

   As a Holding Company, MetLife, Inc. Depends on the Ability of Its Subsidiaries to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow 
  MetLife, Inc. is a holding company for its insurance and financial subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. Dividends from its subsidiaries and permitted payments to it under its tax sharing agreement with its subsidiaries are its principal sources of cash to meet its obligations and to pay preferred and common stock dividends. If the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets. 
  The payment of dividends and other distributions to MetLife, Inc. by its U.S. insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits require insurance regulatory approval. In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of dividends or other payments by its insurance subsidiaries to MetLife, Inc. if they determine that the payment could be adverse to our policyholders or contractholders. The payment of dividends and other distributions by insurance companies is also influenced by business conditions and rating agency considerations. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Insurance Regulation  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   MetLife, Inc.   Liquidity and Capital Sources   Dividends from Subsidiaries.

  Any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our foreign subsidiaries and branches to MetLife, Inc. could be subject to taxation, insurance regulatory or other restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdiction in which such foreign subsidiaries operate. See  Business   Regulation   International Regulation  and    Risks Related to Our Business   Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability.  
  Dividends from operating subsidiaries are a major component of holding company free cash flow. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures.  If MetLife, Inc. s operating subsidiaries were unable to make expected dividend payments to MetLife, Inc., we may be unable to meet our free cash flow goals and our ability to distribute cash to shareholders could be adversely affected. 
    Operational Risks 
  Our Risk Management Policies and Procedures May Leave Us Exposed to Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk, Which Could Negatively Affect Our Business 
  Our enterprise risk management is designed to mitigate material risks and loss to the Company. We develop and periodically update our risk management policies and procedures to reflect ongoing review of our risks and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not be comprehensive and may not identify every risk to which we are exposed. Many of our methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market behavior to model or project potential future exposure. Models used by our business are based on assumptions and projections. These models may not operate properly or input and assumptions may be inaccurate. As a result, these methods may not fully predict future exposures, which can be significantly greater than our historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This information may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. In addition, more extensive and perhaps different risk management policies and procedures might have to be implemented under pending regulations. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI,   Business   Regulation   International Regulation   Global Systemically Important Insurers  and  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  
  The Continued Threat of Terrorism and Ongoing Military Actions May Adversely Affect the Value of Our Investment Portfolio and the Level of Claim Losses We Incur 
  The continued threat of terrorism, both within the U.S. and abroad, ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. The value of assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism. Companies in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of financial, commercial or economic disruptions and such disruptions might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or principal on their securities or mortgage loans. Terrorist actions also could disrupt our operations centers in the U.S. or abroad and result in higher than anticipated claims under our insurance policies.

   The Failure in Cyber- or Other Information Security Systems, as well as the Occurrence of Events Unanticipated in Our Disaster Recovery Systems and Management Continuity Planning, Could Result in a Loss or Disclosure of Confidential Information, Damage to Our Reputation and Impairment of Our Ability to Conduct Business Effectively  
  Our business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our computer systems. We rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions, including processing claims and applications, providing information to customers and distributors, performing actuarial analyses and maintaining financial records. We also retain confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems and we rely on sophisticated technologies to maintain the security of that information. Our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyberattacks or other computer-related penetrations. While, to date, MetLife has not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity, administrative and technical controls and other preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems. 
  In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist attack, cyberattack or war, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial position, particularly if those problems affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable data. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our managers were unavailable following a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. These interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers  ability to provide goods and services and our employees  ability to perform their job responsibilities. 
  The failure of our computer systems and/or our disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in our operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers. Such a failure could harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and legal claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. Although we conduct due diligence, negotiate contractual provisions and, in many cases, conduct periodic reviews of our vendors, distributors, and other third-parties that provide operational or information technology services to us to confirm compliance with MetLife s information security standards, the failure of such third-parties  computer systems and/or their disaster recovery plans for any reason might cause significant interruptions in our operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers. Such a failure could harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and legal claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first party liability coverages, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses. MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries maintain a primary cybersecurity and privacy liability insurance policy with a limit of $15 million, and have additional coverage for cybersecurity and privacy liability available under blended professional liability excess coverage policies with a total limit of $210 million.  
  Our Associates May Take Excessive Risks Which Could Negatively Affect Our Financial Condition and Business 
  As an insurance enterprise, we are in the business of accepting certain risks. The associates who conduct our business, including executive officers and other members of management, sales managers, investment professionals, product managers, sales agents, and other associates, do so in part by making decisions and choices that involve exposing us to risk. These include decisions such as setting underwriting guidelines and standards, product design and pricing, determining what assets to purchase for investment and when to sell them, which business opportunities to pursue, and other decisions. We endeavor, in the design and implementation of our compensation programs and practices, to avoid giving our associates incentives to take excessive risks; however, associates may take such risks regardless of the structure of our compensation programs and practices. Similarly, although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor associates  business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks, and to prevent employee misconduct, these controls and procedures may not be effective. If our associates take excessive risks, the impact of those risks could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business operations.

   General Risks 
  MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors May Influence the Outcome of Stockholder Votes on Many Matters Due to the Voting Provisions of the MetLife Policyholder Trust 
  Under the Plan, we established the MetLife Policyholder Trust to hold the shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock allocated to eligible policyholders not receiving cash or policy credits under the plan. As of February 22, 2016, the Trust held 170,131,613 shares, or 15.5%, of the outstanding shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock. Because of voting provisions of the Trust and the number of shares held by it, the Trust may affect the outcome of matters brought to a stockholder vote. Except on votes regarding certain fundamental corporate actions described below, the trustee will vote all of the shares of common stock held in the Trust in accordance with the recommendations given by MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors to its stockholders or, if the Board gives no such recommendations, as directed by the Board. As a result of the voting provisions of the Trust, the Board of Directors may be able to influence the outcome of votes on matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, excluding certain fundamental corporate actions, so long as the Trust holds a substantial number of shares of common stock. 
  If the vote relates to fundamental corporate actions specified in the Trust, the trustee will solicit instructions from the Trust beneficiaries and vote all shares held in the Trust in proportion to the instructions it receives. These actions include: 
             
    an election or removal of directors in which a stockholder has properly nominated one or more candidates in opposition to a nominee or nominees of MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors or a vote on a stockholder s proposal to oppose a Board nominee for director, remove a director for cause or fill a vacancy caused by the removal of a director by stockholders, subject to certain conditions; 
                
    a merger or consolidation, a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets, or a recapitalization or dissolution, of MetLife, Inc., in each case requiring a vote of stockholders under applicable Delaware law; 
                
    any transaction that would result in an exchange or conversion of shares of common stock held by the Trust for cash, securities or other property; and 
                
    any proposal requiring MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors to amend or redeem the rights under MetLife, Inc. s stockholder rights plan, other than a proposal with respect to which we have received advice of nationally-recognized legal counsel to the effect that the proposal is not a proper subject for stockholder action under Delaware law. MetLife, Inc. does not currently have a stockholder rights plan. 
     If a vote concerns any of these fundamental corporate actions, the trustee will vote all of the shares of common stock held by the Trust in proportion to the instructions it received, which will give disproportionate weight to the instructions actually given by Trust beneficiaries. 
  The MetLife Policyholder Trust Agreement provides that we may terminate the Trust once the percentage of outstanding shares held in the Trust falls to 25%. The winding up of the Trust must commence 90 days after we provide the trustee with notice that the percentage of outstanding shares held in the Trust is 10% or less. In connection with any termination of the Trust, all of the shares of common stock then held in the Trust will need to be distributed to the respective Trust beneficiaries, unless we offer to purchase all or a portion of such Trust shares. In connection with the termination of the Trust and such a distribution, we may incur costs related to regulatory filings, mailings to Trust beneficiaries or others, and costs related to an increase in the number of shareholders, which may include increased mailing and proxy solicitation expenses. After such a distribution, the addition of the respective Trust beneficiaries to our shareholder base with full voting rights may have a significant impact on matters brought to a stockholder vote and other aspects of our corporate governance. 
  Changes in Accounting Standards Issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or Other Standard-Setting Bodies May Adversely Affect Our Financial Statements  
  Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ). The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC. See Note   1   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and official positions of the FASB are determined only after extensive due process and deliberations. Therefore, the effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. The required adoption of future accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including on our net income.

   Changes in Our Assumptions Regarding the Discount Rate, Expected Rate of Return, Mortality Rates and Expected Increase in Compensation Used for Our Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans May Result in Increased Expenses and Reduce Our Profitability 
  We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on our best estimates of future plan experience. These assumptions are reviewed regularly and include discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and expected medical inflation. Changes in these assumptions may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability. See Note   18   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on how changes in these assumptions would affect plan costs. 
  We May Not be Able to Protect Our Intellectual Property and May be Subject to Infringement Claims 
  We rely on a combination of contractual rights with third parties and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we endeavor to protect our rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. This would represent a diversion of resources that may be significant and our efforts may not prove successful. The inability to secure or protect our intellectual property assets could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete with other insurers and financial institutions. 
  In addition, we may be subject to claims by third parties for (i) patent, trademark or copyright infringement, (ii) breach of patent, trademark or copyright license usage rights, or (iii) misappropriation of trade secrets. Any such claims or resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could in some circumstances be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or from utilizing and benefiting from certain patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or implement a costly alternative. Any of these scenarios could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
  We May Be Unable to Attract and Retain Sales Representatives for Our Products 
  We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Insurers compete for sales representatives with demonstrated ability. In addition, there is competition for representatives with other types of financial services firms, such as independent broker-dealers. 
  We compete with other financial services companies for sales representatives primarily on the basis of product features, support services, compensation and financial position. We continue to undertake several initiatives to enhance the efficiency and production of our existing sales force. These initiatives may not succeed in attracting and retaining new agents. Sales of individual insurance, annuities and investment products and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining highly qualified and productive agents. See  Business   Competition.   
  State Laws, Federal Laws, Our Certificate of Incorporation and Our By-Laws May Delay, Deter or Prevent Takeovers and Business Combinations that Stockholders Might Consider in Their Best Interests 
  State laws, federal laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, such restrictions may prevent stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of MetLife, Inc. s common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of MetLife, Inc. s common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.

       Table of Contents  

   Any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would face various regulatory obstacles, including: 
             
    applicable state insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede a business combination involving us by prohibiting an entity from acquiring control (generally presumed to exist at direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of voting stock) of an insurance company domiciled in the United States without the prior approval of the domestic insurance regulator. Many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have similar regulatory approval requirements. 
                
    Dodd-Frank provisions that restrict or impede consolidations, mergers and acquisitions by systemically significant firms. See  Business       Regulation       U.S. Regulation       Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI       Enhanced Prudential Standards for Non-Bank SIFIs.   
                
    Provisions of the Investment Company Act that require approval by the contract owners of our variable contracts in order to effectuate a change of control of any affiliated investment adviser to a mutual fund underlying our variable contracts. 
                
    FINRA approval requirements for a change of control of any FINRA registered broker-dealer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. 
                
    Provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may affect the ability of an  interested stockholder  (the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation) to engage in certain business combinations for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an  interested stockholder.  
     In addition, MetLife, Inc. s certificate of incorporation and by-laws also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests or may otherwise adversely affect prevailing market prices for MetLife, Inc. s common stock. These provisions include: a prohibition on the calling of special meetings or action by written consent by stockholders; and advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates to the Board of Directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings.  
  A majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors may amend MetLife, Inc. s certificate of incorporation or by-laws. This may allow shareholders to change the Company s corporate governance and, therefore, make it more difficult for the Board of Directors to protect shareholders  interests, e.g., if they are presented with an acquisition proposal that undervalues the Company. 
    Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
  MetLife has no unresolved comments from the SEC staff regarding its periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act. 
    Item 2. Properties 
  We lease 420,000 rentable square feet in an office building in Manhattan, New York. The term of that lease commenced in February 2008 and continues until April 2029. In August 2009, we subleased 32,000 rentable square feet of that space to a subtenant, which has met our standards of review with respect to creditworthiness. We also lease 495,000 rentable square feet at 200 Park Avenue, New York (the  MetLife Building ). The term of this lease commenced in December 2015 and continues until September 2027. We also lease additional space at the MetLife Building, which includes MetLife, Inc. s boardroom. We have retained rights to existing signage for 20 years with optional renewal periods through 2205. Each of these spaces under lease is occupied by all of our segments, as well as Corporate   Other. The Company plans to consolidate its existing New York City offices to the MetLife Building, in phases, beginning in December 2016.  
  We lease 425,000 rentable square feet in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is predominantly occupied by the Retail segment, as well as Corporate   Other. The term of that lease commenced in April 2013 and continues until September 2026. We leased an additional 30,000 rentable square feet in Charlotte, North Carolina, the term of which commenced in May 2014 and expired on December 31, 2015. We lease 435,000 rentable square feet in two buildings in Cary, North Carolina, which are occupied by Global Technology   Operations, which supports all of our segments, as well as Corporate   Other. The leases for the two buildings commenced in February 2015 and April 2015, and will both continue until April 2030.  
  In December 2015, we entered into a sale-leaseback of five properties located in the U.S. with an unrelated third party. We own nine buildings in the U.S. that we use in the operation of our business. These buildings contain 2 million rentable square feet and are located in the following states: Florida, Illinois, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. Our computer center in Rensselaer, New York is not owned in fee but rather is occupied pursuant to a long-term ground lease. In addition to the aforementioned leases in New York and North Carolina, we lease space in 300 other locations throughout the U.S. Including our Long Island City, New York, facility and the lease-backs, these leased facilities consist of 6.5 million rentable square feet. Of these leases, 240 are occupied as sales offices while the balance of the space is utilized for corporate functions supporting business activities. We also own over 95 properties and lease close to 1,000 sites in various locations outside the U.S. We believe that these properties are suitable and adequate for our current and anticipated business operations.

   Forward-Looking Statements and Other Financial Information 
  For purposes of this discussion,  MetLife,  the  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. Following this summary is a discussion addressing the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company for the periods indicated. This discussion should be read in conjunction with  Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,   Risk Factors,   Selected Financial Data,   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  and the Company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. 
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.

  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to our performance measures, operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders, that are not based on GAAP. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is our measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is also a measure by which senior management s and many other employees  performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. See    Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures  for definitions of these and other measures.

   Executive Summary 
    Overview 
  MetLife is a global provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. MetLife is organized into six segments, reflecting three broad geographic regions: Retail; Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits; Corporate Benefit Funding; and Latin America (collectively, the  Americas  Asia; and EMEA. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate   Other. See  Business       Segments and Corporate   Other  and Note   2   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company s segments and Corporate   Other.   See also      Other Key Information   Significant Events    for information on the Company s announcement of its plan to pursue the Separation.   Management continues to evaluate the Company s segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.  
  Current Year Highlights 
  Overall sales growth declined from 2014 levels; however, we experienced sales growth across various products within our regions during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014. In particular, we had higher sales of retail annuity and accident   health products. A number of factors in 2015, however, offset the benefits of such sales growth, including (i) a tax charge and a related charge for interest on uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties, (ii) a decline in investment yields as a result of the sustained low interest rate environment and lower returns on other limited partnership interests, (iii) less favorable underwriting results driven by unfavorable claims experience in our property   casualty business, and (iv) a decrease in earnings as a result of our annual review of actuarial assumptions.  
  The following represents the segments  contributions to total income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, and total operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015:

    Consolidated Company Outlook  
  As part of an enterprise-wide strategic initiative, we announced that, by 2016, we expected to increase our operating return on common stockholders  equity ( operating ROE ), excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, driven by higher operating earnings. In 2016, we expect our operating ROE, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, to be approximately 11%.   
  When making projections, we must rely on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks and other uncertainties. Our assumptions have been and will continue to be impacted by (i) MetLife, Inc. s plan to pursue the Separation, (ii) regulatory uncertainty regarding capital requirements applicable to us, as a non-bank SIFI, which, among other things, impacted the level of our share repurchases, (iii) lower investment margins (primarily in the U.S.) as a result of the sustained low interest rate environment, (iv) lower than anticipated merger and acquisition activity, and (v) the impact on our foreign operations of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.

   We will need to take the above-referenced factors into account when formulating further assumptions. Due to the fact that the Separation is a significant restructuring of our business, we will not be able to further expand our outlook until we have further clarity on the nature of the Separation. The Separation is consistent with our  Accelerating Value  strategic initiative, giving greater weight to our commitments to maximize shareholder value and, subject to Board approval, regulatory constraints and acquisition opportunities, pay out our free cash flow to shareholders. 
    Other Key Information 
    Basis of Presentation 
  Certain international subsidiaries have a fiscal year cutoff of November 30   th   . Accordingly, the Company s consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries as of November 30,   2015   and   2014   and the operating results of such subsidiaries for the years ended November 30,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . The Company is in the process of converting to calendar year reporting for these subsidiaries. These conversions are expected to be substantially complete in the first quarter of 2016. The impact of the conversions on our financial statements to date has been de minimis and, therefore, has been reported in net income in the quarter of conversion. 
    Significant Events 
  On January 12, 2016, the Company announced its plan to pursue the Separation. The Company is currently evaluating structural alternatives for the proposed Separation, including a public offering of shares in an independent, publicly traded company, a spin-off, or a sale. The completion of a public offering would depend on, among other things, the SEC filing and review process, as well as market conditions. Any Separation that might occur will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval of any transaction by the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the SEC, and receipt of insurance and other regulatory approvals and other anticipated conditions.  
  In November 2014, MICC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., re-domesticated from Connecticut to Delaware, changed its name to MetLife Insurance Company USA and merged with its subsidiary, MLI-USA, and its affiliate, MLIIC, each a U.S. insurance company that issued variable annuity products in addition to other products, and Exeter, a former offshore, captive reinsurance subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. and affiliate of MICC that mainly reinsured guarantees associated with variable annuity products. The surviving entity of the Mergers was MetLife USA. The Mergers have provided increased transparency relative to our capital allocation and variable annuity risk management. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Insurance Regulation   Insurance Regulatory Examinations and Other Activities  and    Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Capital   Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions  for information on our use of captive reinsurers. 
  In October 2013, MetLife, Inc. completed its acquisition of ProVida, the largest private pension fund administrator in Chile based on assets under management and number of pension fund contributors. The acquisition of ProVida supports the Company's growth strategy in emerging markets and further strengthens the Company's overall position in Chile. See Note   3   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Industry Trends 
  We continue to be impacted by the unstable global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry. 
    Financial and Economic Environment 
  Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. Global market factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, equity, oil and commodity prices, real estate markets, foreign currency exchange rates, consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, deflation and inflation, all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our business. Disruptions in one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes. Upheavals in the financial markets can also affect our business through their effects on general levels of economic activity, employment and customer behavior. See  Risk Factors   Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks   We Are Exposed to Significant Global Financial and Capital Markets Risks Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and May Cause Our Net Investment Income to Vary from Period to Period,  and  Risk Factors   Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks   If Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally Persist, They May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.

   Weakness in the energy and metals and mining sectors and concerns about the political and/or economic stability of countries in regions outside the EU, including China, Ukraine, Russia, Argentina, Brazil, Japan and the Middle East, as well as Puerto Rico, have contributed to global market volatility. See    Investments   Current Environment   Selected Country and Sector Investments.  Concerns about global economic conditions, capital markets and the solvency of certain EU member states and Europe s perimeter region, their banking systems and the financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by these countries or their respective banking systems, have also been a cause of elevated levels of market volatility. See    Investments   Current Environment  for information regarding our exposure to obligations of European governments, European private obligors and Europe s perimeter region. Contributing to such volatility are concerns that such countries could default on their obligations, have to restructure their outstanding debt, or that financial institutions with significant holdings of sovereign or private debt of such countries, including Europe s perimeter region, could experience financial stress, any of which could have significant adverse effects on the European and global economies and on financial markets, generally. While economic conditions in certain of these countries, including Europe s perimeter region seem to be stabilizing or improving, there is still concern that any support measures could affect the Euro exchange rate and have uncertain impacts on interest rates and risk markets.  
  In an effort to further stabilize the European financial crisis, in December 2015, the European Central Bank ( ECB ) extended its quantitative easing program until at least March 2017. These measures have included cutting interest rates to negative levels, providing inexpensive financing facilities designed to incentivize banks to extend loans, buying private sector asset-backed securities and covered bonds and extending its asset purchase program to include  60 billion per month of ECB purchases of local and regional debt, as well as sovereign debt on secondary markets. Such actions are intended to lessen the risk of deflation, lower borrowing costs in the Euro zone and encourage corporations to issue more asset-backed securities. 
  We face substantial exposure to the Japanese economy given our operations there. Structural weaknesses and debt sustainability have yet to be addressed effectively. Going forward, Japan s structural and demographic challenges may continue to limit its potential growth unless reforms that boost productivity are put into place. Japan s high public sector debt levels are mitigated by low refinancing risks and its nominal yields on government debt have remained at a lower level than that of any other developed country. However, frequent changes in government have prevented policy makers from implementing fiscal reform measures to put public finances on a sustainable path. To avert deflation and to achieve sustainable economic growth, the government and the Bank of Japan have implemented a coordinated strategy which includes the imposition of a negative rate on commercial bank deposits, increased government bond purchases at longer maturities and tax reform, including the lowering of the Japanese corporate tax rate by approximately 2% and the delay until 2017 of an increase in the consumption tax to 10%. As a result of the decrease in the corporate tax rate, the Company recorded a one-time benefit of $174 million in the second quarter of 2015, which included an increase in Asia s operating earnings of $61 million. This tax law change favorably affected our annual effective tax rate for 2015 by approximately 0.3% as compared to 2014. 
    Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment  
  As a global insurance company, we are affected by the monetary policy of central banks around the world, as well as the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board in the United States. The Federal Reserve Board has taken a number of actions in recent years to spur economic activity, including asset purchases and keeping interest rates low. However, in October 2014, the Federal Reserve Board s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ), citing strength in the economy and substantial improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, decided to conclude the asset purchase program. In December 2015, the FOMC increased the federal funds rate for the first time in 10 years and held it steady at its January 2016 meeting. Further increases in the federal funds rate in the future may affect interest rates and risk markets in the U.S. and other developed and emerging economies. See    Financial and Economic Environment  for information regarding accommodative and other policy measures pursued by the ECB and the Bank of Japan. However, we cannot predict with certainty the effect of these programs and policies on interest rates or the impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments at this time. See    Investments   Current Environment.  
  In periods of declining interest rates, we may have to invest insurance cash flows and reinvest the cash flows we received as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities, commercial, agricultural or residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates. Therefore, some of our products expose us to the risk that a reduction in interest rates will reduce the difference between the amounts that we are required to credit on contracts in our general account and the rate of return we are able to earn on investments intended to support obligations under these contracts. This difference between interest earned and interest credited, or margin, is a key metric for the management of, and reporting for, many of our businesses.

   Our expectations regarding future margins are an important component impacting the amortization of certain intangible assets such as DAC and VOBA. Significantly lower margins may cause us to accelerate the amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. Additionally, lower margins may also impact the recoverability of intangible assets such as goodwill, require the establishment of additional liabilities or trigger loss recognition events on certain policyholder liabilities. We review this long-term margin assumption, along with other assumptions, as part of our annual assumption review. 
    Mitigating Actions 
  The Company continues to be proactive in its investment and interest crediting rate strategies, as well as its product design and product mix. To mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences from the low interest rate environment in the U.S., the Company applies disciplined asset/liability management ( ALM ) strategies, including the use of derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, floors and swaptions. A significant portion of these derivatives were entered into prior to the onset of the current low U.S. interest rate environment. In some cases, the Company has entered into offsetting positions as part of its overall ALM strategy and to reduce volatility in net income. Lowering interest crediting rates on some products, or adjusting the dividend scale on traditional products, can help offset decreases in investment margins on some products. Our ability to lower interest crediting rates could be limited by competition, requirements to obtain regulatory approval, or contractual guarantees of minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our margins could decrease or potentially become negative. We are able to limit or close certain products to new sales in order to manage exposures. Business actions, such as shifting the sales focus to less interest rate sensitive products, can also mitigate this risk. In addition, the Company is well diversified across product, distribution, and geography. Certain of our non-U.S. businesses, reported within our Latin America and EMEA segments, which accounted for approximately 15% of our operating earnings in 2015, are not significantly interest rate or market sensitive; in particular, they do not have any direct sensitivity to U.S. interest rates. The Company s primary exposure within these segments is insurance risk. We expect our non-U.S. businesses to grow faster than our U.S. businesses and, over time, to become a larger percentage of our total business. As a result of the foregoing, the Company expects to be able to substantially mitigate the negative impact of a sustained low interest rate environment in the U.S. on the Company s profitability. Based on a near to intermediate term analysis of a sustained lower interest rate environment in the U.S., the Company anticipates operating earnings will continue to increase, although at a slower growth rate. 
    Low Interest Rate Scenario    
  In formulating its insurance contract assumptions, the Company uses projections that it makes regarding interest rates. Included in these assumptions is the projection that the 10-year Treasury rate will rise from 2.27% at December 31, 2015 to 4.50% in 11 years, by 2026 and that 10-year yields will reach 2.78%, 3.07% and 3.21% by December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Also included is the projection that the three-month LIBOR rate will move from 0.61% at December 31, 2015 to 1.32%, 1.81% and 1.76% by December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. However, due to the significant decline in the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate below 2.00% subsequent to December 2015, we have revised the hypothetical low interest rate scenario on our 2016, 2017 and   2018   operating earnings for the total Company, as well as each segment and Corporate   Other, that would be significantly affected by changes in LIBOR and U.S. interest rates,   but without the effect of the proposed Separation (described in further detail in Note 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The revised low interest rate scenario reflects a decrease in the   assumed constant 10-Year U.S. Treasury rate from 2.00% to 1.50% with the corresponding consensus of interest rate views and credit spreads (the  Low Interest Rate Scenario ). 
  The following summarizes the impact of the Low Interest Rate Scenario. In addition, we have included disclosure on the potential impact on 2016, 2017 and   2018   net income using the same Low Interest Rate Scenario on the mark-to-market of derivative positions that do not qualify as accounting hedges. 
    81 

     Table of Contents  

   Below is a summary of the rates we used for the Low Interest Rate Scenario versus our business plan through 2018. These rates represent the most relevant short-term and long-term rates for our business plan. 

The Low Interest Rate Scenario assumes three-month LIBOR to be 0.24% and the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate to be 1.50% at December 31,     2015     and remain constant at those levels until December 31,     2018  . We make similar assumptions for interest rates at other maturities, and hold this interest rate curve constant through December 31,     2018  . In addition, in the Interest Rate Scenario, we assume credit spreads remain constant from December     2015     through the end of     2018     as compared to our business plan which assumes rising credit spreads through     2016     and thereafter remaining constant through the end of     2018  . Further, we also include the impact of low interest rates on our pension and postretirement plan expenses. We allocate this impact across our segments and it is included in the segment discussion below. The discount rate used to value these plans is tied to high quality corporate bond yields. Accordingly, an extended low interest rate environment will result in increased pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities.     However, these liabilities are offset by corresponding returns on the fixed income portfolio of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets resulting in an overall decrease in expense. 
    Hypothetical Impact to Operating Earnings 
  Based on the above assumptions, we estimate an unfavorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on our consolidated operating earnings from the Low Interest Rate Scenario of approximately $65 million in   2016  , $210 million   2017   and $375 million in   2018  . Under the Low Interest Rate Scenario, our long-term businesses are negatively impacted by the larger gap between new money yields and the yield on assets rolling off the portfolio. However, there are positive offsets under the Low Interest Rate Scenario as short-term rates are much lower than the business plan rates and the yield curve is steeper than that of the business plan. For example, our securities lending business performs better than our business plan because it is driven by the slope of the yield curve rather than by the level of interest rates. In addition, derivative income is higher primarily due to our receiver swaps where we receive a fixed rate and pay a floating rate. 
  In addition to its impact on operating earnings, we estimated the effect of the Low Interest Rate Scenario on the mark-to-market of our derivative positions that do not qualify as accounting hedges. We applied the Low Interest Rate Scenario to these derivatives and compared the impact to that from interest rates in our business plan. We hold a significant position in long duration receive-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge reinvestment risk. These swaps are most sensitive to the 30-year and 10-year swap rates and we recognize gains as rates drop and recognize losses as rates rise. This estimated impact on the derivative mark-to-market does not include that of our VA program derivatives as the impact of low interest rates in the freestanding derivatives would be largely offset by the mark-to-market in net derivative gains (losses) for the related embedded derivative. 
    Hypothetical Impact to Our Mark-to-Market Derivative Positions 
  Based on these additional assumptions, we estimate the combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact of the Low Interest Rate Scenario on the mark-to-market of our derivative positions that do not qualify as accounting hedges to be an increase in net income of $530 million and $40 million in   2016   and   2017  , respectively, and a decrease in net income of $90 million in   2018  . See    Results of Operations   Consolidated Results  for information regarding our actual gains and losses on the Company s non-VA program derivatives due to interest rate changes (U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar denominated instruments) which are included in net income. 
    Segments and Corporate   Other 
  The following discussion summarizes the impact of the above Low Interest Rate Scenario on the operating earnings of our segments, as well as Corporate   Other. See also    Policyholder Liabilities   Policyholder Account Balances  for information regarding the account values subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates. 
    82 

     Table of Contents  

   Retail 
  Life   Other   Our interest rate sensitive products include traditional life, universal life, and retained asset accounts. Because the majority of our traditional life insurance business is participating, we can largely offset lower investment returns on assets backing our traditional life products through adjustments to the applicable dividend scale. In our universal life products, we manage interest rate risk through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies, including the use of hedges such as interest rate swaps and floors. While we have the ability to lower crediting rates on certain in-force universal life policies to mitigate margin compression, such actions would be partially offset by increases in our liabilities related to policies with secondary guarantees. Our retained asset accounts have minimum interest crediting rate guarantees which range from 0.5% to 4.0%, all of which are currently at their respective minimum interest crediting rates. While we expect to experience margin compression as we reinvest at lower rates, the interest rate derivatives held in this portfolio will partially mitigate this risk. 
  Annuities   The impact on operating earnings from margin compression is concentrated in our deferred annuities where there are minimum interest rate guarantees. Under the Low Interest Rate Scenario, we assume that a larger percentage of customers will maintain their funds with us to take advantage of the attractive minimum guaranteed crediting rates and we expect to experience margin compression as we reinvest cash flows at lower interest rates. Partially offsetting this margin compression, we assume we will lower crediting rates on contractual reset dates for the portion of business that is not currently at minimum crediting rates. Additionally, we have various derivative positions, primarily interest rate floors, to partially mitigate this risk.  
  Reinvestment risk is defined for this purpose as the amount of reinvestment in   2016  ,   2017   and   2018   that would impact operating earnings due to reinvesting cash flows in the Low Interest Rate Scenario. For the deferred annuities business, $2.1 billion, $2.1 billion, and $0.4 billion in   2016  ,   2017  , and   2018  , respectively, of the asset base will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of $36.7 billion, $37.5 billion and $38.2 billion in   2016  ,   2017   and 2018, respectively. 
  We estimate an unfavorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on the operating earnings of our Retail segment from the Low Interest Rate Scenario of $10 million, $65 million and $165 million in   2016  ,   2017   and   2018  , respectively. 
  Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits 
  Group   In general, most of our group life insurance products in this segment are renewable term insurance and, therefore, have significant repricing flexibility. Interest rate risk arises mainly from minimum interest rate guarantees on retained asset accounts. These accounts have minimum interest crediting rate guarantees which range from 0.5% to 3.0%. All of these account balances are currently at their respective minimum interest crediting rates and we would expect to experience margin compression as we reinvest at lower interest rates. We have used interest rate floors to partially mitigate the risks of a sustained U.S. low interest rate environment. We also have exposure to interest rate risk in this business arising from our group disability policy claim reserves. For these products, lower reinvestment rates cannot be offset by a reduction in liability crediting rates for established claim reserves. Group disability policies are generally renewable term policies. Rates may be adjusted on in-force policies at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and current interest rate assumptions. We review the discount rate assumptions and other assumptions associated with our long-term disability claim reserves no less frequently than annually. Our most recent review at the end of 2015 resulted in no change to the applicable discount rates. 
  Voluntary   Worksite   We have exposure to interest rate risk in this business arising mainly from our long-term care policy reserves. For these products, lower reinvestment rates cannot be offset by a reduction in liability crediting rates for established claim reserves. Long-term care policies are guaranteed renewable, and rates may be adjusted on a class basis with regulatory approval to reflect emerging experience. Our long-term care block is closed to new business. The Company makes use of derivative instruments to more closely match asset and liability duration and immunize the portfolio against changes in interest rates. Reinvestment risk is defined for this purpose as the amount of reinvestment in   2016  ,   2017   and   2018   that would impact operating earnings due to reinvesting cash flows in the Low Interest Rate Scenario. For the long-term care portfolio, $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion of the asset base in   2016  ,   2017   and   2018  , respectively, will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of $10.5 billion, $11.2 billion and $11.8 billion in   2016  ,   2017   and   2018  , respectively. 
  We estimate a favorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on the operating earnings of our Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits segment from the Low Interest Rate Scenario of $5 million in   2016   and an unfavorable impact of $10 million and $45 million   2017   and   2018  , respectively.

     Table of Contents  

   Corporate Benefit Funding 
  This segment contains both short and long duration products consisting of capital market products, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, and other benefit funding products. The majority of short duration products are managed on a floating rate basis, which mitigates the impact of the low interest rate environment in the U.S. The long duration products have very predictable cash flows and we have matched these cash flows through our ALM strategies. We also use interest rate swaps to help protect income in this segment against a low interest rate environment in the U.S. Based on the cash flow estimates, only a small component is subject to reinvestment risk. Reinvestment risk is defined for this purpose as the amount of reinvestment in   2016  ,   2017   and   2018   that would impact operating earnings due to reinvesting cash flows in the Low Interest Rate Scenario. For the long duration business, $0.6 billion of the asset base in   2016   will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of $60.6 billion. In   2017   and   2018  , none of the asset base will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of $63.9 billion and $66.5 billion, respectively. 
  We estimate an unfavorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on operating earnings on our Corporate Benefit Funding segment from the Low Interest Rate Scenario of $5 million, $30 million and $45 million in   2016  ,   2017   and   2018  , respectively. 
  Asia 
  Our Asia segment has a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar denominated assets. 
  Life   Other   Our Japan business offers traditional life insurance and accident   health products. To the extent the Japan life insurance portfolio is U.S. interest rate and LIBOR sensitive and we are unable to lower crediting rates to the customer, operating earnings will decline. We manage interest rate risk on our life products through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies. 
  Annuities   We sell annuities in Asia which are predominantly single premium products with crediting rates set at the time of issue. This allows us to tightly manage product ALM, cash flows and net spreads, thus maintaining profitability. 
  We estimate an unfavorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on the operating earnings of our Asia segment from the Low Interest Rate Scenario of $25 million, $50 million and $60 million in   2016  ,   2017   and   2018  , respectively. 
  Corporate   Other 
  Corporate   Other contains the surplus portfolios for the enterprise, the portfolios used to fund the capital needs of the Company and various reinsurance agreements. The surplus portfolios are subject to reinvestment risk; however, lower net investment income is significantly offset by lower interest expense on both fixed and variable rate debt. Under a lower interest rate environment, fixed rate debt is assumed to be either paid off when it matures or refinanced at a lower interest rate resulting in lower overall interest expense. Variable rate debt is indexed to the three-month LIBOR, which results in lower interest expense incurred. 
  We estimate an unfavorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on the operating earnings of Corporate   Other from the Low Interest Rate Scenario of $30 million, $55 million and $60 million in   2016  ,   2017   and   2018  , respectively. 
    Competitive Pressures 
  The life insurance industry remains highly competitive. The product development and product life cycles have shortened in many product segments, leading to more intense competition with respect to product features. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology and risk management, which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. In addition, several of the industry s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Sufficient scale, financial strength and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. We believe that the continued volatility of the financial markets, its impact on the capital position of many competitors, and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have altered the competitive environment. In particular, we believe that these factors have highlighted financial strength as the most significant differentiator from the perspective of some customers and certain distributors. We believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this environment.

   Regulatory Developments 
  In the U.S., our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry. In addition, regulators have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities, variable annuities and group products, as well as reviews of the utilization of affiliated captive reinsurers and offshore entities to reinsure insurance risks. 
  The regulation of the global financial services industry has received renewed scrutiny as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets. Significant regulatory reforms have been adopted and additional reforms proposed, and these or other reforms could be implemented. See  Business   Regulation,   Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth,   Risk Factors   Risks Related to Our Business   Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings May Be Subject to Cost Increases and New Financings May Be Subject to Limited Market Capacity,  and  Risk Factors   Regulatory and Legal Risks   Changes in U.S. Federal, State Securities and State Insurance Laws and Regulations May Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability.  For example, Dodd-Frank, which was signed by President Obama in July 2010, effected the most far-reaching overhaul of financial regulation in the U.S. in decades. The full impact of Dodd-Frank on us will depend on the numerous rulemaking initiatives required or permitted by Dodd-Frank which are in various stages of implementation, many of which are not likely to be completed for some time. 
    Mortgage and Foreclosure-Related Exposures  
  MetLife no longer engages in the origination, sale and servicing of forward and reverse residential mortgage loans. See Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our mortgage and foreclosure-related exposures. 
  Notwithstanding MetLife Bank s exit from the origination and servicing businesses, MLHL remains obligated to repurchase loans or compensate for losses upon demand due to alleged defects by MetLife Bank or its predecessor servicers in past servicing of the loans and material representations made in connection with MetLife Bank s sale of the loans.     Reserves for representation and warranty repurchases and indemnifications were $72 million and $85 million at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Reserves for estimated future losses due to alleged deficiencies on loans originated and sold, as well as servicing of the loans including servicing acquired, are estimated based on unresolved claims and projected losses under investor servicing contracts where MetLife Bank s past actions or inactions are likely to result in missing certain stipulated investor timelines. Reserves for servicing defects were $31 million and $38 million at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Management is satisfied that adequate provision has been made in the Company s consolidated financial statements for those representation and warranty obligations that are currently probable and reasonably estimable. 
    Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note   1   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining: 
                 (i) 
    liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance; 
      (ii) 
    capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA; 
      (iii) 
    estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values; 
      (iv) 
    investment impairments; 
      (v) 
    estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation;  
      (vi) 
    measurement of goodwill and related impairment; 
      (vii) 
    measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities; 
      (viii) 
    measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and 
      (xi) 
    liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.

   In addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed   the most significant of which relate to aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying our accounting policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
    Liability for Future Policy Benefits 
  Generally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims. 
  Future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest. 
  Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation. 
  Future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for ULSG and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S P 500 Index. 
  We regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses. 
  See Note   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits. 
    Reinsurance 
  Accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See    Investment Impairments.  Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting. 
  See Note   6   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.

   Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired 
  We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are deferred as DAC. In addition to commissions, certain direct-response advertising expenses and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee s total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee s time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis or more frequently to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods. 
  VOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in force at the acquisition date. For certain acquired blocks of business, the estimated fair value of the in-force contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed in-force insurance policy liabilities, resulting in negative VOBA, which is presented separately from VOBA as an additional insurance liability included in other policy-related balances. The estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business. 
  Separate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $200 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 7.25%. 
  We also periodically review other long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease. 
  Our most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.

       Table of Contents  

   At December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , DAC and VOBA for the Company was $24.1 billion, $24.4 billion and $26.7 billion, respectively. Amortization of DAC and VOBA associated with the variable and universal life and the annuity contracts was significantly impacted by movements in equity markets. The following illustrates the effect on DAC and VOBA of changing each of the respective assumptions, as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . Increases (decreases) in DAC and VOBA balances, as presented below, resulted in a corresponding decrease (increase) in amortization. 

The following represent significant items contributing to the changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in   2015  : 
             
    Changes in net investment and net derivative gains (losses) resulted in the following changes in DAC and VOBA amortization: 
                
    Actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities, resulting in a decrease of DAC and VOBA amortization of $338 million, excluding the impact from our nonperformance risk and risk margins, which are described below. Mark-to-market changes on the freestanding derivatives hedging such guarantee obligations resulted in an increase in DAC and VOBA amortization of $114 million. 
                
    The Company s nonperformance risk adjustment decreased the valuation of guaranteed liabilities, increased actual gross profits and increased DAC and VOBA amortization by $17 million. This was partially offset by the lower risk margins, which increased the guarantee liability valuations, decreased actual gross profits and decreased DAC and VOBA amortization by $10 million. 
                
    The remainder of the impact increased DAC and VOBA amortization by $226 million and was attributable to   2015   investment activities, methodology refinement  , and assumption updates.    
                
    The change in GMIBs resulted in an increase to DAC amortization of $125 million mostly attributable to hedge gains.  
                
    Better than expected persistency and updates in persistency assumptions caused an increase in actual and expected future gross profits resulting in a net decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization of $220 million. 
       88 

       Table of Contents  

   The following represent significant items contributing to the changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in   2014  : 
             
    The increase in equity markets during the year increased separate account balances, which led to higher actual and expected future gross profits on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting in a decrease of $43 million in DAC and VOBA amortization. 
        Changes in net investment gains (losses) resulted in the following changes in DAC and VOBA amortization. 
             
    Actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities, resulting in a decrease of DAC and VOBA amortization of $118 million, excluding the impact from our nonperformance risk and risk margins, which are described below. This decrease in actual gross profits was more than offset by freestanding net derivative gains associated with the hedging of such guarantee obligations, which resulted in an increase in DAC and VOBA amortization of $219 million. 
                
    The widening of the Company s nonperformance risk adjustment decreased the valuation of guaranteed liabilities, increased actual gross profits and increased DAC and VOBA amortization by $44 million. This was more than offset by the higher risk margins, which increased the guarantee liability valuations, decreased actual gross profits and decreased DAC and VOBA amortization by $53 million. 
                
    The remainder of the impact of net investment gains (losses), which decreased DAC and VOBA amortization by $50 million, was primarily attributable to   2014   investment activities. 
                
    The change in current and future projected GMIBs liability resulted in an increase to DAC amortization of $63 million.  
                
    Better than expected persistency and changes in assumptions regarding persistency caused an increase in actual and expected future gross profits resulting in a net decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization of $94 million. 
     The following represent significant items contributing to the changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in   2013  : 
             
    The increase in equity markets during the year increased separate account balances, which led to higher actual and expected future gross profits on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting in a decrease of $157 million in DAC and VOBA amortization. 
                
    Changes in net investment gains (losses) resulted in the following changes in DAC and VOBA amortization: 
                 
    Actual gross profits increased as a result of a decrease in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities, resulting in an increase of DAC and VOBA amortization of $1.1 billion, excluding the impact from our nonperformance risk and risk margins, which are described below. This increase in actual gross profits was more than offset by freestanding derivative losses associated with the hedging of such guarantee obligations, which resulted in a decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization of $1.2 billion. 
                 
    The tightening of our nonperformance risk adjustment increased the valuation of guarantee liabilities, decreased actual gross profits and decreased DAC and VOBA amortization by $94 million. This was partially offset by lower risk margins, which decreased the guarantee liability valuations, increased actual gross profits and increased DAC and VOBA amortization by $60 million. 
                
    The remainder of the impact of net investment gains (losses), which decreased DAC and VOBA amortization by $72 million, was primarily attributable to   2013   investment activities.  
                
    The hedging and reinsurance losses associated with the insurance liabilities of the GMIBs decreased actual gross profits and decreased DAC and VOBA amortization by $349 million. 
     Our DAC and VOBA balance is also impacted by unrealized investment gains (losses) and the amount of amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and losses had been realized. The decrease in unrealized investment gains (losses) increased the DAC and VOBA balance by $638 million in 2015, while the change in unrealized investment gains decreased the DAC and VOBA balance by $702 million and increased the DAC and VOBA balance by $1.3 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Notes   5   and   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the DAC and VOBA offset to unrealized investment losses.

   Estimated Fair Value of Investments 
  In determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments. 
  The methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments. 
    Investment Impairments 
  One of the significant estimates related to AFS securities is our impairment evaluation. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value on a security-by-security basis. Our review of each fixed maturity and equity security for OTTI includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and/or age of gross unrealized loss. An extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments. Accordingly, such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected. In contrast, for certain equity securities, greater weight and consideration are given to a decline in estimated fair value and the likelihood such estimated fair value decline will recover. 
  Additionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Factors we consider in the OTTI evaluation process are described in Note   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. 
  See Notes   1   and   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowances and impairments. 
    Derivatives 
  The determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.

     Table of Contents  

   We issue variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which are embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc. s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees. 
  The table below illustrates the impact that a range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads would have on our consolidated balance sheet, excluding the effect of income tax, related to the embedded derivative valuation on certain variable annuity products measured at estimated fair value. However, these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables, such as equity price levels and market volatility, which can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values. Therefore, the table does not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statement under the credit spread variance scenarios presented below. 
  In determining the ranges, we have considered current market conditions, as well as the market level of spreads that can reasonably be anticipated over the near term. The ranges do not reflect extreme market conditions such as those experienced during the 2008-2009 financial crisis as we do not consider those to be reasonably likely events in the near future. 

The accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice. If it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially affected. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income. 
  Variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our nonperformance risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. If interpretations change, there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income. 
    91 

     Table of Contents  

   Additionally, we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. Because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and, thus are not accounted for at fair value, significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee. 
  See Note   9   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs. 
    Goodwill 
  Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. 
  For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In such instances, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition. The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative assessment or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative assessment is an assessment of historical information and relevant events and circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all of its reporting units and instead perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. In performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the Company may use a market multiple valuation approach and a discounted cash flow valuation approach. For reporting units which are particularly sensitive to market assumptions, the Company may use additional valuation methodologies to estimate the reporting units  fair values. The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected operating earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, control premium, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewal business, as well as margins on such business, the level of interest rates, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit. 
  During the 2015, 2014 and 2013 annual goodwill impairment tests, we concluded that the fair values of all reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired. 
  We apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. 
  See Note   11   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our goodwill. 
    Employee Benefit Plans 
  Certain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. sponsor and/or administer various plans that provide defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits covering eligible employees and sales representatives. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams. 
    92 

     Table of Contents  

   We determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. Given the amount of plan assets as of   December 31, 2014   the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $103 million and an increase of $103 million, respectively, in   2015  . This considers only changes in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return. 
  We determine the discount rates used to value the pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. Given our pension and postretirement obligations as of   December 31, 2014  , the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $133 million and an increase of $155 million, respectively, in   2015  . This considers only changes in our assumed discount rates without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity. 
  See Note   18   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans. 
    Income Taxes 
  We provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. 
  In establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.  
  Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. See Note   1   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances. 
  We may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the financial statements in the year these changes occur. 
  See Notes   1   and   19   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.

   Litigation Contingencies 
  We are a party to a number of legal actions and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to estimate the impact on our financial position. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. The data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate our asbestos-related liability include the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against us when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. 
  See Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies. 
    Economic Capital 
  Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in our business. 
  Our economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife s management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards. 
  Segment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact our consolidated net investment income, operating earnings or income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax. 
  Net investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment s specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company s product pricing. 
    Acquisitions and Dispositions 
  In 2014, the life insurance joint venture in Vietnam among MetLife, Inc. (through MetLife Limited), Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment   Development of Vietnam and Bank for Investment   Development of Vietnam Insurance Joint Stock Corporation was established. Operations of the joint venture (BIDV MetLife Life Insurance Limited Liability Company) commenced in 2014. 
  In 2014, MetLife, Inc. and Malaysia s AMMB Holdings Bhd ( AMMB ) completed the formation of their strategic partnership, in which each holds approximately 50% of both AmMetLife Insurance Berhad and AmMetTakaful Berhad, each of which became parties to exclusive 20-year distribution agreements with AMMB bank affiliates.

   Results of Operations 
    Consolidated Results    
  Business Overview.   Overall sales declined from 2014 levels; however, sales experience was positive across various products within our regions for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The introduction of new variable annuity products in late 2014 and early 2015, as well as pricing actions and our continued focus on our enhanced underwriting programs, all contributed to higher sales in our Retail segment. For our Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits segment,   2015 sales were slightly higher, as improved sales of voluntary products were largely offset by lower sales of our core group products as a result of increased competition.   Despite the decline in funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S P 500 companies, we experienced an increase in sales of pension risk transfers. However, more competitive pricing in the market drove a decrease in structured settlement annuity sales.   Total sales for our Latin America segment decreased primarily due to the impact of a large contract in Mexico in 2014. Excluding this contract, sales for the region increased due to organic growth in several countries.   Sales in our EMEA segment improved, while sales in our Asia segment declined slightly.

   Year Ended December 31,   2015   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2014 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, income (loss) from continuing operations, before provision for income tax, decreased $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion, net of income tax) from 2014 primarily due to an unfavorable change in operating earnings, driven by the aforementioned tax charge and related charge for interest on uncertain tax positions, and an unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses), partially offset by a favorable change in net investment gains (losses). 
  Management of Investment Portfolio and Hedging Market Risks with Derivatives  .   We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined ALM principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. We also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels. In addition, our general account investment portfolio includes, within FVO and trading securities, contractholder-directed unit-linked investments supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities, which do not qualify as separate account assets. The returns on these contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, which can vary significantly from period to period, include changes in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase, inure to contractholders and are offset in earnings by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances. 
  We purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold. 
  We use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. Certain of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. 
  Certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). We use freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. The valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us.

       Table of Contents  

   Net Derivative Gains (Losses)  . The variable annuity embedded derivatives and associated freestanding derivative hedges are collectively referred to as  VA program derivatives  in the following table. All other derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as  non-VA program derivatives  in the following table. The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives: 

The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $386 million ($251 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to long-term interest rates decreasing less in 2015 than in 2014, unfavorably impacting receive-fixed interest rate swaptions and interest rate swaps primarily hedging long duration liability portfolios.  
  These unfavorable changes were partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other key currencies favorably impacting foreign currency forwards and futures that primarily hedge foreign denominated fixed maturity securities. In addition, a change in the value of the underlying assets favorably impacted non-VA embedded derivatives related to funds withheld on a certain reinsurance agreement. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged. 
  The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $893 million ($580 million, net of income tax). This was due to an unfavorable change of $685 million ($445 million, net of income tax) in other risks in embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change of $358 million ($233 million, net of income tax) in market risks in embedded derivatives, net of the impact of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, partially offset by a favorable change of $150 million ($98 million, net of income tax) related to the change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged. 
  The foregoing $685 million ($445 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in other risks in embedded derivatives reflecte  d: 
             
    Refinements in the valuation model, which resulted in an unfavorable year over year change in the valuation of the embedded derivatives. 
                
    The cross effect of capital markets changes, which resulted in an unfavorable year over year change in the valuation of the embedded derivatives. 
                
    A combination of other factors, including reserve changes influenced by benefit features and policyholder behavior, as well as FCTA, which resulted in an unfavorable year over year change in the valuation of embedded derivatives. 
       97 

       Table of Contents  

   The foregoing $358 million ($233 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change was comprised of an $838 million ($545 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives, which was partially offset by a $480 million ($312 million, net of income tax) favorable change in market risks in embedded derivatives.  
  The primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows: 
             
    Long-term interest rates decreased less in 2015 than in 2014, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate decreased by 3% in 2015 and 31% in 2014. 
                
    Key equity index levels decreased in 2015 and increased in 2014, contributing to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the S P 500 Index decreased by 1% in 2015 and increased by 11% in 2014. 
                
    Changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives related to the assumed reinsurance of certain variable annuity products from the Company s former operating joint venture in Japan. For example, the Japanese yen strengthened against the euro by 10% in 2015 as compared with a weakening of less than 1% against the euro in 2014. 
     The aforementioned $150 million ($98 million, net of income tax) favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives was due to a favorable change of $148 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread and a favorable change of $2 million, before income tax, as a result of changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on the variable annuity guarantees. 
  When equity index levels decrease in isolation, the variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk. 
  When the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk. 
  When our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. As a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk. For each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when they move in the opposite direction. 
  Net Investment Gains (Losses).   The favorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $794 million ($516 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects a loss in 2014 on the disposition of MAL and higher net gains on sales of real estate in 2015, partially offset by lower net gains on sales and disposals of fixed maturity securities in 2015.   For further information on MAL, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Actuarial Assumption Review.   Results for 2015 include a $313 million ($203 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and DAC, of which a $3 million loss ($2 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $313 million charge, $60 million ($39 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $253 million ($164 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves.  
  The $3 million loss recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual assumption review was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives caption in the table above. 
    98 

       Table of Contents  

   As a result of our annual assumption review, changes were made to economic, policyholder behavior, mortality and other assumptions. The most significant impacts were in the Retail Life and Annuity blocks of business and are summarized as follows: 
             
    Changes in economic assumptions resulted in an increase of DAC and reserves, resulting in a net charge of $122 million ($79 million, net of income tax).  
                
    Changes in policyholder behavior and mortality assumptions resulted in reserve increases, offset by favorable DAC, resulting in a net charge of $91 million ($59 million, net of income tax).  
                
    The remaining updates resulted in an increase in reserves, coupled with unfavorable DAC, resulting in a charge of $100 million ($65 million, net of income tax). The most notable update was related to our projection of closed block results.  
     Results for 2014 include a $161 million ($105 million, net of income tax) benefit associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and DAC, of which $137 million ($89 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $161 million benefit, $82 million ($53 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $79 million ($52 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves.  
  Taxes  . Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.1 billion, or 29% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, compared with $2.5 billion, or 28% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company s 2015 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Our 2015 results include one-time tax charges of $681 million, of which $557 million was recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties, $88 million was related to foreign exchange-related gains on investments in Argentina and $36 million was the result of a deferred tax liability true-up in Japan. These charges were partially offset by one-time tax benefits of $174 million in Japan related to a change in tax rate, $61 million related to restructuring in Chile, $57 million related to the repatriation of earnings from Japan and $31 million related to the devaluation of the peso in Argentina. The Company s 2014 effective tax rate was different from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rate, and the tax effects of the MAL divestiture. The 2014 period also includes a $54 million tax charge related to tax reform in Chile, a $45 million tax charge related to the repatriation of earnings from Japan and an $18 million tax charge related to a portion of the aforementioned settlement of a licensing matter which was not deductible for income tax purposes, partially offset by a $32 million one-time tax benefit related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return. 
  Operating Earnings  .   As more fully described in    Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures,  we use operating earnings, which does not equate to income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance, and allocate resources. We believe that the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders should not be viewed as substitutes for income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, and net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc. s common shareholders, respectively. Operating earnings available to common shareholders decreased $1.1 billion, net of income tax, to $5.5 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended   December 31, 2015   from $6.6 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended   December 31, 2014  . 
    Year Ended December 31,   2014   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2013 
  During the year ended December 31, 2014, income (loss) from continuing operations, before provision for income tax, increased $4.8 billion ($2.9 billion, net of income tax) from 2013 primarily driven by a favorable change in net derivative gains (losses), partially offset by an unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses). Income (loss) from continuing operations, before provision for income tax also reflects a $262 million ($174 million, net of income tax) favorable change as a result of our annual assumption reviews related to reserves and DAC.

   Net Derivative Gains (Losses).     The variable annuity embedded derivatives and associated freestanding derivative hedges are collectively referred to as  VA program derivatives  in the following table. All other derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as  non-VA program derivatives  in the following table. The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives: 

The favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $3.4 billion ($2.2 billion, net of income tax). This was primarily due to long-term interest rates decreasing in 2014 and increasing in 2013, favorably impacting receive-fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions. These freestanding derivatives were primarily hedging long duration liability portfolios. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other key currencies, as well as the Japanese yen weakening less against the U.S. dollar in 2014 versus 2013, favorably impacted foreign currency swaps and forwards that primarily hedge foreign denominated fixed maturity securities. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged. 
  The favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $1.1 billion ($742 million, net of income tax). This was due to a favorable change of $965 million ($627 million, net of income tax) related to the change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives and a favorable change of $273 million ($178 million, net of income tax) on market risks in embedded derivatives, net of the impact of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, partially offset by an unfavorable change of $97 million ($63 million, net of income tax) on other risks in embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged. 
  The aforementioned $965 million ($627 million, net of income tax) favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment was due to a favorable change of $629 million, before income tax, as a result of changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on the variable annuity guarantees, as well as a favorable change of $336 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread. 
  The foregoing $273 million ($178 million, net of income tax) favorable change was comprised of a $6.3 billion ($4.1 billion, net of income tax) favorable change in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives, which was largely offset by a $6.1 billion ($3.9 billion, net of income tax) unfavorable change in market risks in embedded derivatives. 
    100 

     Table of Contents  

   The primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows: 
             
    Long-term interest rates decreased in 2014 and increased in 2013, contributing to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate decreased by 31% in 2014 and increased by 40% in 2013. 
                 
    Changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen by 14% in 2014 as compared with 22% in 2013. 
     The foregoing $97 million ($63 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in other risks in embedded derivatives was primarily due to an increase in the risk margin adjustment caused by higher policyholder behavior risks, along with updates to the actuarial assumptions, partially offset by favorable changes in all other risk factors. 
  Net Investment Gains (Losses).   The unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $358 million ($233 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects a 2014 loss on the disposition of MAL, partially offset by 2014 gains on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures.  
  Actuarial Assumption Review.   Our 2014 results include a $161 million ($105 million, net of income tax) benefit associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and DAC, of which $137 million ($89 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $161 million benefit, $82 million ($53 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $79 million ($52 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves.  
  The $137 million gain recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual assumption review was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives caption in the table above. 
  As a result of our annual assumption review, changes were made to economic, policyholder behavior, mortality and other assumptions. The most significant impacts were in the Retail Life and Annuity blocks of businesses and are summarized as follows:  
             
    Changes in economic assumptions resulted in a decrease in reserves, offset by unfavorable DAC, resulting in a net benefit of $229 million ($149 million, net of income tax). 
                
    Changes to policyholder behavior and mortality assumptions resulted in reserve increases, offset by favorable DAC, resulting in a net loss of $175 million ($114 million, net of income tax).  
                
    The remaining updates resulted in a decrease in reserves, coupled with favorable DAC, resulting in a benefit of $107 million ($70 million, net of income tax). The most notable update was related to our projection of closed block results.  
     Our 2013 results include a $101 million ($69 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and DAC, of which $138 million ($90 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $101 million charge, $228 million ($150 million, net of income tax) was related to reserves, offset by $127 million ($81 million, net of income tax) associated with DAC. The $138 million loss recorded in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual assumption review was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives caption in the table above. 
  Divested Businesses.     Income (loss) from continuing operations, before provision for income tax, related to the divested businesses, excluding net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), improved $156 million to a loss of $13 million in 2014 from a loss of $169 million in 2013. Included in this improvement was a decrease in total revenues of $142 million, before income tax, and a decrease in total expenses of $298 million, before income tax. The divested businesses include certain MetLife Bank businesses and MAL.

   Taxes.   Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.5 billion, or 28% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, compared with $661 million, or 16% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Company s 2014 and 2013 effective tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rate. The Company s 2013 effective tax rate also reflected tax benefits in Japan related to the 2012 branch restructuring and the estimated reversal of temporary differences. Our 2014 results include a $38 million tax charge related to a portion of the aforementioned settlement of a licensing matter, and the PPACA fee, both of which were not deductible for income tax purposes, as well as a $54 million tax charge related to tax reform in Chile and a $45 million tax charge related to the repatriation of earnings from Japan. These charges were partially offset by a $32 million one-time tax benefit related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return. In addition, in 2013, the Company received an income tax refund from the Japanese tax authority and recorded a $119 million reduction to income tax expense.  
  Operating Earnings.   Operating earnings available to common shareholders increased $299 million, net of income tax, to $6.6 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $6.3 billion, net of income tax, in 2013.

Year Ended December 31,   2015   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2014 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Overview.     The primary drivers of the decrease in operating earnings were lower investment yields, a tax charge and a related charge for interest on uncertain tax positions in 2015, less favorable underwriting results and an unfavorable impact from our annual review of actuarial assumptions, partially offset by higher net investment income from portfolio growth.    
    104 

     Table of Contents  

   Foreign Currency  .   Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a   $303 million   negative impact on operating earnings compared to 2014. 
  Business Growth.   We benefited from higher sales and business growth across many of our products. Growth in the investment portfolios of our domestic and Latin America segments generated higher net investment income, which was partially offset by higher surrenders of foreign currency-denominated fixed annuity products in Japan. The changes in business growth discussed above resulted in a   $474 million   increase in operating earnings. 
  Market Factors.     Market factors, including the sustained low interest rate environment, continued to impact our investment yields. Excluding the impact of inflation-indexed investments in the Latin America segment, investment yields decreased. Investment yields were negatively impacted by the adverse impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as well as by lower returns on other limited partnership interests and our securities lending program. These decreases were partially offset by higher income on currency and interest rate derivatives and higher returns on real estate and real estate joint ventures. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a     $545 million     decrease in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments.     A     $99 million     decrease in underwriting results was primarily due to higher non-catastrophe related claim costs, as well as higher catastrophe-related losses in our property   casualty businesses. On an annual basis, we review and update our long-term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance-related liabilities and DAC. These annual updates, which occurred in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of     $98 million     and were primarily related to unfavorable DAC unlockings in our Retail segment. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both 2015 and 2014 resulted in a net decrease of     $6 million     in operating earnings. The 2014 refinements include favorable reserve adjustments related to disability premium waivers and a charge related to delayed settlement interest on unclaimed funds held by state governments, all in our retail life business.    
  Expenses.   In 2015, other expenses include the aforementioned   $235 million   charge for interest on uncertain tax positions. An additional   $101 million   increase in expenses was primarily the result of higher employee-related costs and an increase in expenses associated with corporate initiatives and projects, primarily in Asia. These increases were partially offset by   a   $117 million   accrual in 2014 to increase the litigation reserve related to asbestos, as well as   2014 charges totaling   $57 million   related to the aforementioned settlement of a licensing matter.  
  Taxes.   The Company s 2015 and 2014 effective tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Our results for 2015 include the aforementioned tax charge of   $557 million   recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties, partially offset by a   $61 million   benefit in Japan related to a tax rate change, a one-time tax benefit of   $60 million   related to restructuring in Chile, a   $31 million   tax benefit related to the repatriation of earnings from Japan and a $  31 million   one-time tax benefit related to the devaluation of the peso in Argentina. In 2014, the Company realized a   $32 million   one-time tax benefit related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return. However, this was more than offset by a   $41 million   one-time tax charge related to tax reform in Chile and an   $18 million   tax charge related to the aforementioned settlement of a licensing matter which was not deductible for income tax purposes.

  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Overview.     The primary drivers of the increase in operating earnings were higher net investment income from portfolio growth, higher asset-based fee income and a decrease in interest credited expense, partially offset by unfavorable mortality, morbidity and claims experience and the impact of decreasing investment yields on net investment income. Excluding the impact of the aforementioned tax reform charge in Chile, the fourth quarter 2013 acquisition of ProVida increased operating earnings by $166 million.  
  Foreign Currency.   Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $127 million negative impact on results compared to 2013.

   Business Growth.   We benefited from strong sales and business growth across many of our products as evidenced by higher asset-based fee income from growth in our businesses abroad. However, we continue to focus on pricing discipline and risk management which resulted in a decrease in sales of our variable annuity products. This decline in sales, in combination with surrenders and withdrawals, resulted in negative net flows, which caused lower average separate account assets and, consequently, lower asset-based fee income in our Retail segment. Excluding the impact of the divested businesses and the acquisition of ProVida, growth in our investment portfolios in the majority of our segments generated higher net investment income. Our property   casualty businesses benefited from an increase in average premium per policy. These positive results were partially offset by an associated increase in DAC amortization. The changes in business growth discussed above resulted in a $432 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Market Factors.   Market factors, including the sustained low interest rate environment, continued to impact our investment yields, as well as our crediting rates. Excluding the results of the divested businesses, the acquisition of ProVida and the impact of inflation-indexed investments in the Latin America segment, investment yields decreased. Certain of our inflation-indexed products are backed by inflation-indexed investments. Changes in inflation cause fluctuations in net investment income with a corresponding fluctuation in policyholder benefits, resulting in a minimal impact to operating earnings. Investment yields were negatively impacted by the adverse impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans yields, lower returns on our hedge funds, as well as increased holdings of lower yielding Japanese government securities in the Japan fixed annuity business. These decreases were partially offset by higher returns on interest rate derivatives, real estate joint ventures and private equity investments. Yields were also favorably impacted by increased sales of foreign currency-denominated fixed annuities in Japan, resulting in an increase in higher yielding foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities. The sustained low interest rate environment also resulted in lower interest credited expense as we set interest credited rates lower on both new business and certain in-force business with rate resets that are contractually tied to external indices or contain discretionary rate reset provisions. Our average separate account balances grew with the equity markets driving higher fee income in our annuity business. However, this was partially offset by higher DAC amortization due to the significant prior period equity market increase, as well as higher asset-based commissions and costs associated with our variable annuity GMDBs. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $170 million decrease in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments.     Less favorable mortality and morbidity was driven by our Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits segment. In addition, in our property   casualty businesses, catastrophe-related losses increased due to severe storm activity in 2014. Non-catastrophe related claim costs also increased as a result of severe winter weather in 2014. Claims experience in our Latin America segment was also unfavorable. The combined impact of mortality, morbidity and claims experience decreased operating earnings by $146 million. The combined impact of the 2014 and 2013 annual assumption updates resulted in a $12 million decrease in operating earnings in 2014 as compared to 2013. In addition to our annual updates, refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both years increased operating earnings by $75 million. Such refinements include favorable reserve adjustments in 2014 related to disability premium waivers and a 2014 charge related to delayed settlement interest on unclaimed funds held by state governments, both in our life business within our Retail segment, as well as a write-down of DAC and VOBA in 2013 related to pension reform in Poland within our EMEA segment. Also, our 2013 results include a reserve strengthening in Australia within our Asia segment of $57 million, net of reinsurance. 
  Expenses.   A $112 million decrease in expenses was primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. In addition, our 2014 results include charges totaling $57 million related to the aforementioned settlement of a licensing matter with the Department of Financial Services and the District Attorney, New York County. The PPACA fee reduced operating earnings by $58 million in 2014. We increased our litigation reserves related to asbestos more in 2014 than in 2013 resulting in a $16 million decline in operating earnings.  
  Taxes.   In 2014, the Company realized a $32 million tax benefit related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return, as well as additional tax benefits of $36 million related to the separate account dividends received deduction and $58 million primarily related to foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the U.S. and other tax preference items. However, this was partially offset by a $38 million tax charge related to a portion of the aforementioned settlement of a licensing matter and the PPACA fee, both of which were not deductible for income tax purposes.

   Segment Results and Corporate   Other 
    Retail 
  Business Overview.   Retail annuity sales increased 15% as a result of new variable annuity products introduced in late 2014 and early 2015 and higher indexed annuity sales. Life sales increased 17% driven by increases in our term life products (due to pricing actions) and whole life products (as a result of several large cases, as well as a continued focus on our enhanced underwriting programs). A significant portion of our operating earnings is driven by separate account balances. Most directly, these balances determine asset-based fee income but they also impact DAC amortization and asset-based commissions. Separate account balances are driven by sales, movements in the market, surrenders, withdrawals, benefit payments, transfers and policy charges. Separate account balances have declined due to market performance along with the impact of negative net flows, as benefits, surrenders and withdrawals exceeded sales.

  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Business Growth  .   A $59 million increase in operating earnings was attributable to business growth. Our life businesses had positive net flows which resulted in higher net investment income. In addition, net investment income increased as a result of a larger invested asset base due to a higher amount of allocated equity as compared to 2014. This favorable impact was partially offset by a related increase in DAC amortization and an increase in interest credited expenses. Declines in broker-dealer revenue also decreased operating earnings. In our property   casualty business, an increase in average premium per policy in both the auto and homeowners businesses improved operating earnings, but was partially offset by a decrease in exposures. In our deferred annuities business, negative net flows decreased average separate account balances and, consequently, lower asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower DAC amortization due to the decrease in our in-force business.

     Table of Contents  

   Market Factors  .     A $177 million decrease in operating earnings was attributable to market factors, including equity markets and interest rates. The sustained low interest rate environment resulted in a decline in net investment income on our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans as proceeds from maturing investments were reinvested at lower yields. This reduction in 2015 income from lower yields was partially offset by a decrease in DAC amortization, as well as lower interest credited expense in our deferred annuities business as a result of declines in average interest credited rates. Lower returns on other limited partnership interests were partially offset by increased prepayment fees and higher returns on real estate and real estate joint ventures. While separate account fund returns were down slightly on a full year basis, the positive returns in the first half of the year drove an increase in our average separate account balances which resulted in a small increase in asset-based fee income, partially offset by higher DAC amortization. In addition, costs associated with our variable annuity GMDBs were lower in 2015.    
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments  .   Less favorable mortality in our universal life business, partially offset by favorable mortality in our traditional life and income annuities businesses resulted in a net decrease of $12 million in operating earnings. In our property   casualty business, non-catastrophe claim costs increased by $24 million as a result of higher severities in our auto and homeowners businesses and higher frequencies in our auto business, partially offset by lower frequencies in our homeowners business. Catastrophe-related losses increased $16 million mainly due to severe winter weather in 2015. Favorable morbidity experience in our individual disability income business resulted in a $5 million increase in operating earnings. On an annual basis, we review and update our long-term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance-related liabilities and DAC. These annual updates, which occurred in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $118 million and were primarily related to unfavorable DAC unlockings in the life businesses. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both 2015 and 2014 resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of $18 million, primarily driven by certain 2014 adjustments in our life business, as well as adjustments in our annuities business. The 2014 refinements include favorable reserve adjustments related to disability premium waivers and a charge related to delayed settlement interest on unclaimed funds held by state governments. 
  Expenses and Taxes  .   Operating earnings decreased due to an increase in expenses of $45 million, mainly the result of higher employee-related costs. In 2015, we realized lower tax benefits of $16 million primarily related to the separate account dividends received deduction. 
    Year Ended December 31,   2014   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2013 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Business Growth.   A $156 million increase in operating earnings was attributable to business growth. Our life businesses had positive net flows, despite a decline in universal life sales, which resulted in higher net investment income. This favorable impact was partially offset by increases in DAC amortization and interest credited expenses, as well as lower fees, as 2013 benefited from the first year fees received on the now discontinued lifetime secondary guarantees on our universal life products. In our deferred annuities business, the impact of negative net flows contributed to a decrease in asset-based fee income, partially offset by a reduction in interest credited expenses in the general account. Additionally, costs associated with our variable annuity GMDBs were lower. In our property   casualty business, an increase in average premium per policy in both our auto and homeowners businesses contributed to the increase in operating earnings. In addition, we earned more income on a larger invested asset base, which resulted from a higher amount of allocated equity as compared to 2013.  
  Market Factors.   A $58 million decrease in operating earnings was attributable to market factors, including equity markets and interest rates. Strong equity market performance led to higher asset-based commissions, which were, in part, driven by separate account balances, higher DAC amortization and costs associated with our GMDBs. The more favorable separate account returns in 2013 drove lower DAC amortization in 2013 as compared to 2014 where equity returns were much less favorable. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher asset-based fee income in 2014 due to increased average separate account balances. This positive equity market performance also drove higher net investment income from private equity investments. The sustained low interest rate environment resulted in a decline in net investment income on our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans as proceeds from maturing investments were reinvested at lower yields. This negative interest rate impact was partially offset by lower interest credited expense as we reduced interest credited rates on contracts with discretionary rate reset provisions, and lower DAC amortization in our life business. Lower returns in our hedge funds also decreased operating earnings and were partially offset by higher income from real estate joint ventures and increased prepayment fees.

   Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments.   Less favorable mortality experience in our variable and universal life business, primarily driven by three large, unreinsured claims, partially offset by favorable experience in the traditional life and immediate annuities businesses, resulted in a $40 million decrease in operating earnings. In our property   casualty business, non-catastrophe claim costs increased by $8 million as a result of higher frequencies in our auto business offset by lower frequencies in our homeowners business. Catastrophe-related losses increased $5 million as compared to 2013. In addition, favorable morbidity experience in our individual disability income business resulted in a $6 million increase in operating earnings. The combined impact of the 2014 and 2013 annual assumption updates resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $11 million and were primarily related to unfavorable DAC unlockings in the variable annuity business, partially offset by favorable DAC unlockings in our traditional and universal life businesses. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in 2014 and 2013 resulted in a $7 million increase in operating earnings, which included $104 million of favorable reserve adjustments in 2014 related to disability premium waivers and a 2014 charge of $57 million related to delayed settlement interest on unclaimed funds held by state governments, both in our life business.  
  Expenses and Taxes.   Operating earnings increased due to a decline in expenses of $109 million, mainly the result of lower employee-related costs and the 2013 increase in litigation reserves. In 2014, we realized additional tax benefits of $37 million related to the separate account dividends received deduction and $22 million related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return. 
    Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits  
  Business Overview.   Premiums increased for most of our businesses as a result of gradual growth in the U.S. economy, a decrease in the U.S. unemployment rate and low inflation. Our term life, dental, disability and voluntary benefits businesses generated premium growth due to sales and rate actions. In addition, we had strong persistency levels. The dental business also benefited from pricing actions on existing business. Our 2015 sales were slightly higher, as improved sales of voluntary products were largely offset by lower sales of our core group products as a result of increased competition. Although we have discontinued selling our long-term care product, we continue to collect premiums and administer the existing block of business, which contributed to asset growth in the segment.

     Table of Contents  

   Business Growth  .   A $73 million increase in operating earnings was attributable to business growth. An increase in average premium per policy in both our auto and homeowners businesses improved operating earnings. Growth in premiums, as well as increases in allocated equity resulted in higher average invested assets, improving operating earnings. Consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, primarily in our long-term care business, interest credited on long-duration contracts increased. An increase in the annual assessment of the PPACA fee increased other expenses in 2015; however, the impact of the assessment was significantly offset by a related increase in premiums from our dental business. The remaining increase in other operating expenses, mainly the result of growth across the segment, was more than offset by the remaining increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. 
  Market Factors  .   The sustained low interest rate environment drove lower investment yields on our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. In addition, yields were negatively impacted by a reduction in the size of our securities lending program, as well as lower returns on other limited partnership interests. This was partially offset by higher returns on alternative investments and currency derivatives. Unlike in the Retail and Corporate Benefit Funding segments, in the Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits segment, a change in investment yield does not necessarily drive a corresponding change in the rates credited on certain insurance liabilities. The decrease in investment yields was partially offset by the impact of lower crediting rates in 2015, which resulted in a net decrease in operating earnings of $14 million. 
  Underwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments  .   In our property   casualty business, catastrophe-related losses increased by $29 million, mainly due to severe winter weather in 2015. In addition, non-catastrophe claim costs increased $37 million, resulting from higher severities in both our auto and homeowners businesses, as well as higher frequencies in our auto business, partially offset by lower frequencies in our homeowners businesses. Further, less favorable development of prior year non-catastrophe losses resulted in a slight decrease to operating earnings. Our life and AD D businesses experienced favorable mortality in 2015, mainly due to favorable claims experience, which resulted in a $46 million increase in operating earnings. Less favorable reserve development in our dental business was partially offset by favorable morbidity experience in our long-term care and disability businesses and resulted in a $16 million decrease in operating earnings. The favorable claims experience in our long-term care business was due to higher net closures and the impact of lapses on certain insurance liabilities. In our disability business, the favorable claims experience was primarily driven by fewer approvals, a reduction in the average size of claims and higher net closures. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in a $17 million increase in operating earnings.

  Business Growth.   The increase in average premium per policy in both our auto and homeowners businesses improved operating earnings by $42 million. Growth in premiums and deposits in 2014, as well as an increase in allocated equity, partially offset by reductions in other liabilities and policyholder account balances, resulted in an increase in our average invested assets, increasing operating earnings by $51 million. Consistent with the growth in average invested assets from premiums and deposits, primarily in our long-term care business, interest credited on long-duration contracts and policyholder account balances increased by $24 million. The PPACA fee increased other expenses by $58 million in 2014; however, the impact of the assessment was significantly offset by a related increase in premiums in the dental business. The remaining increase in other operating expenses, including higher marketing and sales support costs in our property   casualty business, was partially offset by the remaining increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. 
  Market Factors.   The impact of changes in market factors, including lower yields on our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, and decreased income on alternative investments, partially offset by higher returns on our real estate joint ventures and private equity investments, resulted in lower investment yields. The decrease in investment yields, slightly offset by lower crediting rates in 2014, reduced operating earnings by $29 million.

   Underwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments.   Our life business experienced less favorable mortality in 2014, mainly due to an increase in claims severity in the term life business and increased claims incidence in the group universal life business, which resulted in a $48 million decrease in operating earnings. Unfavorable claims experience in our disability business, driven by higher approvals, was partially offset by higher net closures. In addition, increased utilization of services across the channels of our dental business was partially offset by the impact of lapses on certain insurance liabilities, higher net closures in our long-term care business and favorable claims incidence in our AD D business. Our overall net unfavorable claims experience resulted in a $14 million decrease in operating earnings. The impact of favorable refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities in 2014 resulted in an increase in operating earnings of $27 million. In our property   casualty business, catastrophe-related losses increased by $21 million as compared to 2013, mainly due to severe storm activity in 2014. In addition, severe winter weather in 2014 increased non-catastrophe claim costs by $18 million, which was the result of higher frequencies in both our auto and homeowners businesses, as well as higher severities in our homeowners business, partially offset by lower severities in our auto business. These unfavorable results were partially offset by additional favorable development of prior year non-catastrophe losses, which improved operating earnings by $15 million. 
    Corporate Benefit Funding 
  Business Overview.   Funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S P 500 companies continued to fall in 2015, limiting their ability to engage in full pension plan buyouts. However, we expect that customers may choose to close out portions of pension plans over time, with the largest volume of business generally occurring near the end of any year. Despite the decline in funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S P 500 companies, higher pension risk transfers resulted in an increase in premiums. In addition, more competitive pricing in the market drove a decrease in structured settlement annuity sales. Changes in premiums for these businesses were almost entirely offset by the related changes in policyholder benefits and claims.

  Business Growth  .   The impact of 2015 deposits and funding agreement issuances resulted in higher invested assets, which drove an increase in net investment income, partially offset by the related increase in interest credited expense, and resulted in a $106 million increase in operating earnings. Net funding agreement issuances were higher in 2014 to take advantage of favorable market conditions in advance of scheduled contract maturities.

   Market Factors  .   The sustained low interest rate environment drove lower investment yields on mortgage loans and fixed maturity securities, as well as from our securities lending program. In addition, weaker equity markets in 2015 resulted in lower returns on other limited partnership interests. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by higher income on interest rate and currency derivatives, real estate and real estate joint ventures, as well as the favorable impact of a conversion of the securities accounting system. An increase in interest credited expense, resulting from a higher average rate, was driven by the effect of divesting a lower yielding product in early 2014. The combined impact of lower investment returns and higher interest credited expense, resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of $144 million. 
  Underwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments  .   Less favorable mortality in our pension risk transfer and structured settlement businesses was partially offset by more favorable mortality from our income annuity and specialized life insurance products, and resulted in a $6 million decrease in operating earnings. The net impact of insurance liability refinements that were recorded in both 2015 and 2014 decreased operating earnings by $20 million. 
  Expenses  .   Slightly higher employee-related costs and annual premium tax adjustments were partially offset by lower non-deferrable commissions, driven by a decrease in structured settlement annuity sales in 2015, and decreased operating earnings by $4 million.

  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Business Growth.   The impact of 2014 deposits and funding agreement issuances, as well as increases in allocated equity and other liabilities, resulted in higher invested assets, which drove an increase in net investment income that was partially offset by the related increase in interest credited expense and resulted in a $122 million increase in operating earnings. In addition, strong investment performance and large case sales for our separate account products drove higher average account balances which resulted in an increase in separate account fees of $8 million.  
  Market Factors.   The sustained low interest rate environment impacted our interest credited rates, as well as our investment yields. Many of our funding agreements and guaranteed interest contract liabilities have interest credited rates that are contractually tied to external indices and, as a result, we set lower interest credited rates on new business, as well as on existing business with terms that can fluctuate. The sustained low interest rate environment drove lower investment yields on mortgage loans and fixed maturity securities. In addition, hedge fund income declined. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by the impact of changes in market factors that drove higher income on interest rate derivatives and improved returns on real estate joint ventures. The impact of lower interest credited expense offset by lower investment returns resulted in an increase in operating earnings of $34 million. 
  Underwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments.   Favorable mortality in 2014, primarily in our structured settlements business, resulted in a $24 million increase in operating earnings. The net impact of insurance liability refinements that were recorded in 2014 and 2013 increased operating earnings by $28 million. 
  Taxes.   In 2014, we realized additional tax benefits of $11 million primarily related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax return.

  Business Overview.   Total sales for the region decreased primarily due to the impact of a large contract in Mexico in 2014. Excluding this contract, sales for the region increased due to organic growth in several countries.   Total sales of life, accident   health and credit products increased across several countries. Life and accident   health product sales also increased in our U.S. direct business. Sales of retirement products were down as lower sales in Mexico were only partially offset by higher sales in Brazil.

  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Foreign Currency  .     The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased operating earnings by $111 million for 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to the weakening of the peso against the U.S. dollar, which included the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the one-time tax charge resulting from tax reform in Chile, as discussed further below. 
  Business Growth  .   Total sales for the region decreased primarily due to the impact of a large contract in Mexico in 2014. Excluding this large contract, sales increased due to organic growth in several countries, as well as in our U.S. direct business but the resulting increase in premiums was partially offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. An increase in average invested assets, primarily in Chile and Mexico, generated higher net investment income. Growth in our businesses resulted in higher policy fee income, as well as increased marketing costs and commissions, which were partially offset by increased DAC capitalization. The items discussed above were the primary drivers of a $133 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Market Factors  .   The net impact of changes in market factors resulted in an $83 million decrease in operating earnings, driven by lower investment yields and higher interest credited expense. Investment yields decreased on fixed income securities in Chile and Mexico and we experienced lower investment returns on alternative investments in Chile. 
  Underwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments  .     Unfavorable claims experience in several countries decreased operating earnings by $16 million. Refinements to DAC and other adjustments recorded in both 2015 and 2014 resulted in a $14 million increase in operating earnings.

   Expenses and Taxes  .   Effective September 1, 2015, ProVida was merged into MetLife Chile Acquisition Company resulting in a one-time income tax benefit of $60 million in 2015. In the third quarter of 2014, our Chilean businesses, including ProVida, incurred a one-time tax charge of $41 million ($33 million after adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations) as a result of tax reform in Chile. Other tax-related adjustments in both 2015 and 2014 decreased operating earnings by $18 million. These tax-related adjustments include tax charges related to inflation in Chile and Mexico, as well as a 2014 refund claim in Argentina, partially offset by a benefit resulting from the devaluation of the peso in Argentina in both 2015 and 2014. In addition, employee-related costs, which include inflation, were higher across several countries, resulting in an $8 million decrease in operating earnings.    
    Year Ended December 31,   2014   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2013 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  A tax reform bill was enacted in Chile on September 29, 2014 which includes, among other things, a gradual increase in the corporate tax rate. Our Chilean businesses, including ProVida, incurred a one-time tax charge of $41 million as a result of this legislation. Excluding the aforementioned tax reform, our operating earnings increased by $166 million in 2014 due to the fourth quarter 2013 acquisition of ProVida. 
  Foreign Currency.   The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased operating earnings by $57 million compared to 2013. 
  Business Growth.   Latin America experienced organic growth and increased sales of life products in several countries, as well as in our U.S. sponsored direct business. This was partially offset by decreased pension and accident   health sales in Mexico and Brazil. The resulting increase in premiums was partially offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. Growth in our businesses and the impact of inflation drove an increase in average invested assets, which generated higher net investment income and higher policy fee income, partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited on certain insurance liabilities and the impact of changes in allocated equity. Increases in marketing costs and commissions resulted in higher operating expenses. Business growth also drove an increase in DAC amortization. The items discussed above were the primary drivers of a $94 million increase in operating earnings. 
  Market Factors.   The net impact of changes in market factors resulted in a $25 million decrease in operating earnings. This decrease was primarily driven by higher interest credited expense, the unfavorable impact of inflation, and lower yields from alternative investments and mortgage loans in Chile, partially offset by higher investment yields on fixed income securities in Chile and Brazil. 
  Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments.   Unfavorable claims experience, primarily due to increased claims severity and frequency in Mexico, Chile and Brazil, decreased operating earnings by $32 million. The impact of the 2013 annual assumption review resulted in an operating earnings decrease of $7 million. In addition to our annual updates, other refinements to DAC and other adjustments recorded in both 2014 and 2013 resulted in a $13 million decrease in operating earnings. 
  Expenses and Taxes.   Tax-related adjustments in both 2014 and 2013 increased operating earnings by $45 million, excluding the aforementioned tax reform. These tax-related adjustments include 2014 tax benefits related to the devaluation of the peso in Argentina, inflation in Argentina and Chile, and a 2013 tax rate change in Mexico. These increases were partially offset by higher expenses, primarily generated by employee- and information technology-related costs across several countries, which decreased operating earnings by $23 million.

  Business Overview.     S  ales decreased slightly compared to 2014 due to lower group sales in Australia. This was partially offset by growth in our ordinary life and accident   health businesses in Japan. 

Year Ended December 31,   2015   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2014 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Foreign Currency  . The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced operating earnings by $126 million for 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the weakening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. This resulted in significant variances in the financial statement line items. 
  Business Growth  . Asia s premiums, fees and other revenues increased over the prior year driven by broad based in-force growth across the region, including growth in our ordinary life and accident   health businesses in Japan and Korea, as well as our group insurance business in Australia. Changes in premiums for these businesses were partially offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. During the period, surrenders of foreign currency-denominated fixed annuity products in Japan also contributed to higher fee income. The impact of these surrenders, partially offset by positive net flows in Korea, Bangladesh and India, resulted in lower average invested assets and a decrease in net investment income. In addition, a decrease in interest credited expenses was partially offset by increases in amortization of DAC and VOBA, commissions and variable expenses (net of DAC capitalization), primarily related to the establishment of an agency channel in Hong Kong. The combined impact of the items discussed above improved operating earnings by $61 million. 
  Market Factors  . Investment returns were positively impacted by higher net investment income resulting from the recovery of a previously impaired mortgage loan in Japan, improved operating results from our China joint venture and higher interest rates on fixed maturity securities in Bangladesh. These improved investment returns were partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on fixed maturity securities in Korea and the impact in Japan of continued growth of lower yielding Japanese government securities. The decrease in returns from Japanese government securities was offset by the favorable impact of increased foreign currency-denominated fixed annuities in Japan driving an increase in higher yielding foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities.   Higher investment yields, combined with the impact of foreign currency hedges, increased operating earnings by $38 million. 
  Underwriting and Actuarial Assumption Review  .   Favorable claims experience, primarily in Japan resulted in a $15 million increase in operating earnings. In addition, on an annual basis, we review and update our long-term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance-related liabilities and DAC. This annual update resulted in a net operating earnings increase of $22 million.

   Expenses and Taxes  .   Higher expenses, primarily driven by costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects, reduced operating earnings by $32 million. Our 2015 results include one-time tax benefits of $61 million related to a change in tax rates, $12 million for the settlement of an audit and $15 million related to the U.S. taxation of dividends, each related to Japan. In addition, in 2015, Korea received a tax refund of $6 million related to unclaimed surrender value. Our 2014 results include one-time tax benefits of $9 million related to the U.S. taxation of dividends and $4 million resulting from a tax rate change, each related to Japan. 
    Year Ended December 31,   2014   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2013    
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Foreign Currency.   The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced operating earnings by $52 million for 2014 as compared with 2013 and resulted in significant variances in the financial statement line items. For example, while premiums, fees and other revenues decreased 3% on a reported basis, they increased 3% on a constant currency basis. 
  Business Growth.   Asia s premiums, fees and other revenues increased over 2013 primarily driven by broad based in-force growth across the region, including in our ordinary life business in Japan and our group insurance business in Australia. Positive net flows in Korea and Japan, combined with growth in our life business in India and Bangladesh, resulted in higher average invested assets and generated an increase in net investment income. Changes in premiums for these businesses were offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. The combined impact of the items discussed above improved operating earnings by $90 million. 
  Market Factors.   Investment returns were negatively affected by the adverse impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on mortgage loans and an increase in lower yielding Japanese government securities, combined with lower returns on our other limited partnership interests and decreased prepayment fee income. These declines in yields were partially offset by the favorable impact of increased sales of foreign currency-denominated fixed annuities resulting in an increase in higher yielding foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities in Japan. Declines in yields, combined with the impact of foreign currency hedges, resulted in a $46 million decrease in operating earnings. 
  Underwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments.   Our 2013 results include a strengthening of group and permanent disability claim reserves of $57 million, net of reinsurance, in Australia. In addition, refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in 2014 and 2013 resulted in a $14 million increase in operating earnings. Our 2014 results for Korea decreased $5 million as a result of unfavorable claims experience, primarily in our life business, and regulatory changes.  
  Taxes.   Our 2014 results include a $9 million tax benefit related to U.S. taxation of dividends from Japan and a $4 million tax benefit resulting from a tax rate change in Japan. Our 2013 results include a $17 million tax benefit in Japan related to the estimated reversal of temporary differences and a one-time tax benefit of $10 million related to the disposal of our interest in a Korean asset management company at the beginning of 2013.

   EMEA 
  Business Overview.   Sales have increased slightly as 2015 sales growth in Turkey, Italy and Poland was offset by strong 2014 sales in the Gulf.  

Year Ended December 31,   2015   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2014 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Foreign Currency  .     The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced operating earnings by $66 million for 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Russian ruble and Polish zloty. 
  Business Growth  .   Operating earnings benefited from growth in the Middle East, primarily in the Gulf and Turkey, as well as growth in the U.K., increasing operating earnings by $30 million. 
  Actuarial Assumption Review.   On an annual basis, we review and update our long-term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance-related liabilities and DAC. These annual updates, which occurred in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $4 million. In addition, operating earnings increased by $5 million due to a 2014 refinement of DAC in the U.K. 
  Taxes and Other.   The Company had a number of one-time items in both 2015 and 2014, including tax benefits, the conversion of certain of our subsidiaries to calendar year reporting, as well as re-branding and legal expenses. The combined impact of these items decreased operating earnings by $3 million. In addition, our 2014 results included a $7 million one-time benefit related to pension reform in Poland.

   Business Growth.   An increase in sales over 2013, primarily in the Middle East and central, eastern and southern Europe, was partially offset by the impact of regulatory changes in the U.K. Net investment income increased, driven by an increase in average invested assets from business growth in Egypt, the Persian Gulf and Russia, in addition to a slight increase in yields from the lengthening of the Ireland and Greece shorter-term portfolios into higher yielding longer duration fixed maturity securities. This was partially offset by the impact of changes in allocated equity. Our 2014 results also included certain legal and re-branding expenses, as well as higher corporate overhead expenses, while operating earnings benefited as a result of a review of certain tax liabilities. The combined impact of the items discussed above decreased operating earnings by $16 million. 
  Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments.   The combined impact of the 2014 and 2013 annual assumption updates resulted in a net operating earnings increase of $6 million for 2014 as compared to 2013. The amortization, or release, of negative VOBA associated with the conversion of certain policies generally results in an increase in operating earnings. In 2014, the number of policies converted declined and so, relative to 2013, this reduced operating earnings by $11 million. A refinement in DAC in the U.K. resulted in a $5 million decrease to operating earnings and liability refinements in 2013 in Greece decreased operating earnings by $4 million.  
  Taxes and Other.   Our 2013 results were negatively impacted as a result of a $30 million tax charge related to the write-off of a U.K. tax loss carryforward and by a $26 million write-down of DAC and VOBA related to pension reform in Poland. The Company received tax benefits in both years following its decision to permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings outside of the U.S., however, since the 2013 benefit was larger, operating earnings decreased by $18 million. In addition, our 2013 results benefited by $4 million due to a change in the local corporate tax rate in Greece. In 2014, we converted to calendar year reporting for certain of our subsidiaries, which resulted in a $17 million increase to operating earnings.

   The table below presents operating earnings available to common shareholders by source net of income tax: 

Year Ended December 31,   2015   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2014 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Other Business Activities.     Operating earnings from other business activities decreased $41 million. This was primarily due to lower operating earnings from start-up operations and from the assumed reinsurance from our former operating joint venture in Japan, reflecting lower fund returns, a reduction in in-force due to surrenders and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. 
  Other Net Investment Income.   A $122 million decrease in other net investment income was driven by an increase in the amount credited to the segments due to growth in the economic capital managed by Corporate   Other on their behalf. This decrease   was also impacted by   the sustained low interest rate environment, which drove lower investment yields on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as well as lower returns on alternative investments. This was partially offset by increased income from higher average invested assets and improved returns on real estate investments. 
  Interest Expense on Debt.   Interest expense on debt increased by $20 million, mainly due to the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior notes in March 2015 and $1.25 billion of senior notes in November 2015. 
  Corporate Initiatives and Projects.     Expenses associated with corporate initiatives and projects increased by $11 million, primarily due to increased costs associated with enterprise-wide initiatives taken by the Company. 
  Incremental Tax Benefit (Expense).     Corporate   Other benefits from the impact of certain permanent tax differences, including non-taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. As a result, our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. Our 2015 results include the aforementioned tax charge of $557 million, which was recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. Our 2014 results include an $18 million tax charge related to a portion of the settlement of a licensing matter that was not deductible for income tax purposes. In addition, in 2015, we had higher utilization of tax preferenced investments, a benefit related to the timing of certain tax credits and other tax benefits which increased our operating earnings by $68 million over 2014.    
  Other.     Our 2015 results include the aforementioned charge of $235 million for interest on uncertain tax positions, as well as a $20 million charge associated with company use real estate. These increases in expenses were partially offset by a $21 million one-time tax refund received for a favorable outcome on prior year tax audits and a decrease in employee-related costs of $28 million from 2014. Our results for 2014 include a $117 million accrual to increase the litigation reserve related to asbestos and charges totaling $57 million related to the settlement of a licensing matter with the Department of Financial Services and the District Attorney, New York County. This was partially offset by an $18 million increase in operating earnings in 2014 resulting from net adjustments to certain reinsurance assets and liabilities. 
    Year Ended December 31,   2014   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2013 
  Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
  Other Business Activities.   Operating earnings from other business activities decreased by $22 million. Lower operating earnings from the assumed reinsurance from our former operating joint venture in Japan, primarily due to lower returns in 2014, were partially offset by higher operating earnings from start-up operations.

     Table of Contents  

   Other Net Investment Income.   Other net investment income decreased by $148 million. This decrease was driven by an increase in the amount credited to the segments on economic capital managed by Corporate   Other on their behalf, the adverse impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on yields from our fixed maturity securities and lower returns on real estate investments. These decreases were partially offset by improved returns on other limited partnership interests and higher mark-to-market income on residential mortgage loans carried at fair value. 
  Interest Expense on Debt.   Interest expense on debt increased by $12 million, mainly due to the issuance of $1.0 billion of senior notes in April 2014 and the recognition of issuance costs related to the early redemption of senior notes in May 2014. 
  Acquisition Costs.   Acquisition costs decreased by $13 million due to lower internal resource costs for associates committed to certain acquisition activities. 
  Corporate Initiatives and Projects.   Expenses related to corporate initiatives and projects increased by $49 million, primarily due to higher relocation costs, severance and consulting expenses. These expenses include a $16 million decrease in restructuring charges, the majority of which related to severance. 
  Incremental Tax Benefit.   The tax benefit in 2014 included a tax benefit of $16 million related to the timing of certain tax credits. In addition, we incurred a tax charge of $6 million in 2014 and received a tax benefit of $10 million in 2013 related to the filing of the Company s U.S. federal tax returns. Our results for 2014 also included an $18 million tax charge related to a portion of the aforementioned settlement of a licensing matter that was not deductible for income tax purposes.  
  Other.   Our results for 2014 include charges totaling $57 million related to the settlement of a licensing matter with the Department of Financial Services and the District Attorney, New York County. In addition, we increased our litigation reserves related to asbestos more in 2014 than in 2013 resulting in a $16 million decline in operating earnings. This was partially offset by a $53 million decline in expenses which included decreases in interest on uncertain tax positions, lower corporate overhead expenses and an adjustment on certain reinsurance assets and liabilities. In addition, declines in employee-related costs and lower software amortization totaling $15 million, improved operating earnings. 
    Effects of Inflation 
  Management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates. 
  An increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. Inflation could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss adjustment expenses in certain of our businesses, which could require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for future inflation. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.

   Investments 
    Investment Risks 
  Our primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The Investments Department, led by the Chief Investment Officer, manages investment risks using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures and limits, as discussed further below. The Investments Risk Committee, chaired by GRM, reviews and monitors investment risk limits and tolerances. We are exposed to the following primary sources of investment risks: 
             
    credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest; 
                
    interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in market interest rates will impact the net unrealized gain or loss position of our fixed income investment portfolio and the rates of return we receive on both new funds invested and reinvestment of existing funds; 
                
    liquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments, in times of strained market conditions; 
                
    market valuation risk, relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit-based non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and, if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely result in higher OTTI. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed maturity securities and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio; 
                
    currency risk, relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments. This risk relates to potential decreases in estimated fair value and net investment income resulting from changes in currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments; and 
                
    real estate risk, relating to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate, and stemming from factors, which include, but are not limited to, market conditions, including the demand and supply of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of tenants and partners, capital markets volatility and the inherent interest rate movement. 
     We manage investment risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. We also manage credit risk, market valuation risk and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. Risk limits to promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single issuer and limit overall aggregate credit exposure as measured by our economic capital framework are approved annually by a committee of directors that oversees our investment portfolio. For real estate assets, we manage credit risk and market valuation risk through geographic, property type and product type diversification and asset allocation. We manage interest rate risk as part of our ALM strategies. These strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile, and utilizing product design, such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, to manage interest rate risk. We also manage interest rate risk through proactive monitoring and management of certain non-guaranteed elements of our products, such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. In addition to hedging with foreign currency derivatives, we manage currency risk by matching much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. We also use certain derivatives in the management of credit, interest rate, and equity market risks. 
  We use purchased credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk in our investment portfolio. Generally, we purchase credit protection by entering into credit default swaps referencing the issuers of specific assets we own. In certain cases, basis risk exists between these credit default swaps and the specific assets we own. For example, we may purchase credit protection on a macro basis to reduce exposure to specific industries or other portfolio concentrations. In such instances, the referenced entities and obligations under the credit default swaps may not be identical to the individual obligors or securities in our investment portfolio. In addition, our purchased credit default swaps may have shorter tenors than the underlying investments they are hedging. However, we dynamically hedge this risk through the rebalancing and rollover of our credit default swaps at their most liquid tenors. We believe that our purchased credit default swaps serve as effective economic hedges of our credit exposure. 
    121 

     Table of Contents  

   We generally enter into market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. Payout under such contracts is triggered by certain credit events experienced by the referenced entities. For credit default swaps covering North American corporate issuers, credit events typically include bankruptcy and failure to pay on borrowed money. For European corporate issuers, credit events typically also include involuntary restructuring. With respect to credit default contracts on Western European sovereign debt, credit events typically include failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, or involuntary restructuring. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association deems that a credit event has occurred. 
    Current Environment 
  The global economy and markets continue to be affected by stress and volatility, which has adversely affected the financial services sector, in particular, and global capital markets. Recently, weakness in the energy and metals and mining sectors and political and/or economic instability of countries and regions outside the EU, including China, Ukraine, Russia, Argentina, Brazil, Japan, the Middle East and Puerto Rico, as well as Europe s perimeter region and Cyprus, have contributed to global market volatility. As a global insurance company, we are affected by the monetary policy of central banks around the world. See    Industry Trends   Financial and Economic Environment  for information on actions taken by the ECB and Bank of Japan in recent years to support economic recovery. See also    Industry Trends   Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment  for information regarding the December 2015 action taken by the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate and its January 2016 determination to maintain it. The Federal Reserve may take further actions to influence interest rates in the future, which may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may adversely impact the level of product sales. 
    European Region Investments 
  Excluding Europe s perimeter region and Cyprus which are discussed below, our holdings of sovereign debt, corporate debt and perpetual hybrid securities in certain EU member states and other countries in the region that are not members of the EU (collectively, the  European Region ) were concentrated in the U.K., Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Norway and Sweden. The sovereign debt of these countries continues to maintain investment grade credit ratings from all major rating agencies. We maintain general account investments in the European Region to support our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities in these countries and certain of our non-European Region operations invest in the region for diversification. In the European Region, we have proactively mitigated risk in both direct and indirect exposures by investing in a diversified portfolio of high quality investments with a focus on the higher-rated countries. Sovereign debt issued by countries outside of Europe s perimeter region and Cyprus comprised $6.8 billion, or 98%, of our European Region sovereign fixed maturity securities, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2015. The European Region corporate securities (fixed maturity and perpetual hybrid securities classified as non-redeemable preferred stock) are invested in a diversified portfolio of primarily non-financial services securities, which comprised $20.8 billion, or 70%, of European Region total corporate securities, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2015. Of these European Region sovereign fixed maturity and corporate securities, 92% were investment grade and, for the 8% that were below investment grade, the majority were non-financial services corporate securities at December 31, 2015. European Region financial services corporate securities, at estimated fair value, were $9.0 billion (including $6.4 billion within the banking sector) with 95% invested in investment grade rated corporate securities, at December 31, 2015. 
    Selected Country and Sector Investments 
  In recent years, elevated levels of market volatility have affected the performance of various asset classes. Contributing factors include concerns about global economic conditions and capital markets; lower oil prices impacting the energy sector; lower commodity prices impacting the metals and mining sector; country specific volatility due to local economic and/or political concerns, including concerns over the solvency of the EU member states included in Europe s perimeter region and Cyprus, their banking systems and the financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by these countries or their respective banking systems. While economic conditions in certain of these countries, including Europe s perimeter region, seem to be stabilizing or improving, greater ECB and International Monetary Fund support, stronger liquidity facilities and gradually improving macroeconomic conditions at the country level have reduced the risk of default on sovereign debt and/or the risk of possible withdrawal of such countries from the Euro zone. See    Industry Trends   Financial and Economic Environment.

     Table of Contents  

   The following table presents, by country, a summary of fixed maturity securities in selected countries. We maintain general account investments in the selected countries to support our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities in these countries or we have exposure through our global portfolio diversification. The Company has written credit default swaps where the underlying is an index comprised of companies across various sectors in the European Region. At December 31,   2015  , the written credit default swaps exposure to Europe s perimeter region and Cyprus was   $209 million   in notional amount and   $2 million   in estimated fair value. The information below is presented on a country of risk basis (e.g. the country where the issuer primarily conducts business).

            (2) 
    Our exposure to Puerto Rico sovereigns is in the form of political subdivision fixed maturities and is composed completely of revenue bonds. We have no Puerto Rico general obligation bonds. 
     There has been an increased focus on energy sector investments and metals and mining sector investments as a result of lower energy, oil and commodity prices. Our net exposure to energy sector fixed maturity securities was   $12.0 billion   (comprised of fixed maturity securities of   $11.9 billion   at estimated fair value and related net written credit default swaps of   $60 million   at notional value), of which   86%   were investment grade, with unrealized losses of   $222 million   at December 31,   2015  . Our net exposure to metals and mining sector fixed maturity securities was   $2.1 billion   (comprised of fixed maturity securities of   $2.1 billion   at estimated fair value and related net written credit default swaps of   $13 million   at notional value), of which   82%   were investment grade, with unrealized losses of   $206 million   at December 31,   2015  . 
  We manage direct and indirect investment exposure in the selected countries, the energy sector and the metals and mining sector through fundamental credit analysis and we continually monitor and adjust our level of investment exposure. We do not expect that our general account investments in these countries, the energy sector or the metals and mining sector will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

   Current Environment Summary 
  All of these factors have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results of companies in the financial services industry, including MetLife. Such global economic conditions, as well as the global financial markets, continue to impact our net investment income, net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), level of unrealized gains (losses) within the various asset classes in our investment portfolio, and our level of investment in lower yielding cash equivalents, short-term investments and government securities. See    Industry Trends  and  Risk Factors   Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks   We Are Exposed to Significant Global Financial and Capital Markets Risks Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and May Cause Our Net Investment Income to Vary from Period to Period.  
    Investment Portfolio Results 
  The following yield table presents the yield and investment income (loss) for our investment portfolio for the periods indicated. As described in the footnotes below, this table reflects certain differences from the presentation of net investment income presented in the GAAP consolidated statements of operations. This yield table presentation is consistent with how we measure our investment performance for management purposes, and we believe it enhances understanding of our investment portfolio results. 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Yields are calculated as investment income as a percent of average quarterly asset carrying values. Investment income excludes recognized gains and losses and reflects GAAP adjustments presented in footnote (5) below. Asset carrying values exclude unrealized gains (losses), collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, freestanding derivative assets, collateral received from derivative counterparties, the effects of consolidating certain variable interest entities ( VIEs ) under GAAP that are treated as consolidated securitization entities ( CSEs ) and contractholder-directed unit-linked investments. A yield is not presented for other invested assets as it is not considered a meaningful measure of performance for this asset class. 
               (3) 
    Investment income from fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans includes prepayment fees.

    Yield calculations include the net investment income and ending carrying values of the divested businesses. The net investment income adjustment for divested businesses for the years ended December 31,   2014   and   2013   was   $72 million   and   $197 million  , respectively. Net investment income included in yield calculations include earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting ( investment hedge adjustments ). Investment hedge adjustments are a reclassification adjustment to net investment income presented in the yield table to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as presented below. The investment hedge adjustments presented below exclude cash settlements of   $1 million   and   $10 million   for the years ended December 31,   2014  , and   2013  , respectively. There were no net investment income adjustments for divested businesses or excluded scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivatives for the year ended December 31,   2015  . 
              (5) 
    Net investment income presented in the yield table varies from the most directly comparable GAAP measure due to certain reclassifications and adjustments and excludes the effects of consolidating certain VIEs under GAAP that are treated as CSEs and contractholder-directed unit-linked investments. Such reclassifications and adjustments are presented in the table below.

Upon acquisition, we classify perpetual securities that have attributes of both debt and equity as fixed maturity securities if the securities have an interest rate step-up feature which, when combined with other qualitative factors, indicates that the securities have more debt-like characteristics; while those with more equity-like characteristics are classified as equity securities. Many of such securities, commonly referred to as  perpetual hybrid securities,  have been issued by non-U.S. financial institutions that are accorded the highest two capital treatment categories by their respective regulatory bodies (i.e. core capital, or  Tier 1 capital  and perpetual deferrable securities, or  Upper Tier 2 capital ). 
  Redeemable preferred stock with a stated maturity is included within fixed maturity securities. These securities, which are commonly referred to as  capital securities,  primarily have cumulative interest deferral features and are primarily issued by U.S. financial institutions. 
  In connection with our investment management business, we manage privately-placed and infrastructure fixed maturity securities on behalf of institutional clients, which are unaffiliated investors. These privately-placed and infrastructure fixed maturity securities had an estimated fair value of   $6.1 billion   and   $4.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. These assets are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 
  Also in connection with our investment management business, we manage index investment portfolios that track the return of standard industry fixed income and equity market indices such as the Barclay s U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and S P 500        Index. These assets had an estimated fair value of   $26.0 billion   and   $27.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, and are included within separate account assets in our consolidated financial statements.

   Valuation of Securities.   We are responsible for the determination of the estimated fair value of our investments. We determine the estimated fair value of publicly-traded securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: quoted market prices in active markets, independent pricing services, or independent broker quotations. We determine the estimated fair value of privately-placed securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: market standard internal matrix pricing, market standard internal discounted cash flow techniques, or independent pricing services (after we determine the independent pricing services  use of available observable market data). For publicly-traded securities, the number of quotations obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument. Generally, we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities, but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy. Independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on data about market transactions and inputs from multiple pricing sources that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. See Note     10     of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the types of market standard valuation methodologies utilized and key assumptions and observable inputs used in applying these standard valuation methodologies. When a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service, management values the security primarily using market standard internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques, and non-binding quotations from independent brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities. Independent non-binding broker quotations utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market data. As shown in the following section, less than     1%     of our fixed maturity securities were valued using non-binding quotations from independent brokers at December 31,     2015  . 
  Senior management, independent of the trading and investing functions, is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies, including reviewing and approving new transaction types and markets, for ensuring that observable market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation, wherever possible, and for determining that valuation adjustments, when applied, are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time. See Note   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our valuation controls and procedures including our formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value. 
  We have reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of our securities. Based on the results of this review and investment class analysis, each instrument is categorized as Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the lowest level significant input to its valuation. See Note   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs by level within the three level fair value hierarchy by major classes of invested assets. 
    Fair Value of Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities   AFS  
  Fixed maturity and equity securities AFS measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value pricing sources are as follows:

   The composition of fair value pricing sources for and significant changes in Level 3 securities at December 31,   2015   are as follows: 
             
    The majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity and equity securities AFS were concentrated in four sectors: U.S. and foreign corporate securities, residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), and asset-backed securities ( ABS ). 
                
    Level 3 fixed maturity securities are priced principally through market standard valuation methodologies, independent pricing services and, to a much lesser extent, independent non-binding broker quotations using inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 fixed maturity securities consist of less liquid securities with very limited trading activity or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation methodologies. Level 3 fixed maturity securities include: sub-prime RMBS; certain below investment grade private securities and less liquid investment grade corporate securities (included in U.S. and foreign corporate securities); less liquid ABS and foreign government securities. 
                
    During the year ended December 31,   2015  , Level 3 fixed maturity securities decreased by   $1.3 billion  , or   6%  . The decrease was driven by net transfers out of Level 3, partially offset by purchases in excess of sales and a decrease in estimated fair value recognized in OCI. 
     See Note   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for fixed maturity securities and equity securities AFS measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs; transfers into and/or out of Level 3; and further information about the valuation techniques and inputs by level by major classes of invested assets that affect the amounts reported above.

    Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Quality   Ratings  
  The Securities Valuation Office of the   NAIC   evaluates the fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called  NAIC designations.  If no designation is available from the NAIC, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used. The NAIC designations are generally similar to the credit quality ratings of the NRSRO for fixed maturity securities, except for certain structured securities as described below. Rating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody s, S P, Fitch, Dominion Bond Rating Service, A.M. Best, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Egan Jones Ratings Company and Morningstar, Inc. ( Morningstar ). If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used. 
  The NAIC has adopted revised methodologies for certain structured securities comprised of non-agency RMBS, commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) and ABS. The NAIC s objective with the revised methodologies for these structured securities was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. The revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from structured securities. We apply the revised NAIC methodologies to structured securities held by MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC s present methodology is to evaluate structured securities held by insurers using the revised NAIC methodologies on an annual basis. If MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries acquire structured securities that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, but are expected to be evaluated by the NAIC in the upcoming annual review, an internally developed designation is used until a final designation becomes available.

   U.S. and Foreign Corporate Fixed Maturity Securities 
  We maintain a diversified portfolio of corporate fixed maturity securities across industries and issuers. This portfolio does not have any exposure to any single issuer in excess of   1%   of total investments and the top ten holdings comprise   2%   of total investments at both December 31,   2015   and   2014  .

   RMBS  
  The table below presents our RMBS holdings at: 

Collateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgages into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage or collection of mortgages. The monthly mortgage payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities. 
  The majority of our RMBS holdings were rated Aaa/AAA by Moody s, S P or Fitch; and were designated NAIC 1 by the NAIC at December 31,   2015   and   2014  . Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or Government National Mortgage Association. Non-agency RMBS include prime, alternative residential mortgage loans ( Alt-A ) and sub-prime RMBS. Prime residential mortgage lending includes the origination of residential mortgage loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower falls between prime and sub-prime. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles. 
  Included within prime and Alt-A RMBS are re-securitization of real estate mortgage investment conduit ( Re-REMIC ) securities. Re-REMIC RMBS involve the pooling of previous issues of prime and Alt-A RMBS and restructuring the combined pools to create new senior and subordinated securities. The credit enhancement on the senior tranches is improved through the re-securitization. 
  Historically, we have managed our exposure to sub-prime RMBS holdings by: acquiring older vintage year securities that benefit from better underwriting, improved credit enhancement and higher levels of residential property price appreciation; reducing our overall exposure; stress testing the portfolio with severe loss assumptions; and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio. Since 2012, we have increased our exposure by purchasing sub-prime RMBS at significant discounts to the expected principal recovery value of these securities. The estimated fair value of our sub-prime RMBS holdings purchased since 2012 was   $4.0 billion   and   $3.9 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, with unrealized gains (losses) of   $74 million   and   $130 million   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.

    Overview of Fixed Maturity and Equity Security OTTI Losses Recognized in Earnings 
  Impairments of fixed maturity and equity securities were   $130 million  ,   $96 million   and   $192 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Impairments of fixed maturity securities were   $90 million  ,   $60 million   and   $166 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Impairments of equity securities were   $40 million  ,   $36 million   and   $26 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  Credit-related impairments of fixed maturity securities were   $90 million  ,   $60 million   and   $147 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  Explanations of changes in fixed maturity and equity securities impairments are as follows: 
  Year Ended December 31,   2015   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2014 
  Overall OTTI losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities were   $130 million   for the year ended December 31,   2015   as compared to   $96 million   for the year ended December 31,   2014  . The most significant increases were in U.S. and foreign corporate securities, which comprised   $54 million   for the year ended December 31,   2015  , as compared to   $9 million   for the year ended December 31,   2014  . An increase of   $45 million   in OTTI losses on U.S. and foreign corporate securities reflected the impact of weakening foreign currencies on non-functional currency denominated fixed maturity securities and   lower oil prices impacting the energy sector  . The   $45 million   increase in OTTI losses on U.S. and foreign corporate securities was concentrated in the utility and consumer services industries. 
  Year Ended December 31,   2014   Compared with the Year Ended December 31,   2013 
  Overall OTTI losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities were   $96 million   for the year ended December 31,   2014   as compared to   $192 million   for the year ended December 31,   2013  . The most significant decreases were in U.S. and foreign corporate securities and RMBS, which comprised   $40 million   for the year ended December 31,   2014  , as compared to   $154 million   for the year ended December 31,   2013  . A decrease of   $65 million   in OTTI losses on U.S. and foreign corporate securities and a   $49 million   decrease in OTTI losses on RMBS reflected improving economic fundamentals. The   $65 million   decrease in OTTI losses on U.S. and foreign corporate securities was concentrated in the utility and financial services industries.

   Future Impairments 
  Future OTTI will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), and changes in credit ratings, collateral valuation, interest rates and credit spreads. If economic fundamentals deteriorate or if there are adverse changes in the above factors, OTTI may be incurred in upcoming periods. 
    FVO and Trading Securities 
  FVO and trading securities are primarily comprised of securities for which the FVO has been elected ( FVO Securities ). FVO Securities include certain fixed maturity and equity securities held-for-investment by the general account to support ALM strategies for certain insurance products and investments in certain separate accounts; securities held by CSEs; and trading securities, as further described in Note   1   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FVO and trading securities were   $15.0 billion   and   $16.7 billion   at estimated fair value, or   3.0%   and   3.2%   of total cash and invested assets, at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. See Note   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the FVO and trading securities fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for FVO and trading securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. 
    Securities Lending 
  We participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We obtain collateral, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, which is obtained at the inception of a loan and maintained at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. We monitor the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. We are liable to return to our counterparties the cash collateral under our control. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. These transactions are treated as financing arrangements and the associated cash collateral liability is recorded at the amount of the cash received. 
  See    Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Liquidity and Capital Uses   Securities Lending  and Note   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our securities lending program. 
    Mortgage Loans 
  Our mortgage loans are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties. Mortgage loans and the related valuation allowances are summarized as follows at: 

The information presented in the tables herein exclude mortgage loans where we elected the FVO. Such amounts are presented in Note   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  We originated   $12.8 billion   and   $11.1 billion   of commercial mortgage loans during the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. We originated   $3.2 billion   and   $3.5 billion   of agricultural mortgage loans during the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. While we originate some residential mortgage loans, we purchased a substantial amount of our residential mortgage loans on the secondary market during the years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  . See Note   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on mortgage loan purchases.

   We diversify our mortgage loan portfolio by both geographic region and property type to reduce the risk of concentration. Of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolios,   85%   are collateralized by properties located in the U.S., with the remaining   15%   collateralized by properties located outside the U.S., at December 31,   2015  . The carrying value of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loans located in California, New York and Texas were   19%  ,   12%   and   8%  , respectively, of total mortgage loans at   December 31, 2015  . Additionally, we manage risk when originating commercial and agricultural mortgage loans by generally lending up to 75% of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral. 
  We manage our residential mortgage loan portfolio in a similar manner to reduce risk of concentration, with   91%   collateralized by properties located in the U.S., and the remaining   9%   collateralized by properties located outside the U.S., at   December 31, 2015  . The carrying value of our residential mortgage loans located in California, Florida, and New York were   35%  ,   7%  , and   6%  , respectively. 
  In connection with our investment management business, we manage commercial mortgage loans on behalf of institutional clients, which are unaffiliated investors. These commercial mortgage loans had an estimated fair value of   $2.0 billion   and   $1.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. These assets are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 
  Commercial Mortgage Loans by Geographic Region and Property Type  .

   Mortgage Loan Credit Quality - Monitoring Process.   We monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans that are current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. See Note   8     of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for tables that present mortgage loans by credit quality indicator, past due and nonaccrual mortgage loans, as well as impaired mortgage loans. See    Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures  for real estate acquired through foreclosure. 
  We review our commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios, including reviews on a geographic and sector basis. We review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. See Note   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loans and related valuation allowance methodology. 
  Loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. A loan-to-value ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. A loan-to-value ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the loan-to-value ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The debt service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the debt service coverage ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our commercial mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was   52%   at both December 31,   2015   and   2014  , and our average debt service coverage ratio was   2.6x   at both December 31,   2015   and   2014  . The debt service coverage ratio, as well as the values utilized in calculating the ratio, is updated annually on a rolling basis, with a portion of the portfolio updated each quarter. In addition, the loan-to-value ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. For our agricultural mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was   43%   and   44%   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. The values utilized in calculating the agricultural mortgage loan loan-to-value ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated. 
  Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowances.     Our valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss, as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified, but for which we expect to incur a loss. Accordingly, a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses.    
  The determination of the amount of valuation allowances is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with our loan portfolios. Such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors, including our experience for loan losses, defaults and loss severity, and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the valuation allowance. Positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the valuation allowance.  
  See Notes   1  ,   8   and   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how valuation allowances are established and monitored, activity in and balances of the valuation allowance, and the estimated fair value of impaired mortgage loans and related impairments included within net investment gains (losses) as of and for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . 
    Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures 
  We diversify our real estate investments by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration. Of our real estate investments,   77%   were located in the United States, with the remaining   23%   located outside the United States, at December 31,   2015  . The carrying value of our real estate investments located in Japan, California and DC were   19%  ,   17%   and   8%  , respectively, of total real estate investments at December 31,   2015  .

   Real estate investments by type consisted of the following at: 

We classify within traditional real estate our investment in income-producing real estate, which is comprised of wholly-owned real estate and joint ventures with interests in single property income-producing real estate. The estimated fair value of the traditional and held-for-sale real estate investment portfolios was   $12.4 billion   and   $13.3 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. We classify within real estate joint ventures and funds, our investments in joint ventures with interests in multi-property projects with varying strategies ranging from the development of properties to the operation of income-producing properties, as well as our investments in real estate private equity funds. From time to time, if we intend to retain an interest in the property, we transfer investments from these joint ventures to traditional real estate after the completed property commences operations.  
  In connection with our investment management business, we manage real estate investments on behalf of institutional clients, which are unaffiliated investors. These real estate investments had an estimated fair value of   $3.8 billion   and   $2.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. These assets are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 
  Real estate and real estate joint venture investments by property type are categorized by sector as follows at: 

The Company's authorized equity investment in real estate property was   $1.0 billion   and   $1.7 billion   for the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  
  Impairments recognized on real estate and real estate joint ventures were   $93 million  ,   $20 million   and   $10 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Depreciation expense on real estate investments was   $162 million  ,   $199 million   and   $179 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.

  See Notes   8   and   9   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding tax credit partnerships, leveraged and direct financing leases and freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values, respectively. See Note   1   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, funds withheld and operating joint ventures.  
  Our private placement unit originated   $9.7 billion   and   $8.3 billion   of private investments, comprised primarily of certain privately placed fixed maturity securities and tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, during the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. The carrying value of such private investments included within our consolidated balance sheets was   $49.8 billion   at both December 31,   2015   and   2014  . In addition, we originated $0 and $94 million of private lease investments during the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. The carrying value of such private lease investments included within our consolidated balance sheets was $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    Short-term Investments and Cash Equivalents 
  The carrying value of short-term investments, which approximates estimated fair value, was   $9.3 billion   and   $8.6 billion  , or   1.8%   and   1.7%   of total cash and invested assets, at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. The carrying value of cash equivalents, which approximates estimated fair value, was   $7.5 billion   and   $4.5 billion  , or   1.5%   and   0.9%   of total cash and invested assets, at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    Derivatives  
    Derivative Risks 
  We are exposed to various risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives. See Note   9   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for:

    Fair Value Hierarchy 
  See Note   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy. 
  The valuation of Level 3 derivatives involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations of Level 1 and Level 2 derivatives. Although Level 3 inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. The use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of Level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income. 
  Derivatives categorized as Level 3 at   December 31, 2015   include: interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve; foreign currency swaps and forwards with certain unobservable inputs, including the unobservable portion of the yield curve; credit default swaps priced using unobservable credit spreads, or that are priced through independent broker quotations; equity variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs; and equity index options with unobservable correlation inputs. At   December 31, 2015  , less than 1% of the estimated fair value of our derivatives was priced through independent broker quotations. 
  See Note   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. 
  The gain (loss) on Level 3 derivatives primarily relates to certain purchased equity index options that are valued using models dependent on an unobservable market correlation input, equity variance swaps that are valued using observable equity volatility data plus an unobservable equity variance spread and foreign currency swaps and forwards that are valued using an unobservable portion of the swap yield curve. Other significant inputs, which are observable, include equity index levels, equity volatility and the swap yield curve. We validate the reasonableness of these inputs by valuing the positions using internal models and comparing the results to broker quotations. 
  The gain (loss) on Level 3 derivatives, percentage of gain (loss) attributable to observable and unobservable inputs, and the primary drivers of observable gain (loss) are summarized as follows:  

Year Ended December 31, 2015 
      Gain (loss) recognized in net income (loss)

    Credit Risk 
  See Note   9   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how we manage credit risk related to derivatives and for the estimated fair value of our net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral. 
  Our policy is not to offset the fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. This policy applies to the recognition of derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets, and does not affect our legal right of offset.

   Credit Derivatives 
  The following table presents the gross notional amount and estimated fair value of credit default swaps at: 

__________________ 
            (2) 
    The gross notional amount and estimated fair value for written credit default swaps in the trading portfolio were $20 million and ($2) million, respectively, at   December 31, 2015   and $15 million and $1 million, respectively, at December 31,   2014  .  
     The following table presents the gross gains, gross losses and net gain (losses) recognized in income for credit default swaps as follows:  

__________________ 
           (1) 
    Gains (losses) are reported in net derivative gains (losses), except for gains (losses) on the trading portfolio, which are reported in net investment income. 
              (2) 
    The gross gains and gross (losses) for purchased credit default swaps in the trading portfolio were $8 million and ($11) million, respectively, for the   year ended December 31, 2015   and $5 million and ($5) million, respectively, for the   year ended December 31, 2014  .  
              (3) 
    The gross gains and gross (losses) for written credit default swaps in the trading portfolio were $3 million and ($3) million, respectively, for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and were not significant for the year ended   December 31, 2014  .  
              (4) 
    Gains (losses) do not include earned income (expense) on credit default swaps. 
     The favorable change in net gains (losses) on purchased credit default swaps of $16 million was due to certain credit spreads widening in the current period compared to the prior period on credit default swaps hedging certain bonds. The unfavorable change in net gains (losses) on written credit default swaps of ($104) million was due to certain credit spreads widening in the current period compared to the prior on certain credit default swaps used as replications. 
    141 

       Table of Contents  

   The maximum amount at risk related to our written credit default swaps is equal to the corresponding gross notional amount. In a replication transaction, we pair an asset on our balance sheet with a written credit default swap to synthetically replicate a corporate bond, a core asset holding of life insurance companies. Replications are entered into in accordance with the guidelines approved by insurance regulators and are an important tool in managing the overall corporate credit risk within the Company. In order to match our long-dated insurance liabilities, we will seek to buy long-dated corporate bonds. In some instances, these may not be readily available in the market, or they may be issued by corporations to which we already have significant corporate credit exposure. For example, by purchasing Treasury bonds (or other high-quality assets) and associating them with written credit default swaps on the desired corporate credit name, we, at times, can replicate the desired bond exposures and meet our ALM needs. In addition, given the shorter tenor of the credit default swaps (generally five-year tenors) versus a long-dated corporate bond, we have more flexibility in managing our credit exposures.

    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    Credit and Committed Facilities 
  We maintain an unsecured credit facility, as well as committed facilities with various financial institutions. See    Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Liquidity and Capital Sources   Global Funding Sources   Credit and Committed Facilities  for further descriptions of such arrangements. For the classification of expenses on such credit and committed facilities and the nature of the associated liability for letters of credit issued and drawdowns on these credit and committed facilities, see Note   12   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Collateral for Securities Lending, Repurchase Programs and Derivatives 
  We participate in a securities lending program in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. Periodically we receive non-cash collateral for securities lending from counterparties on deposit from customers, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this collateral was   $50 million   and   $83 million   at estimated fair value at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. See Notes   1   and   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as    Investments   Securities Lending  for discussion of our securities lending program, the classification of revenues and expenses, and the nature of the secured financing arrangement and associated liability. 
  We also participate in third-party custodian administered repurchase programs for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. We loan certain of our fixed maturity securities to financial institutions and, in exchange, non-cash collateral is put on deposit by the financial institutions on our behalf with third-party custodians. The estimated fair value of securities loaned in connection with these transactions was   $738 million   and   $642 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. Non-cash collateral on deposit with third-party custodians on our behalf was   $781 million   and   $682 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. 
  We enter into derivatives to manage various risks relating to our ongoing business operations. We have non-cash collateral from counterparties for derivatives, which can be sold or re-pledged subject to certain constraints, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral was   $2.2 billion   and   $4.2 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. In certain instances, cash collateral pledged to the Company as initial margin for OTC-bilateral derivatives is held in separate custodial accounts and is not recorded on the Company s balance sheet because the account title is in the name of the counterparty (but segregated for the benefit of the Company). The amount of this cash collateral was   $0 million   and $263 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See    Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company   Liquidity and Capital Uses   Pledged Collateral  and  Derivatives  in Note   9   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the earned income on and the gross notional amount, estimated fair value of assets and liabilities and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives.

    Insolvency Assessments 
  See Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Policyholder Liabilities 
  We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations or to provide for future annuity payments. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on Policyholder Liabilities, see    Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.  
  Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial liabilities, we cannot precisely determine the amounts that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial liabilities, and the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts, particularly when payments may not occur until well into the future. 
  We periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities. We charge or credit changes in our liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are established or re-estimated. If the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we must increase them. Such an increase could adversely affect our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  We have experienced, and will likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism, as well as turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing, severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we make broad use of catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils. 
  Insurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. countries in which we operate require certain MetLife entities to prepare a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements, and to submit that analysis to the regulatory authorities.  
  See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Insurance Regulation   Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis  and  Business   Regulation   International Regulation  for further information.

   Future Policy Benefits 
  We establish liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies. See Notes   1   and   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,    Industry Trends   Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment   Low Interest Rate Scenario  and    Variable Annuity Guarantees.  A discussion of future policy benefits by segment (as well as Corporate   Other) follows. 
    Retail 
  Future policy benefits for the life business are comprised mainly of liabilities for traditional life and for universal and variable life insurance contracts. In order to manage risk, we have often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on life insurance policies. The reinsurance programs are routinely evaluated and this may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage. We have entered into various derivative positions, primarily interest rate swaps and swaptions, to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts. For our property   casualty business, future policy benefits include unearned premium reserves and liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses and represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported. For the annuities business, future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life-contingent income annuities, and liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits accounted for as insurance. 
    Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits 
  With the exception of our property   casualty business, future policy benefits for our Group and Voluntary   Worksite businesses are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, liabilities for survivor income benefit insurance, long-term care policies, active life policies and premium stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under life insurance contracts. The components of future policy benefits for the property   casualty products offered by the Voluntary   Worksite and Retail property   casualty businesses are the same. Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim frequencies, levels of severities, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes or regulatory decisions. Assumptions are based upon our historical experience and analyses of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business, and we consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation. 
    Corporate Benefit Funding 
  Liabilities for this segment are primarily related to payout annuities, including pension risk transfers, structured settlement annuities and institutional income annuities. There is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities. As a result, a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings; however, we mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies, including the use of various derivative positions, primarily interest rate floors and interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario. 
    Latin America 
  Future policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for immediate annuities in Chile, Argentina and Mexico and traditional life contracts mainly in Brazil and Mexico. There are also liabilities held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products in Mexico. Factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at policy issuance, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, and mortality and lapses different than expected. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. 
    Asia 
  Future policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for traditional life, endowment, annuity and accident   health contracts. They are also held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products. They include certain liabilities for variable annuity and variable life guarantees of minimum death benefits, and longevity guarantees. Factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at policy issuance, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies.

   EMEA 
  Future policy benefits for this segment include unearned premium reserves for group life and credit insurance contracts. Future policy benefits are also held for traditional life, endowment and annuity contracts with significant mortality risk and accident   health contracts. Factors impacting these liabilities include lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by having premiums which are adjustable or cancellable in some cases, and by applying various ALM strategies. 
    Corporate   Other 
  Future policy benefits primarily include liabilities for certain run-off long-term care and workers  compensation business written by MetLife USA. Additionally, future policy benefits include liabilities for variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits assumed from a former operating joint venture in Japan that are accounted for as insurance. 
    Policyholder Account Balances 
  Policyholder account balances are generally equal to the account value, which includes accrued interest credited, but excludes the impact of any applicable charge that may be incurred upon surrender. See    Industry Trends   Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment   Low Interest Rate Scenario  and    Variable Annuity Guarantees.  See also Notes   1   and   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. A discussion of policyholder account balances by segment (as well as Corporate   Other) follows. 
    Retail 
  Life   Other policyholder account balances are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies and the fixed account of variable life insurance policies. For Annuities, policyholder account balances are held for fixed deferred annuities, the fixed account portion of variable annuities, and non-life contingent income annuities. Interest is credited to the policyholder s account at interest rates we determine which are influenced by current market rates, subject to specified minimums. A sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various derivative positions, primarily interest rate floors, to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario. Additionally, policyholder account balances are held for variable annuity guaranteed minimum living benefits that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. 
  The table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for Retail:

           (1) 
    These amounts are not adjusted for policy loans. 
     As a result of acquisitions, we establish additional liabilities known as excess interest reserves for policies with credited rates in excess of market rates as of the applicable acquisition dates. At December 31,   2015  , excess interest reserves were $110 million and $328 million for Life   Other and Annuities, respectively.

   Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits 
  Policyholder account balances in this segment are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs. Policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate we determine, which are influenced by current market rates. A sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various derivative positions, primarily interest rate floors, to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario.

       Corporate Benefit Funding 
  Policyholder account balances in this segment are comprised of funding agreements. Interest crediting rates vary by type of contract, and can be fixed or variable. Variable interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external index, most commonly (1-month or 3-month) LIBOR. We are exposed to interest rate risks, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk, when guaranteeing payment of interest and return of principal at the contractual maturity date. We may invest in floating rate assets or enter into receive-floating interest rate swaps, also tied to external indices, as well as caps, to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates. We also mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and seek to hedge all foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency hedges, including cross currency swaps. 
    Latin America 
  Policyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for investment-type products and universal life products in Mexico and Chile, and deferred annuities in Brazil. Some of the deferred annuities in Brazil are unit-linked-type funds that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. The rest of the deferred annuities have minimum credited rate guarantees, and these liabilities and the universal life liabilities are generally impacted by sustained periods of low interest rates. Liabilities for unit-linked-type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder. 
    Asia 
  Policyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans, fixed deferred annuities, interest sensitive whole life products, universal life and, to a lesser degree, liability amounts for unit-linked-type funds that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. Also included are certain liabilities for retirement and savings products sold in certain countries in Asia that generally are sold with minimum credited rate guarantees. Liabilities for guarantees on certain variable annuities in Asia are accounted for as embedded derivatives and recorded at estimated fair value and are also included within policyholder account balances. These liabilities are generally impacted by sustained periods of low interest rates, where there are interest rate guarantees. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and with reinsurance. Liabilities for unit-linked-type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated underlying investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder.

These liabilities were established in instances where the estimated fair value of contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed insurance policy liabilities associated with the acquisition of ALICO. These negative liabilities were established primarily for decreased market interest rates subsequent to the issuance of the policy contracts. 
              (2) 
    These amounts are not adjusted for policy loans. 
       EMEA 
  Policyholder account balances in this segment are held mostly for universal life, deferred annuity, pension products, and unit-linked-type funds that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. They are also held for endowment products without significant mortality risk. Where there are interest rate guarantees, these liabilities are generally impacted by sustained periods of low interest rates. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. Liabilities for unit-linked-type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder. 
    Corporate   Other 
  Policyholder account balances in Corporate   Other are held for variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits assumed from a former operating joint venture in Japan that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. 
    Variable Annuity Guarantees 
  We issue, directly and through assumed business, certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the benefit base) less withdrawals. In some cases, the benefit base may be increased by additional deposits, bonus amounts, accruals or optional market value resets. See Notes   1   and   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
  Certain guarantees, including portions thereof, have insurance liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits. Guarantees accounted for in this manner include GMDBs, the life-contingent portion of certain GMWBs, and the non-life contingent portions of both GMWBs and GMIBs that require annuitization. These liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns. The scenarios are based on best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize DAC. When current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected, liabilities will increase, resulting in a current period charge to net income. The opposite result occurs when the current estimates of future benefits are lower than those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected. At each reporting period, we update the actual amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings.

     Table of Contents  

   Certain guarantees, including portions thereof, accounted for as embedded derivatives, are recorded at estimated fair value and included in policyholder account balances. Guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include GMABs, and the non-life contingent portions of both GMWBs and GMIBs that do not require annuitization. The estimated fair values of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used to project the cash flows from the guarantees under multiple capital market scenarios to determine an economic liability. The reported estimated fair value is then determined by taking the present value of these risk-free generated cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates a spread over the risk-free rate to reflect our nonperformance risk and adding a risk margin. For more information on the determination of estimated fair value, see Note   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The table below contains the carrying value for guarantees at: 

The carrying amounts for guarantees included in policyholder account balances above include nonperformance risk adjustments of $462 million and $299 million at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. These nonperformance risk adjustments represent the impact of including a credit spread when discounting the underlying risk neutral cash flows to determine the estimated fair values. The nonperformance risk adjustment does not have an economic impact on us as it cannot be monetized given the nature of these policyholder liabilities. The change in valuation arising from the nonperformance risk adjustment is not hedged. 
  The carrying values of these guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance, equity volatility, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. Carrying values are also impacted by our assumptions around mortality, separate account returns and policyholder behavior, including lapse rates.

   As discussed below, we use a combination of product design, hedging strategies, reinsurance, and other risk management actions to mitigate the risks related to these benefits. Within each type of guarantee, there is a range of product offerings reflecting the changing nature of these products over time. Changes in product features and terms are in part driven by customer demand but, more importantly, reflect our risk management practices of continuously evaluating the guaranteed benefits and their associated asset-liability matching. Recently, we have been diversifying the concentration of income benefits in the portfolio of the Company s Retail Annuities business by focusing on withdrawal benefits, variable annuities without living benefits and index-linked annuities. To this end, the GMIBs will not be available for new purchases after February 19, 2016.  
  The sections below provide further detail by total account value for certain of our most popular guarantees. Total account values include amounts not reported in the consolidated balance sheets from assumed business, contractholder-directed investments which do not qualify for presentation as separate account assets, and amounts included in our general account. The total account values and the net amounts at risk include direct and assumed business, but exclude offsets from hedging or ceded reinsurance, if any. 
    GMDBs 
  We offer a range of GMDBs to our contractholders. The table below presents GMDBs, by benefit type, at December 31,   2015  : 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Total account value excludes $2.1billion for contracts with no GMDBs. Further, many of our annuity contracts offer more than one type of guarantee such that GMDB amounts listed above are not mutually exclusive to the amounts in the living benefit guarantees table below. 
     Based on total account value, less than 39% of our GMDBs included enhanced death benefits such as the annual step-up or roll-up and step-up combination products. We expect the above GMDB risk profile to be relatively consistent for the foreseeable future. 
    Living Benefit Guarantees 
  The table below presents our living benefit guarantees based on total account values at December 31,   2015  : 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Total account value excludes $48.1 billion for contracts with no living benefit guarantees. Further, many of our annuity contracts offer more than one type of guarantee such that living benefit guarantee amounts listed above are not mutually exclusive of the amounts in the GMDBs table above. 
              (2) 
    The Asia and EMEA segments include the non-life contingent portion of the GMWB total account value of $948 million with a guarantee at annuitization.

     Table of Contents  

   In terms of total account value, GMIBs are our most significant living benefit guarantee. Our primary risk management strategy for our GMIB products is our derivatives hedging program as discussed below. Additionally, we have engaged in certain reinsurance agreements covering some of our GMIB business. As part of our overall risk management approach for living benefit guarantees, we continually monitor the reinsurance markets for the right opportunity to purchase additional coverage for our GMIB business. 
  The table below presents our GMIB associated total account values, by their guaranteed payout basis, at December 31,   2015  : 

The annuitization interest rates on GMIBs have been decreased from 2.5% to 0.5% over time, partially in response to the low interest rate environment, accompanied by an increase in the setback period from seven years to 10 years and the more recent introduction of a 10-year mortality projection. 
  Additionally, 33% of the $90.3 billion of GMIB total account value has been invested in managed volatility funds as of December 31,   2015  . These funds seek to manage volatility by adjusting the fund holdings within certain guidelines based on capital market movements. Such activity reduces the overall risk of the underlying funds while maintaining their growth opportunities. These risk mitigation techniques translate to a reduction or elimination of the need for us to manage the funds  volatility through hedging or reinsurance.  
  Our GMIB products typically have a waiting period of 10 years to be eligible for annuitization. As of December 31,   2015  , only 15% of our contracts with GMIBs were eligible for annuitization. The remaining contracts are not eligible for annuitization for an average of six years. 
  Once eligible for annuitization, contractholders would only be expected to annuitize if their contracts were in-the-money. We calculate in-the-moneyness with respect to GMIBs consistent with net amount at risk as discussed in Note   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, by comparing the contractholders  income benefits based on total account values and current annuity rates versus the guaranteed income benefits. The net amount at risk was $2,762 million at December 31,   2015  , of which $2,619 million was related to GMIB guarantees. For those contracts with GMIB, the table below presents details of contracts that are in-the-money and out-of-the money at December 31,   2015  :

   Derivatives Hedging Variable Annuity Guarantees 
  Our risk mitigating hedging strategy uses various OTC and exchange traded derivatives. The table below presents the gross notional amount, estimated fair value and primary underlying risk exposure of the derivatives hedging our variable annuity guarantees: 

The change in estimated fair values of our derivatives is recorded in policyholder benefits and claims if they are hedging guarantees included in future policy benefits, and in net derivative gains (losses) if they are hedging guarantees included in policyholder account balances. 
  Our hedging strategy involves the significant use of static longer-term derivative instruments to avoid the need to execute transactions during periods of market disruption or higher volatility. We continually monitor the capital markets for opportunities to adjust our liability coverage, as appropriate. Futures are also used to dynamically adjust the daily coverage levels as markets and liability exposures fluctuate. 
  We remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. Certain of our reinsurance agreements and most derivative positions are collateralized and derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements, both of which significantly reduce the exposure to counterparty risk. In addition, we are subject to the risk that hedging and other risk management actions prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed. 
    Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    Overview 
  Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. The global markets and economy continue to experience volatility that may affect our financing costs and market interest for our debt or equity securities. For further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see    Industry Trends  and    Investments   Current Environment.  
    Liquidity Management 
  Based upon the strength of our franchise, diversification of our businesses, strong financial fundamentals and the substantial funding sources available to us as described herein, we continue to believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities. 
    151 

       Table of Contents  

   Short-term Liquidity 
  We maintain a substantial short-term liquidity position, which was $11.1 billion and $14.0 billion at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Short-term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed including: (i) amounts related to cash collateral received under our securities lending program; (ii) amounts related to cash collateral received from counterparties in connection with derivatives; and (iii) cash held in the closed block.  
    Liquid Assets 
  An integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets, which was $229.4 billion and $237.4 billion at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include: (i) amounts related to cash collateral received under our securities lending program; (ii) amounts related to cash collateral received from counterparties in connection with derivatives; (iii) cash and investments held in the closed block, in regulatory custodial accounts or on deposit with regulatory agencies; (iv) investments held in trust in support of collateral financing arrangements; and (v) investments pledged in support of funding agreements, derivatives and short sale agreements. 
    Capital Management 
  We have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process. These committees, including the Capital Management Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee ( ERC ), regularly review actual and projected capital levels (under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios) and our annual capital plan in accordance with our capital policy. The Capital Management Committee is comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc. s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Risk Officer ( CRO ). The ERC is also comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc. s Chief Financial Officer, CRO and Chief Investment Officer. 
  Our Board and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of our capital policy. The capital policy sets forth, among other things, minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process. All capital actions, including proposed changes to the annual capital plan, capital targets or capital policy, are reviewed by the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board prior to obtaining full Board approval. The Board approves the capital policy and the annual capital plan and authorizes capital actions, as required. 
  See  Risk Factors   Capital-Related Risks   Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish  and Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restrictions on payment of dividends and stock repurchases. See also    The Company   Liquidity and Capital Uses   Common Stock Repurchases  for information regarding MetLife, Inc. s common stock repurchase authorizations. 
    The Company 
    Liquidity 
  Liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs. We determine our liquidity needs based on a rolling 12-month forecast by portfolio of invested assets which we monitor daily. We adjust the asset mix and asset maturities based on this rolling 12-month forecast. To support this forecast, we conduct cash flow and stress testing, which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. We include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of our products, including general account pension products sold to employee benefit plan sponsors. Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources and various credit facilities. 
    152 

     Table of Contents  

   Under certain stressful market and economic conditions, our access to liquidity may deteriorate, or the cost to access liquidity may increase. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements or if we are required to post or return cash collateral in connection with derivatives or our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. In addition, in the event of such forced sale, accounting guidance requires the recognition of a loss for certain securities in an unrealized loss position and may require the impairment of other securities if there is a need to sell such securities, which may negatively impact our financial condition. See  Risk Factors   Investment-Related Risks   Should the Need Arise, We May Have Difficulty Selling Certain Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner and Realizing Full Value Given Their Illiquid Nature.  
  In extreme circumstances, all general account assets within a particular legal entity   other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose   are available to fund obligations of the general account of that legal entity. 
    Capital 
  We manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions. 
    Rating Agencies 
  Rating agencies assign insurer financial strength ratings to MetLife, Inc. s domestic life insurance subsidiaries and credit ratings to MetLife, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries. Financial strength ratings represent the opinion of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to pay obligations under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. Credit ratings indicate the rating agency s opinion regarding a debt issuer s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. They are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. The level and composition of regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our insurer financial strength ratings and credit ratings. Each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors. In addition to heightening the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies, rating agencies have increased and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. See  Business   Company Ratings  for further information on our insurer financial strength ratings. 
  Downgrades in our insurer financial strength ratings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including: 
             
    reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and investment products; 
                
    adversely affecting our relationships with our sales force and independent sales intermediaries; 
                
    materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders; 
                
    requiring us to post additional collateral under certain of our financing and derivative transactions; 
                
    requiring us to reduce prices for our products and services to remain competitive; and 
                
    adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices or at all. 
     A downgrade in the credit ratings or insurer financial strength ratings of MetLife, Inc. or its subsidiaries would likely impact us in the following ways, including: 
             
    impact our ability to generate cash flows from the sale of funding agreements and other capital market products offered by our Corporate Benefit Funding segment; 
                
    impact the cost and availability of financing for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries; and 
                
    result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting investments held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. See    Liquidity and Capital Uses   Pledged Collateral.  
       153 

       Table of Contents  

   Statutory Capital and Dividends 
  Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements. 
  RBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. These rules apply to most of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. At the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels. 
  As a Delaware corporation, American Life is subject to Delaware law; however, because it does not conduct insurance business in Delaware or any other domestic state, it is exempt from RBC requirements under Delaware law. American Life s operations are also regulated by applicable authorities of the countries in which it operates and is subject to capital and solvency requirements in those countries. 
  The amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay to MetLife, Inc. or to other parent entities is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings and provides an additional margin for risk protection and investment in our businesses. We proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which may include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital. Certain of these activities may require regulatory approval. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and other distributions to MetLife, Inc. and other parent entities by their respective insurance subsidiaries is governed by insurance laws and regulations. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Insurance Regulation,   Business   Regulation   International Regulation,     MetLife, Inc.   Liquidity and Capital Sources   Dividends from Subsidiaries  and Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions 
  Various subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. cede specific policy classes, including term and universal life insurance, participating whole life insurance, long-term disability insurance, group life insurance and other business to various wholly-owned captive reinsurers. The reinsurance activities among these affiliated companies are eliminated within our consolidated results of operations. The statutory reserves of such affiliated captive reinsurers are supported by a combination of funds withheld assets, investment assets and letters of credit issued by unaffiliated financial institutions. MetLife, Inc. has committed to maintain the surplus of several of the domestic affiliated captive reinsurers, as well as provided guarantees of the reinsurers  and other affiliated international insurance entities  repayment obligations on the letters of credit. MetLife, Inc. has also provided guarantees of these reinsurers  repayment obligations on derivative and certain reinsurance agreements entered into by these reinsurers. See    MetLife, Inc.   Liquidity and Capital Uses   Support Agreements  for further details on certain of these guarantees. Various subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. enter into reinsurance agreements with affiliated captive reinsurers for risk and capital management purposes, as well as to manage statutory reserve requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies and other business.  
  The NAIC continues to review insurance companies  use of affiliated captive reinsurers and off-shore entities. The New York Department of Financial Services continues to have a moratorium on new reserve financing transactions involving captive insurers. We are not aware of any states other than New York and California implementing such a moratorium. While such a moratorium would not impact our existing reinsurance agreements with captive reinsurers, a moratorium placed on the use of captives for new reserve financing transactions could impact our ability to write certain products and/or impact our RBC ratios and ability to deploy excess capital in the future. This could result in our need to increase prices, modify product features or limit the availability of those products to our customers. While this affects insurers across the industry, it could adversely impact our competitive position and our results of operations in the future. We continue to evaluate product modifications, pricing structure and alternative means of managing risks, capital and statutory reserves and we expect the discontinued use of captive reinsurance on new reserve financing transactions would not have a material impact on our future consolidated financial results.

   Our variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefit risk and certain other risks were previously ceded to an affiliated captive reinsurer. In November 2014, this captive reinsurer merged with and into MetLife USA as part of the Mergers, further reducing the Company s exposure to and use of captive reinsurers. See    Executive Summary   Other Key Information   Significant Events  for further information on the Mergers.

    Summary of the Company s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital 
  Our primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital are summarized as follows: 

Cash Flows from Operations 
  The principal cash inflows from our insurance activities come from insurance premiums, net investment income, annuity considerations and deposit funds. The principal cash outflows relate to various life insurance, property   casualty, annuity and pension products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense. A primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. 
    155 

       Table of Contents  

   Cash Flows from Investments 
  The principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. Additional cash outflows relate to purchases of businesses. We typically have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our ALM discipline to fund insurance liabilities. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption. 
    Cash Flows from Financing 
  The principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt, payments of dividends on and repurchases of MetLife, Inc. s securities, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are market disruption and the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. 
    Liquidity and Capital Sources 
  In addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in    Summary of the Company s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,  the following additional information is provided regarding our primary sources of liquidity and capital: 
    Global Funding Sources 
  Liquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit facilities and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt, collateral financing arrangements, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities. The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. Our primary global funding sources include: 
  Preferred Stock 
  In June 2015, MetLife, Inc. issued 1,500,000 shares of 5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C (the  Series C preferred stock ), with a $0.01 par value per share and a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $1.5 billion. See Note     16     of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information  . 
  Common Stock 
  In October 2014 and September 2013, MetLife, Inc. issued 22,907,960 new shares and 22,679,955 new shares, respectively, of its common stock, each for $1.0 billion, in connection with the remarketing of senior debt securities and settlement of stock purchase contracts. See    Remarketing of Senior Debt Securities and Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts.  
  Commercial Paper, Reported in Short-term Debt 
  MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding, Inc. ( MetLife Funding ) each have a commercial paper program that is supported by the $4.0 billion general corporate credit facility (see    Credit and Committed Facilities ). MetLife Funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of MLIC, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies. 
  Federal Home Loan Bank Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances 
  Certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries are members of a regional FHLB. During the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , we issued $21.6 billion, $13.9 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively, and repaid $21.1 billion, $14.0 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively, under funding agreements with certain regional FHLBs. At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $15.5 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively. See Note   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   Special Purpose Entity Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances 
  We issue fixed and floating rate funding agreements which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, to certain SPEs that have issued either debt securities or commercial paper for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements. During the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , we issued $48.1 billion, $48.9 billion and $37.7 billion, respectively, and repaid $49.9 billion, $45.6 billion and $36.8 billion, respectively, under such funding agreements. At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $31.6 billion and $33.9 billion, respectively. See Note   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances 
  We have issued funding agreements to Farmer Mac, as well as to certain SPEs that have issued debt securities for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements, and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment of interest and principal by Farmer Mac. The obligations under all such funding agreements are secured by a pledge of certain eligible agricultural real estate mortgage loans. During the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , we issued $50 million and $200 million, respectively, and repaid $250 million and $200 million, respectively, under such funding agreements. During the year ended December 31,   2013  , there were no issuances or repayments under such funding agreements. At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. See Note   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Debt Issuances and Other Borrowings 
  See Note   12   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the following issuances of debt and other borrowings:  
             
    In December 2015, MetLife Private Equity Holdings, LLC ( MPEH ), a wholly-owned indirect investment subsidiary of MLIC, borrowed $350 million under term loans that mature in December 2020 (see  Other Notes  in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information); 
                
    In November 2015, MetLife, Inc. issued $1.3 billion of senior notes for general corporate purposes, which include repayment of certain senior notes upon their maturity in 2016; 
                
    In March 2015, MetLife, Inc. issued $1.5 billion of senior notes for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of certain senior notes upon their maturity in 2015; 
                
    In April 2014, MetLife, Inc. issued $1.0 billion of senior notes for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of certain senior notes upon their maturity in 2014 and the redemption of certain senior notes due in 2033; and 
                
    In November 2013, MetLife, Inc. issued $1.0 billion of senior notes for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of certain senior notes upon their maturity in 2014. 
     Remarketing of Senior Debt Securities and Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts 
  In each of October 2014 and September 2013, MetLife, Inc. closed the successful remarketings of $1.0 billion of senior debt securities underlying common equity units issued in November 2010 in connection with the acquisition of ALICO. MetLife, Inc. did not receive any proceeds from the remarketings. Most common equity unit holders used the remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under the applicable stock purchase contracts. The subsequent settlement of the stock purchase contracts provided proceeds to MetLife, Inc. of $1.0 billion in each of October 2014 and September 2013 in exchange for newly issued shares of MetLife, Inc. s common stock as described in    Common Stock  above. 
  See Note   15   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Credit and Committed Facilities 
  At   December 31, 2015  , we maintained a $4.0 billion unsecured credit facility and certain committed facilities aggregating $11.9 billion. When drawn upon, these facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance with the respective agreements. 
  The unsecured credit facility is used for general corporate purposes, to support the borrowers  commercial paper programs and for the issuance of letters of credit. At   December 31, 2015  , we had outstanding $484 million in letters of credit and no drawdowns against this facility. Remaining availability was $3.5 billion at   December 31, 2015  . 
    157 

     Table of Contents  

   The committed facilities are used for collateral for certain of our affiliated reinsurance liabilities. At December 31,   2015  , $6.6 billion in letters of credit and $2.8 billion in aggregate drawdowns under collateral financing arrangements were outstanding. Remaining availability was $2.4 billion at December 31,   2015  . 
  See Note   12   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about these facilities. 
  We have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under these facilities. As commitments associated with letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements. 
    Outstanding Debt Under Global Funding Sources 
  The following table summarizes our outstanding debt at: 
   
 ______________ 
           (1) 
    Excludes $60 million and $151 million at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, of long-term debt relating to CSEs   FVO (see Note   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For more information regarding long-term debt, see Note   12   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
              (2) 
    Includes $408 million and $59 million of non-recourse debt at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, for which creditors have no access, subject to customary exceptions, to the general assets of the Company other than recourse to certain investment subsidiaries.

       Debt and Facility Covenants 
  Certain of our debt instruments and committed facilities, as well as our unsecured credit facility, contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We believe we were in compliance with all such covenants at   December 31, 2015  . 
    Dispositions 
  Cash proceeds from dispositions during the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were $0, $759 million and $407 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the sale of MetLife Bank s depository business resulted in cash outflows of $6.4 billion as a result of the buyer s assumption of the bank deposits liability in exchange for our cash payment.

   Preferred Stock Repurchase 
  In June 2015, MetLife, Inc. conducted a tender offer for up to 59,850,000 of its 60,000,000 shares of the 6.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B ( Series B preferred stock ), at a purchase price of $25 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued, unpaid and undeclared dividends from, and including, June 15, 2015 to, but excluding, June 29, 2015, the settlement date of the tender offer. In June 2015, MetLife, Inc. also delivered a notice of redemption to the holders of the Series B preferred stock, pursuant to which it would redeem any Series B preferred stock not purchased by it in the tender offer at a redemption price of $25 per share, without any payment for accrued, unpaid and undeclared dividends on the Series B preferred stock from, and including, June 15, 2015 to, but excluding Ju  ly 1, 2015, the redemption date. On June 29, 2015, MetLife, Inc. repurchased and canceled 37,192,413 shares of Series B preferred stock in the tender offer for $932 million in cash. On July 1, 2015, MetLife, Inc. redeemed and canceled the remaining 22,807,587 shares of Series B preferred stock not tendered in the tender offer for an aggregate redemption price of $570 million in cash. In connection with the tender offer and redemption, MetLife, Inc. recognized a preferred stock repurchase premium of $42 million (calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the Series B preferred stock and the total amount paid by MetLife, Inc. to the holders of the Series B preferred stock in connection with the tender offer and redemption), which was reflected as a reduction to retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet. See   Note 16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Common Stock Repurchases 
  In August 2014, MetLife, Inc. completed the remaining $261 million in common stock repurchases under a $1.0 billion authorization by the Board of Directors announced on January 15, 2008. In January 2015, MetLife, Inc. completed $1.0 billion of common stock repurchases pursuant to a Board of Directors authorization announced on April 22, 2008. On December 12, 2014, MetLife, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized $1.0 billion of common stock repurchases in addition to previously authorized purchases, and on September 22, 2015, MetLife, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors     authorized additional repurchases of $739 million of its common stock, bringing MetLife, Inc. s remaining available repurchase authorizations to $1.0 billion as of September 22, 2015.     In October 2015, MetLife, Inc. completed all remaining repurchases under the $1.0 billion authorization announced by the Board of Directors on December 12, 2014.     At     December 31, 2015  , MetLife, Inc. had     $70 million     remaining under the September 2015 common stock repurchase authorization. MetLife, Inc. subsequently completed all repurchases under this authorization in January 2016. Under these authorizations, MetLife, Inc. may purchase its common stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust, in the open market (including pursuant to the terms of a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act) and in privately negotiated transactions. 
  During the years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , MetLife, Inc. repurchased   39,491,991   and 18,876,363 shares of common stock in the open market for $  1.9 billion   and $1.0 billion, respectively. MetLife, Inc. did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the year ended December 31,   2013  . In   2016  , through   January 7, 2016  , MetLife, Inc. repurchased   1,445,864   shares of its common stock in the open market for   $70 million   completing the September 2015 authorization. 
  Common stock repurchases are dependent upon several factors, including our capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions, the market price of MetLife, Inc. s common stock compared to management s assessment of the stock s underlying value and applicable regulatory approvals, as well as other legal and accounting factors. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI,   Business   Regulation   International Regulation   Global Systemically Important Insurers,   Risk Factors   Capital-Related Risks   Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish  and Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Dividends 
  During the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its common stock of   $1.7 billion  ,   $1.5 billion   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively. During the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its preferred stock of   $116 million  ,   $122 million  , and   $122 million  , respectively. See Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the calculation and timing of these dividend payments. 
    159 

     Table of Contents  

   The declaration and payment of common stock dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend on MetLife, Inc. s financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. On   January 6, 2016  , the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors declared a   first quarter 2016   common stock dividend of   $0.375   per share payable on   March 14, 2016   to shareholders of record as of   February 5, 2016  . The Company estimates the aggregate dividend payment will be   $413 million  . 
  Preferre  d stock dividends are paid quarterly in accordance with the terms of MetLife, Inc. s Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A   and, ending with the June 15, 2015 payment date for the Series B preferred stock. D  ividends are paid semi-annually on MetLife, Inc. s Series C preferred stock commencing December 15, 2015 and ending on June 15, 2020, and thereafter are paid quarterly.  
  The payment of dividends and other distributions by MetLife, Inc. to its security holders may be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve as a result of MetLife, Inc. s designation as a non-bank SIFI. See  Business   Regulation   U.S. Regulation   Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI.  In addition, if additional capital requirements are imposed on MetLife, Inc. as a G-SII, its ability to pay dividends could be reduced by any such additional capital requirements that might be imposed. See  Business   Regulation   International Regulation   Global Systemically Important Insurers.  The payment of dividends is also subject to restrictions under the terms of our preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures in situations where we may be experiencing financial stress. See  Risk Factors   Capital-Related Risks   Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish  and Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Debt Repayments 
  See Notes   12   and   13   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on long-term and short-term debt and collateral financing arrangements, respectively, including: 
              
    In 2015, following regulatory approval, MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston ( MRC ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., repurchased and canceled $57 million in aggregate principal amount of its surplus notes; 
                
    In June and February 2014, MetLife, Inc. repaid at maturity its $350 million and $1.0 billion senior notes, respectively; 
         Debt Repurchases 
  We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not to repurchase any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at our discretion. 
    Support Agreements 
  MetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries (each, an  Obligor ) are parties to various capital support commitments and guarantees with subsidiaries. Under these arrangements, each Obligor, with respect to the applicable entity, has agreed to cause such entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels or has guaranteed certain contractual obligations. We anticipate that in the event that these arrangements place demands upon us, there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable us to meet anticipated demands. See    MetLife, Inc.   Liquidity and Capital Uses   Support Agreements.

       Table of Contents  

   Insurance Liabilities 
  Liabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various life insurance, property   casualty, annuity and group pension products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type products, surrender or lapse behavior differs somewhat by segment. In the Retail segment, which includes individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the normal course of business. During the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , general account surrenders and withdrawals from annuity products were $3.8 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. In the Corporate Benefit Funding segment, which includes pension risk transfers, bank-owned life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital market products, most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With regard to the Corporate Benefit Funding segment liabilities that provide customers with limited rights to accelerate payments, as of December 31,   2015  , there were no funding agreements and other capital market products that could be put back to the Company. 
    Pledged Collateral 
  We pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by, counterparties in connection with our derivatives. At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , we were obligated to return cash collateral pledged to the Company of $  6.6 billion   and   $4.6 billion  , respectively. At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , we had pledged cash collateral of   $241 million   and   $391 million  , respectively. With respect to OTC-bilateral derivatives in a net liability position that have credit contingent provisions, a one-notch downgrade in the Company s credit rating would have required   $1 million   of additional collateral be provided to our counterparties as of December 31,   2015  . See Note   9   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about collateral pledged to us, collateral we pledge and derivatives subject to credit contingent provisions.  
  We pledged collateral and have had collateral pledged to us, and may be required from time to time to pledge additional collateral or be entitled to have additional collateral pledged to us, in connection with collateral financing arrangements related to the reinsurance of closed block and ULSG liabilities. See Note   13   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  We pledged collateral from time to time in connection with funding agreements. See Note   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Securities Lending 
  We participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the loaned securities are returned to us. Under our securities lending program, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of   $30.2 billion   and   $30.8 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Of these amounts,   $10.1 billion   and   $10.7 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, were on open, meaning that the related loaned security could be returned to us on the next business day requiring the immediate return of cash collateral we hold. The estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to the cash collateral on open at December 31,   2015   was   $9.9 billion  , over   99%   of which were U.S. Treasury and agency securities which, if put to us, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirements to immediately return the cash collateral. See Note   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Litigation 
  Putative or certified class action litigation and other litigation, and claims and assessments against us, in addition to those discussed elsewhere herein and those otherwise provided for in the consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of our business, including, but not limited to, in connection with our activities as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor, taxpayer and, formerly, a mortgage lending bank. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. See Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    161 

     Table of Contents  

   We establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For material matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable, no accrual is made but we disclose the nature of the contingency and an aggregate estimate of the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, when such an estimate can be made. It is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to herein, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these considerations, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon our financial position, based on information currently known by us, in our opinion, the outcome of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. 
    Acquisitions 
  Cash outflows for acquisitions and investments in strategic partnerships during the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were $0, $277 million and $1.9 billion, respectively. See Note   3   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding acquisitions. 
    Contractual Obligations 
  The following table summarizes our major contractual obligations at December 31,   2015  : 

Insurance Liabilities 
  Insurance liabilities include future policy benefits, other policy-related balances, policyholder dividends payable and the policyholder dividend obligation, which are all reported on the consolidated balance sheet and are more fully described in Notes   1   and   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amounts presented reflect future estimated cash payments and (i) are based on mortality, morbidity, lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience and expectations of future payment patterns; and (ii) consider future premium receipts on current policies in-force. All estimated cash payments presented are undiscounted as to interest, net of estimated future premiums on in-force policies and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. Payment of amounts related to policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity. Because the exact timing and amount of the ultimate policyholder dividend obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the policyholder dividend obligation is based upon a long-term projection of the performance of the closed block, we have reflected the obligation at the amount of the liability, if any, presented in the consolidated balance sheet in the more than five years category. Additionally, the more than five years category includes estimated payments due for periods extending for more than 100 years. 
  The sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years of $377.0 billion exceeds the liability amounts of $208.6 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; and (ii) differences in assumptions, most significantly mortality, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and are partially offset by liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded. 
    162 

     Table of Contents  

   Actual cash payments may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheets and the estimated cash payments as presented due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments. 
  For the majority of our insurance operations, estimated contractual obligations for future policy benefits and policyholder account balances, as presented, are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes. These cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under GAAP. See    Policyholder Account Balances.  
    Policyholder Account Balances 
  See Notes   1   and   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the components of policyholder account balances. See    Insurance Liabilities  regarding the source and uncertainties associated with the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances. 
  Amounts presented represent the estimated cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges; annuitization; mortality; future interest credited; policy loans and other contingent events as appropriate for the respective product type. Such estimated cash payments are also presented net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in-force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. For obligations denominated in foreign currencies, cash payments have been estimated using current spot foreign currency rates. 
  The sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years of $286.1 billion exceeds the liability amount of $202.7 billion included on the consolidated balance sheets principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded. 
    Payables for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other Transactions 
  We have accepted cash collateral in connection with securities lending and derivatives. As the securities lending transactions expire within the next year and the timing of the return of the derivatives collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the one year or less category in the table. We also held non-cash collateral, which is not reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet of $2.2 billion at December 31,   2015  . 
    Debt 
  Amounts presented for debt include short-term debt, long-term debt, collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities, the total of which differs from the total of the corresponding amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheet due to the following: (i) the amounts presented herein do not include premiums or discounts upon issuance or purchase accounting fair value adjustments; (ii) the amounts presented herein include future interest on such obligations for the period from January 1, 2016 through maturity; and (iii) the amounts presented herein do not include $60 million at December 31,   2015   of long-term debt relating to CSEs   FVO as such debt does not represent our contractual obligation. Future interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at December 31,   2015   and, as such, does not consider the impact of future rate movements. Future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations for the period from January 1, 2016 through maturity, except with respect to junior subordinated debt which was computed using the stated rates through the scheduled redemption dates as it is our expectation that such obligations will be redeemed at that time. Inclusion of interest payments on junior subordinated debt securities through the final maturity dates would increase the contractual obligation by $7.7 billion. Pursuant to collateral financing arrangements, MetLife, Inc. may be required to deliver cash or pledge collateral to the respective unaffiliated financial institutions. See Note   13   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Investment Commitments 
  To enhance the return on our investment portfolio, we commit to lend funds under mortgage loans, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments and we commit to fund partnership investments. In the table, the timing of the funding of mortgage loans and private corporate bond investments is based on the expiration dates of the corresponding commitments. As it relates to commitments to fund partnerships and bank credit facilities, we anticipate that these amounts could be invested any time over the next five years; however, as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted, such obligations are generally presented in the one year or less category. Commitments to fund bridge loans are short-term obligations and, as a result, are presented in the one year or less category. See Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  
    163 

       Table of Contents  

   Operating Leases 
  As a lessee, we have various operating leases, primarily for office space. Contractual provisions exist that could increase or accelerate those lease obligations presented, including various leases with early buyouts and/or escalation clauses. However, the impact of any such transactions would not be material to our financial position or results of operations. See Note   21   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    Other 
  Other obligations presented are principally comprised of amounts due under reinsurance agreements, payables related to securities purchased but not yet settled, securities sold short, accrued interest on debt obligations, estimated fair value of derivative obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, guaranty liabilities, and accruals and accounts payable due under contractual obligations, which are all reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. If the timing of any of these other obligations is sufficiently uncertain, the amounts are included within the one year or less category. Items reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets that were excluded from the table represent accounting conventions or are not liabilities due under contractual obligations. Unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest totaling $2.0 billion was excluded as the timing of payment cannot be reliably determined. 
  Separate account liabilities are excluded as they are fully funded by cash flows from the corresponding separate account assets and are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets. 
  We also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, such amounts are excluded as these purchase obligations were not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position at December 31,   2015  . 
  Additionally, we have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate insurance regulators as required.

    Liquidity and Capital Management 
  Liquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale financial markets and the ability to borrow through credit and committed facilities. Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on MetLife, Inc. s liquidity. MetLife, Inc. is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of MetLife, Inc. s liquidity and capital management.

    Liquid Assets 
  At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , MetLife, Inc. and other MetLife holding companies had $6.4 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, in liquid assets. Of these amounts, $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion were held by MetLife, Inc. and $1.1 billion and $681 million were held by other MetLife holding companies at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include: (i) amounts related to cash collateral received from counterparties in connection with derivatives; (ii) investments held in trust in support of collateral financing arrangements; and (iii) investments pledged in support of derivatives. 
  Liquid assets held in non-U.S. holding companies are generated in part through dividends from non-U.S. insurance operations. Such dividends are subject to local insurance regulatory requirements, as discussed in    Liquidity and Capital Sources   Dividends from Subsidiaries.  The cumulative earnings of certain active non-U.S. operations have been reinvested indefinitely in such non-U.S. operations, as described in Note   19   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under current tax laws, should we repatriate such earnings, we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.

   Dividends from Subsidiaries 
  MetLife, Inc. relies, in part, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles. The dividend limitation for U.S. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes. 
  The table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid by MetLife, Inc. s primary insurance subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and the respective dividends paid: 
   
 ______________ 
           (1) 
    Reflects dividend amounts that may be paid during   2016   without prior regulatory approval. However, because dividend tests may be based on dividends previously paid over rolling 12-month periods, if paid before a specified date during   2016  , some or all of such dividends may require regulatory approval. 
              (2) 
    Reflects all amounts paid, including those requiring regulatory approval. 
              (3) 
    Reflects dividend amounts that could have been paid during the relevant year without prior regulatory approval. 
              (4) 
    The New York Insurance Law was amended, permitting MLIC to pay dividends without prior regulatory approval under one of two alternative formulations beginning in 2016. See Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The dividend amount that MLIC may pay during 2016 under the new formulation is reflected in the table above. 
              (5) 
    During December 2014, MLIC distributed shares of an affiliate to MetLife, Inc. as an in-kind dividend of $113 million. 
              (6) 
    See  Business   Overview   Other Key Information  for discussion of the Mergers. MetLife Investors Insurance Company was one of the companies that was merged into MetLife USA in connection with the Mergers. Prior to the Mergers, Exeter paid dividends of $155 million on its preferred stock. In August 2014, MICC redeemed for $1.4 billion and retired 4,595,317 shares of its common stock owned by MetLife Investors Group, LLC ( MLIG ). Following the redemption, in August 2014, MLIG paid a dividend of $1.4 billion to MetLife, Inc. See    Liquidity and Capital Uses   Affiliated Capital Transactions.  MetLife USA did not pay dividends in 2014.  
               (8) 
    During October 2013, Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company ( MTL ) distributed shares of an affiliate to MetLife, Inc. as an in-kind dividend of $32 million. Also during October 2013, MTL paid a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in the amount of $77 million in cash, which represented its dividend capacity without regulatory approval at December 31, 2013. Regulatory approval for these dividends was obtained due to the amount and timing of the payments.

       Table of Contents  

   In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , cash dividends in the aggregate amount of $9 million, $17 million and $0, respectively, were paid to MetLife, Inc. by certain of its other subsidiaries. Additionally, for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , MetLife, Inc. received cash of $5 million, $0 and $267 million, respectively, representing returns of capital from certain subsidiaries. 
  The dividend capacity of our non-U.S. operations is subject to similar restrictions established by the local regulators. The non-U.S. regulatory regimes also commonly limit the dividend payments to the parent to a portion of the prior year s statutory income, as determined by the local accounting principles. The regulators of our non-U.S. operations, including the FSA, may also limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers are deemed to be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the non-U.S. operations, or for other reasons. Most of the non-U.S. subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries which are owned by various non-U.S. holding companies. The capital and rating considerations applicable to the first tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow into MetLife, Inc. 
  We actively manage target and excess capital levels and dividend flows on a proactive basis and forecast local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle. The dividend capacity of certain U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of financial strength in the relevant market. We cannot provide assurance that MetLife, Inc. s subsidiaries will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to MetLife, Inc. in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends and that the applicable regulators will not disapprove any dividends that such subsidiaries must submit for approval.

Depends on the Ability of Its Subsidiaries to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow  and Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures

    The Company uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in discretionary capital actions. The Company defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at MetLife s holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries, expenses and other net flows of the holding companies, and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios. This measure of free cash flow is prior to discretionary capital deployment, including common stock dividends and repurchases, debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions. Free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP. The free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual operating earnings available to common shareholders. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities of MetLife, Inc. to free cash flow of all holding companies for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is provided below.

  (1) Consolidated operating earnings available to common shareholders for 2015 includes a non-cash charge of $792 million, net of income tax, related to an uncertain tax position. Excluding this charge from the denominator of the ratio, the adjusted free cash flow ratio would be 63%. See  Risk Factors     Regulatory and Legal Risks   Changes in Tax Laws or Interpretations of Such Laws Could Reduce Our Earnings and Materially Impact Our Operations by Increasing Our Corporate Taxes and Making Some of Our Products Less Attractive to Consumers  for additional information on this non-cash charge. 
  (2) Consolidated net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders for 2015 includes a non-cash charge of $792 million, net of income tax, related to an uncertain tax position. Excluding this charge from the denominator of the ratio, this ratio, as adjusted, would be 27%. 
  (3) Including the free cash flow of other MetLife, Inc. holding companies of $461 million, $228 million and $134 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in the numerator of the ratio, this ratio, as adjusted, would be 40%, 46% and 62%, respectively.

   Finally, in this discussion, we also provide forward-looking guidance on an operating, or non-GAAP, basis. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.

    Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    Risk Management 
  We have developed an integrated process for managing risk, which we conduct through multiple Board and senior management committees (financial and non-financial) within the GRM, ALM Unit, Treasury Department and Investments Department. The risk committee structure is designed to provide a consolidated enterprise-wide assessment and management of risk. The ERC is responsible for reviewing all material risks to the enterprise and deciding on actions, if necessary, in the event risks exceed desired tolerances, taking into consideration industry best practices and the current environment to resolve or mitigate those risks. Additional committees at the MetLife, Inc. and subsidiary insurance company level that manage capital and risk positions, approve ALM strategies and establish corporate business standards, report to the ERC.  
    Global Risk Management 
  Independent from the lines of business, the centralized GRM, led by the CRO, collaborates and coordinates across all committees to ensure that all material risks are properly identified, measured, aggregated and reported across the Company. The CRO reports to the CEO and is primarily responsible for maintaining and communicating the Company s enterprise risk policies and for monitoring and analyzing all material risks. 
  GRM considers and monitors a full range of risks against the Company s solvency, liquidity, earnings, business operations and reputation. GRM s primary responsibilities consist of: 
             
    implementing a corporate risk framework, which outlines our enterprise approach for managing risk; 
                
    developing policies and procedures for managing, measuring, monitoring and controlling those risks identified in the corporate risk framework; 
                
    establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels; 
                
    deploying capital on an economic basis; 
                
    recommending capital allocations on an economic capital basis; and 
                
    reporting to (i) the Finance and Risk Committee of MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors; (ii) the Investment Committee of MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors; and (iii) the financial and non-financial senior management committees on various aspects of risk. 
       Asset/Liability Management 
  We actively manage our assets using an approach that balances quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity, concentration and investment return. The goals of the investment process are to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are reasonably managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The ALM process is the shared responsibility of the ALM Unit, GRM, the Portfolio Management Unit, and the senior members of the business segments and is governed by the ALM Committees. The ALM Committees  duties include reviewing and approving target portfolios, establishing investment guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the ALM process on a periodic basis. The directives of the ALM Committees are carried out and monitored through ALM Working Groups which are set up to manage by product type. Generally, our ALM Steering Committee oversees the activities of the underlying ALM Committees. The ALM Steering Committee reports to the ERC. 
  We establish target asset portfolios for each major insurance product, which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund our liabilities within acceptable levels of risk. The ALM Working Groups monitor these strategies through regular review of portfolio metrics, such as effective duration, yield curve sensitivity, convexity, liquidity, asset sector concentration and credit quality.

       Table of Contents  

   Market Risk Exposures 
  We regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate, equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate risks. As a result of that analysis, we have determined that the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are materially exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the equity markets. We have exposure to market risk through our insurance operations and investment activities. For purposes of this disclosure,  market risk  is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets. 
    Interest Rates 
  Our exposure to interest rate changes results most significantly from our holdings of fixed maturity securities, as well as our interest rate sensitive liabilities. The fixed maturity securities include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and ABS, all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium- and long-term interest rates. The interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include debt, policyholder account balances related to certain investment type contracts, and net embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits which have the same type of interest rate exposure (medium- and long-term interest rates) as fixed maturity securities. We employ product design, pricing and ALM strategies to reduce the potential effects of interest rate movements. Product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products and the ability to reset crediting rates for certain products. ALM strategies include the use of derivatives and duration mismatch limits. See  Risk Factors   Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks   We Are Exposed to Significant Global Financial and Capital Markets Risks Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and May Cause Our Net Investment Income to Vary from Period to Period.  
    Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
  Our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar results from our holdings in non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturity and equity securities, mortgage loans, and certain liabilities, as well as through our investments in foreign subsidiaries. The principal currencies that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in our investment portfolios and liabilities are the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Selectively, we use U.S. dollar assets to support certain long duration foreign currency liabilities. Through our investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures, we are primarily exposed to the Japanese yen, the Euro, the Polish zloty, the Australian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Chilean peso and the Korean won. In addition to hedging with foreign currency swaps, forwards and options, local surplus in some countries is held entirely or in part in U.S. dollar assets which further minimizes exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk. We have matched much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. See  Risk Factors   Risks Related to Our Business   Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability.  
    Equity Market 
  Along with investments in equity securities, we have exposure to equity market risk through certain liabilities that involve long-term guarantees on equity performance such as net embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits and certain policyholder account balances. We manage this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through our ALM strategies, including the dynamic hedging of certain variable annuity guarantee benefits, as well as reinsurance, in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to large risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. We also manage equity market risk exposure in our investment portfolio through the use of derivatives. Equity exposures associated with other limited partnership interests are excluded from this discussion as they are not considered financial instruments under GAAP. 
    Management of Market Risk Exposures 
  We use a variety of strategies to manage interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market risk, including the use of derivatives. 
    178 

       Table of Contents  

   Interest Rate Risk Management 
  To manage interest rate risk, we analyze interest rate risk using various models, including multi-scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments, including derivatives. These projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of our in-force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments. The Department of Financial Services regulations require that we perform some of these analyses annually as part of our review of the sufficiency of our regulatory reserves. For several of our legal entities, we maintain segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of ALM and the allocation of investment income to product lines. For each segment, invested assets greater than or equal to the GAAP liabilities and any non-invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained, with any excess allocated to Corporate   Other. The business segments may reflect differences in legal entity, statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration, liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets. Certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities. We measure relative sensitivities of the value of our assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing internal models. These models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse, mortality and interest crediting rates. In addition, these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments, sinking fund payments, principal payments, bond calls, mortgage loan prepayments and defaults. 
  Common industry metrics, such as duration and convexity, are also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates. In computing the duration of liabilities, consideration is given to all policyholder guarantees and to how we intend to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends. Each asset portfolio has a duration target based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio. Where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets, as is the case with certain retirement and group products, we may support such liabilities with equity investments, derivatives or interest rate curve mismatch strategies. 
    Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Management 
  We assume foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily in three ways: investments in foreign subsidiaries, purchases of foreign currency denominated investments and the sale of certain insurance products. 
             
    The GRM s Foreign Exchange Committee, in coordination with the Treasury Department, is responsible for managing our exposure to investments in foreign subsidiaries. Exposure limits are established by the Treasury Department and monitored by GRM. The Investments Department manages such exposure. 
                
    The Investments Department is responsible for managing the exposure to foreign currency denominated investments. Exposure limits to unhedged foreign currency investments are incorporated into the standing authorizations granted to management by the Board of Directors and are reported to the Board of Directors on a periodic basis. 
                
    Management of each of the Company s segments, with oversight from the Foreign Exchange Committee, is responsible for establishing limits and managing any foreign currency exchange rate exposure caused by the sale or issuance of insurance products. 
     We use foreign currency swaps, forwards and options to mitigate the liability exposure, risk of loss and financial statement volatility associated with our investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and the sale of certain insurance products. 
    Equity Market Risk Management 
  The issuance of variable annuities exposes us to market risk. This risk is managed by our ALM Unit in partnership with the Investments Department. Equity market risk is also assumed through our investment in equity securities and is managed by our Investments Department. We use derivatives to mitigate our equity exposure both in certain liability guarantees such as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefit and equity securities. These derivatives include exchange-traded equity futures, equity index options contracts and equity variance swaps. We also employ reinsurance to manage these exposures. 
    179 

       Table of Contents  

   Hedging Activities 
  We use derivative contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and equity market risk. Derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while considering their impact on accounting results and GAAP and statutory capital. Our derivative hedge programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged. Some hedge programs are asset or liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce risk related to a group of liabilities or assets. Our use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as follows: 
             
    Risks Related to Living Guarantee Benefits   We use a wide range of derivative contracts to mitigate the risk associated with variable annuity living guarantee benefits. These derivatives include equity and interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, currency futures/forwards, equity indexed options and interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps. 
                
    Minimum Interest Rate Guarantees   For certain liability contracts, we provide the contractholder a guaranteed minimum interest rate. These contracts include certain fixed annuities and other insurance liabilities. We purchase interest rate floors to reduce risk associated with these liability guarantees. 
                
    Reinvestment Risk in Long Duration Liability Contracts   Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk related to certain long duration liability contracts. Hedges include interest rate swaps and swaptions. 
                
    Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk   We use currency swaps, forwards and options to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk. These hedges primarily swap foreign currency denominated bonds, investments in foreign subsidiaries or equity market exposures to U.S. dollars. 
                
    General ALM Hedging Strategies   In the ordinary course of managing our asset/liability risks, we use interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floors and inflation swaps. These hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or inflation risk related to the existing assets or liabilities or related to expected future cash flows. 
       Risk Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis 
  We measure market risk related to our market sensitive assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates, equity market prices and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis. This analysis estimates the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest rates, equity market prices and foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that a 10% change (increase or decrease) in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term. In performing the analysis summarized below, we used market rates at December 31,   2015  . The sensitivity analysis separately calculates each of our market risk exposures (interest rate, equity market and foreign currency exchange rate) relating to our trading and non-trading assets and liabilities. We modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of our market sensitive assets and liabilities as follows: 
             
    the net present values of our interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest rates; 
                
    the U.S. dollar equivalent estimated fair values of our foreign currency exposures due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in foreign currency exchange rates; and 
                
    the estimated fair value of our equity positions due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in equity market prices. 
     The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. We cannot ensure that our actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below. Limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include: 
             
    the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis, including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgage loans; 
                
    for the derivatives that qualify as hedges, the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values; 
                
    the analysis excludes liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts and real estate holdings; and 
                
    the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the period. 
     Accordingly, we use such models as tools and not as substitutes for the experience and judgment of our management. Based on our analysis of the impact of a 10% change (increase or decrease) in market rates and prices, we have determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities from interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market exposures.

This change was primarily due to an increase of $809 million due to increases in interest rates across the U.S. Treasury curve coupled with changes in durations.

  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

   1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    Business 
   MetLife  and the  Company  refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. MetLife is a global provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. MetLife is organized into   six   segments: Retail; Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits; Corporate Benefit Funding; and Latin America (collectively, the  Americas  Asia; and Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ). 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to the Company s business and operations. Actual results could differ from estimates. 
  Consolidation 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as well as partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company has control, and variable interest entities ( VIEs ) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
  Certain international subsidiaries have a fiscal year cutoff of November 30th. Accordingly, the Company s consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries as of November 30,   2015   and   2014   and the operating results of such subsidiaries for the years ended November 30,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . 
  Discontinued Operations 
  The results of operations of a component of the Company that has either been disposed of or is classified as held-for-sale are reported in discontinued operations if certain criteria are met. Effective January 1, 2014, the Company adopted new guidance regarding reporting of discontinued operations for disposals or classifications as held-for-sale that have not been previously reported in the consolidated financial statements. A disposal of a component is reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. See    Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements.  
  Separate Accounts 
  Separate accounts are established in conformity with insurance laws. Generally, the assets of the separate accounts cannot be used to settle the liabilities that arise from any other business of the Company. Separate account assets are subject to general account claims only to the extent the value of such assets exceeds the separate account liabilities. The Company reports separately, as assets and liabilities, investments held in separate accounts and liabilities of the separate accounts if: 
             
    such separate accounts are legally recognized; 
                
    assets supporting the contract liabilities are legally insulated from the Company s general account liabilities; 
                
    investments are directed by the contractholder; and 
                
    all investment performance, net of contract fees and assessments, is passed through to the contractholder. 
     The Company reports separate account assets at their fair value which is based on the estimated fair values of the underlying assets comprising the individual separate account portfolios. Investment performance (including investment income, net investment gains (losses) and changes in unrealized gains (losses)) and the corresponding amounts credited to contractholders of such separate accounts are offset within the same line in the statements of operations. Separate accounts credited with a contractual investment return are combined on a line-by-line basis with the Company s general account assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the accounting for these investments is consistent with the methodologies described herein for similar financial instruments held within the general account. Unit-linked separate account investments that are directed by contractholders but do not meet one or more of the other above criteria are included in fair value option ( FVO ) and trading securities.

Insurance 
  Future Policy Benefit Liabilities and Policyholder Account Balances 
  The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies. Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. For long duration insurance contracts, assumptions such as mortality, morbidity and interest rates are  locked in  upon the issuance of new business. However, significant adverse changes in experience on such contracts may require the establishment of premium deficiency reserves. Such reserves are determined based on the then current assumptions and do not include a provision for adverse deviation. 
  Premium deficiency reserves may also be established for short duration contracts to provide for expected future losses. These reserves are based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period, including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported. The provisions for unreported claims are calculated using studies that measure the historical length of time between the incurred date of a claim and its eventual reporting to the Company. Anticipated investment income is considered in the calculation of premium deficiency losses for short duration contracts.

  1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

   Liabilities for universal and variable life policies with secondary guarantees ( ULSG ) and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs ( DAC ), and are thus subject to the same variability and risk as further discussed herein. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of appropriate underlying equity indices, such as the Standard   Poor s Ratings Services ( S P ) 500 Index. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios. 
  The Company regularly reviews its estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with its actual experience. Differences result in changes to the liability balances with related charges or credits to benefit expenses in the period in which the changes occur. 
  Policyholder account balances relate to contract or contract features where the Company has no significant insurance risk. 
  The Company issues directly and assumes through reinsurance certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the benefit base) less withdrawals. These guarantees are accounted for as insurance liabilities or as embedded derivatives depending on how and when the benefit is paid. Specifically, a guarantee is accounted for as an embedded derivative if a guarantee is paid without requiring (i) the occurrence of specific insurable event, or (ii) the policyholder to annuitize. Alternatively, a guarantee is accounted for as an insurance liability if the guarantee is paid only upon either (i) the occurrence of a specific insurable event, or (ii) annuitization. In certain cases, a guarantee may have elements of both an insurance liability and an embedded derivative and in such cases the guarantee is split and accounted for under both models. 
  Guarantees accounted for as insurance liabilities in future policy benefits include guaranteed minimum death benefits ( GMDBs ), the portion of guaranteed minimum income benefits ( GMIBs ) that require annuitization, and the life-contingent portion of guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ( GMWBs ). 
  Guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives in policyholder account balances include the non life-contingent portion of GMWBs, guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ( GMABs ) and the portion of GMIBs that do not require annuitization. At inception, the Company attributes to the embedded derivative a portion of the projected future guarantee fees to be collected from the policyholder equal to the present value of projected future guaranteed benefits. Any additional fees represent  excess  fees and are reported in universal life and investment-type product policy fees. 
  Other Policy-Related Balances 
  Other policy-related balances include policy and contract claims, unearned revenue liabilities, premiums received in advance, policyholder dividends due and unpaid, policyholder dividends left on deposit and negative value of business acquired. 
  The liability for policy and contract claims generally relates to incurred but not reported death, disability, long-term care and dental claims, as well as claims which have been reported but not yet settled. The liability for these claims is based on the Company s estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims. The Company derives estimates for the development of incurred but not reported claims principally from analyses of historical patterns of claims by business line. The methods used to determine these estimates are continually reviewed. Adjustments resulting from this continuous review process and differences between estimates and payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits and claims expense in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made. 
  The unearned revenue liability relates to universal life-type and investment-type products and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. The charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the product s estimated gross profits and margins, similar to DAC as discussed further herein. Such amortization is recorded in universal life and investment-type product policy fees. 
  The Company accounts for the prepayment of premiums on its individual life, group life and health contracts as premiums received in advance and applies the cash received to premiums when due. 
  See    Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, Value of Business Acquired and Other Intangibles  for a discussion of negative value of business acquired.

   Recognition of Insurance Revenues and Deposits 
  Premiums related to traditional life, annuity contracts with life contingencies, long-duration accident   health, and credit insurance policies are recognized as revenues when due from policyholders. Policyholder benefits and expenses are provided to recognize profits over the estimated lives of the insurance policies. When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, any excess profit is deferred and recognized into earnings in a constant relationship to insurance in-force or, for annuities, the amount of expected future policy benefit payments. 
  Premiums related to short-duration non-medical health and disability, accident   health, and certain credit insurance contracts are recognized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term. 
  Deposits related to universal life-type and investment-type products are credited to policyholder account balances. Revenues from such contracts consist of fees for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges and are recorded in universal life and investment-type product policy fees in the period in which services are provided. Amounts that are charged to earnings include interest credited and benefit claims incurred in excess of related policyholder account balances. 
  Premiums related to property   casualty contracts are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term. Unearned premiums, representing the portion of premium written related to the unexpired coverage, are also included in future policy benefits. 
  Premiums, policy fees, policyholder benefits and expenses are presented net of reinsurance. 
  Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, Value of Business Acquired and Other Intangibles 
  The Company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are capitalized as DAC. Such costs include: 
             
    incremental direct costs of contract acquisition, such as commissions; 
                
    the portion of an employee s total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed; 
                
    other essential direct costs that would not have been incurred had a policy not been acquired or renewed; and 
                
    the costs of direct-response advertising, the primary purpose of which is to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and that results in probable future benefits. 
     All other acquisition-related costs, including those related to general advertising and solicitation, market research, agent training, product development, unsuccessful sales and underwriting efforts, as well as all indirect costs, are expensed as incurred. 
  Value of business acquired ( VOBA ) is an intangible asset resulting from a business combination that represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in-force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections.

     Table of Contents

  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

   DAC and VOBA are amortized as follows: 
                         Products: 
    In proportion to the following over estimated lives of the contracts: 
        
    Nonparticipating and non-dividend-paying traditional contracts: 
      
    Actual and expected future gross premiums. 

Term insurance 

Nonparticipating whole life insurance 

Traditional group life insurance 

Non-medical health insurance 

Accident   health insurance 

Participating, dividend-paying traditional contracts 
      
    Actual and expected future gross margins. 
        
    Fixed and variable universal life contracts 
      
    Actual and expected future gross profits. 
        
    Fixed and variable deferred annuity contracts 

Credit insurance contracts 
      
    Actual and future earned premiums. 
        
    Property   casualty insurance contracts 

Other short-duration contracts 

See Note   5   for additional information on DAC and VOBA amortization. Amortization of DAC and VOBA is included in other expenses. 
  The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business. DAC and VOBA are aggregated in the financial statements for reporting purposes. 
  The Company generally has two different types of sales inducements which are included in other assets: (i) the policyholder receives a bonus whereby the policyholder s initial account balance is increased by an amount equal to a specified percentage of the customer s deposit; and (ii) the policyholder receives a higher interest rate using a dollar cost averaging method than would have been received based on the normal general account interest rate credited. The Company defers sales inducements and amortizes them over the life of the policy using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC. The amortization of sales inducements is included in policyholder benefits and claims. Each year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential recoverability issue exists, the Company reviews deferred sales inducements ( DSI ) to determine the recoverability of the asset. 
  Value of distribution agreements acquired ( VODA ) is reported in other assets and represents the present value of expected future profits associated with the expected future business derived from the distribution agreements acquired as part of a business combination. Value of customer relationships acquired ( VOCRA ) is also reported in other assets and represents the present value of the expected future profits associated with the expected future business acquired through existing customers of the acquired company or business. The VODA and VOCRA associated with past business combinations are amortized over useful lives ranging from   10   to   40 years   and such amortization is included in other expenses. Each year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment exists, the Company reviews VODA and VOCRA to determine whether the asset is impaired. 
  For certain acquired blocks of business, the estimated fair value of the in-force contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed in-force insurance policy liabilities, resulting in negative VOBA, which is presented separately from VOBA as an additional insurance liability. The fair value of the in-force contract obligations is based on projections by each block of business. Negative VOBA is amortized over the policy period in proportion to the approximate consumption of losses included in the liability usually expressed in terms of insurance in-force or account value. Such amortization is recorded as a contra-expense in other expenses. 
  Reinsurance 
  For each of its reinsurance agreements, the Company determines whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Cessions under reinsurance agreements do not discharge the Company s obligations as the primary insurer. The Company reviews all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. 
    199 

     Table of Contents  
  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

   For reinsurance of existing in-force blocks of long-duration contracts that transfer significant insurance risk, the difference, if any, between the amounts paid (received), and the liabilities ceded (assumed) related to the underlying contracts is considered the net cost of reinsurance at the inception of the reinsurance agreement. The net cost of reinsurance is recorded as an adjustment to DAC and recognized as a component of other expenses on a basis consistent with the way the acquisition costs on the underlying reinsured contracts would be recognized. Subsequent amounts paid (received) on the reinsurance of in-force blocks, as well as amounts paid (received) related to new business, are recorded as ceded (assumed) premiums; and ceded (assumed) premiums, reinsurance and other receivables (future policy benefits) are established. 
  For prospective reinsurance of short-duration contracts that meet the criteria for reinsurance accounting, amounts paid (received) are recorded as ceded (assumed) premiums and ceded (assumed) unearned premiums. Unearned premiums are reflected as a component of premiums, reinsurance and other receivables (future policy benefits). Such amounts are amortized through earned premiums over the remaining contract period in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. For retroactive reinsurance of short-duration contracts that meet the criteria of reinsurance accounting, amounts paid (received) in excess of the related insurance liabilities ceded (assumed) are recognized immediately as a loss and are reported in the appropriate line item within the statement of operations. Any gain on such retroactive agreement is deferred and is amortized as part of DAC, primarily using the recovery method. 
  Amounts currently recoverable under reinsurance agreements are included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables and amounts currently payable are included in other liabilities. Assets and liabilities relating to reinsurance agreements with the same reinsurer may be recorded net on the balance sheet, if a right of offset exists within the reinsurance agreement. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations to the Company under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible. In such instances, reinsurance recoverable balances are stated net of allowances for uncollectible reinsurance. 
  Premiums, fees and policyholder benefits and claims include amounts assumed under reinsurance agreements and are net of reinsurance ceded. Amounts received from reinsurers for policy administration are reported in other revenues. With respect to GMIBs, a portion of the directly written GMIBs are accounted for as insurance liabilities, but the associated reinsurance agreements contain embedded derivatives. These embedded derivatives are included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables with changes in estimated fair value reported in policyholder benefits and claims. 
  If the Company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the agreement using the deposit method of accounting. Deposits received are included in other liabilities and deposits made are included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables. As amounts are paid or received, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit assets or liabilities are adjusted. Interest on such deposits is recorded as other revenues or other expenses, as appropriate. Periodically, the Company evaluates the adequacy of the expected payments or recoveries and adjusts the deposit asset or liability through other revenues or other expenses, as appropriate. 
  Investments 
  Net Investment Income and Net Investment Gains (Losses) 
  Income from investments is reported within net investment income, unless otherwise stated herein. Gains and losses on sales of investments, impairment losses and changes in valuation allowances are reported within net investment gains (losses), unless otherwise stated herein. 
  Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities 
  The majority of the Company s fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale ( AFS ) and are reported at their estimated fair value. Unrealized investment gains and losses on these securities are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ), net of policy-related amounts and deferred income taxes. All security transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Investment gains and losses on sales are determined on a specific identification basis. 
  Interest income and prepayment fees are recognized when earned. Interest income is recognized using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Dividends on equity securities are recognized when declared.

     Table of Contents  
  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

   The Company periodically evaluates fixed maturity and equity securities for impairment. The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management s case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value, as well as an analysis of the gross unrealized losses by severity and/or age as described in Note 8    Evaluation of AFS Securities for OTTI and Evaluating Temporarily Impaired AFS Securities.  
  For fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position, an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) is recognized in earnings when it is anticipated that the amortized cost will not be recovered. When either: (i) the Company has the intent to sell the security; or (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery, the OTTI recognized in earnings is the entire difference between the security s amortized cost and estimated fair value. If neither of these conditions exists, the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of projected future cash flows expected to be collected is recognized as an OTTI in earnings ( credit loss ). If the estimated fair value is less than the present value of projected future cash flows expected to be collected, this portion of OTTI related to other-than-credit factors ( noncredit loss ) is recorded in OCI. 
  With respect to equity securities, the Company considers in its OTTI analysis its intent and ability to hold a particular equity security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its estimated fair value to an amount equal to or greater than cost. If a sale decision is made for an equity security and recovery to an amount at least equal to cost prior to the sale is not expected, the security will be deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired in the period that the sale decision was made and an OTTI loss will be recorded in earnings. The OTTI loss recognized is the entire difference between the security s cost and its estimated fair value. 
  FVO and Trading Securities 
  FVO and trading securities are stated at estimated fair value and include investments for which the FVO has been elected ( FVO Securities ) and investments that are actively purchased and sold ( Actively traded securities ). FVO Securities include: 
             
    fixed maturity and equity securities held-for-investment by the general account to support asset and liability management strategies for certain insurance products and investments in certain separate accounts ( FVO general account securities  and 
                
    contractholder-directed investments supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities which do not qualify for presentation and reporting as separate account summary total assets and liabilities. These investments are primarily mutual funds and, to a lesser extent, fixed maturity and equity securities, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents. The investment returns on these investments inure to contractholders and are offset by a corresponding change in Policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances ( FVO contractholder-directed unit-linked investments ). 
     Actively traded securities principally include fixed maturity securities and short sale agreement liabilities, which are included in other liabilities. 
  Changes in estimated fair value of these securities are included in net investment income, except for certain securities included in FVO Securities where changes are included in net investment gains (losses). 
  Mortgage Loans 
  The Company disaggregates its mortgage loan investments into three portfolio segments: commercial, agricultural and residential. The accounting policies that are applicable to all portfolio segments are presented below and the accounting policies related to each of the portfolio segments are included in Note 8. 
  Mortgage Loans Held-For-Investment 
  Mortgage loans held-for-investment are stated at unpaid principal balance, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, and are net of valuation allowances. Interest income and prepayment fees are recognized when earned. Interest income is recognized using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. 
    201 

     Table of Contents  
  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

   Also included in mortgage loans held-for-investment are commercial mortgage loans held by consolidated securitization entities ( CSEs ) and residential mortgage loans for which the FVO was elected, which are stated at estimated fair value. Changes in estimated fair value are recognized in net investment gains (losses) for commercial mortgage loans held by CSEs   FVO, and net investment income for residential mortgage loans   FVO. 
  Mortgage Loans Held-For-Sale 
  Mortgage loans held-for-sale that were previously designated as held-for-investment and mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell for which FVO was not elected, are stated at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value. 
  Policy Loans 
  Policy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances. Interest income is recorded as earned using the contractual interest rate. Generally, accrued interest is capitalized on the policy s anniversary date. Valuation allowances are not established for policy loans, as they are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of the underlying insurance policies. Any unpaid principal and accrued interest is deducted from the cash surrender value or the death benefit prior to settlement of the insurance policy. 
  Real Estate 
  Real estate held-for-investment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset (typically   20   to   55 years  ). Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases. The Company periodically reviews its real estate held-for-investment for impairment and tests for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and exceeds its estimated fair value. Properties whose carrying values are greater than their undiscounted cash flows are written down to their estimated fair value, which is generally computed using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the underlying risks. 
  Real estate for which the Company commits to a plan to sell within one year and actively markets in its current condition for a reasonable price in comparison to its estimated fair value is classified as held-for-sale. Real estate held-for-sale is stated at the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition costs and is not depreciated. 
  Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership Interests 
  The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity securities when it has significant influence or at least 20% interest and for real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests ( investees ) when it has more than a minor ownership interest or more than a minor influence over the investee s operations, but does not have a controlling financial interest. The Company generally recognizes its share of the investee s earnings on a three-month lag in instances where the investee s financial information is not sufficiently timely or when the investee s reporting period differs from the Company s reporting period.  
  The Company uses the cost method of accounting for investments in which it has virtually no influence over the investee s operations. The Company recognizes distributions on cost method investments as earned or received. Because of the nature and structure of these cost method investments, they do not meet the characteristics of an equity security in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
  The Company routinely evaluates its equity method and cost method investments for impairment. For equity method investees, the Company considers financial and other information provided by the investee, other known information and inherent risks in the underlying investments, as well as future capital commitments, in determining whether an impairment has occurred. The Company considers its cost method investments for impairment when the carrying value of such investments exceeds the net asset value ( NAV ). The Company takes into consideration the severity and duration of this excess when determining whether the cost method investment is impaired. 
  Short-term Investments 
  Short-term investments include securities and other investments with remaining maturities of one year or less, but greater than three months, at the time of purchase and are stated at estimated fair value or amortized cost, which approximates estimated fair value.

   Other Invested Assets 
  Other invested assets consist principally of the following: 
             
    Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values which are described in    Derivatives  below. 
                
    Tax credit and renewable energy partnerships which derive a significant source of investment return in the form of income tax credits or other tax incentives. Where tax credits are guaranteed by a creditworthy third party, the investment is accounted for under the effective yield method. Otherwise, the investment is accounted for under the equity method. 
                
    Leveraged leases which are recorded net of non-recourse debt. Income is recognized by applying the leveraged lease s estimated rate of return to the net investment in the lease. The Company regularly reviews residual values for impairment.  
                
    Direct financing leases gross investment is equal to the minimum lease payments plus the unguaranteed residual value.  Income is recorded by applying the pre-tax internal rate of return to the investment balance. The Company regularly reviews lease receivables for impairment. Certain direct financing leases are linked to inflation. 
                
    Funds withheld represent a receivable for amounts contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements. The Company recognizes interest on funds withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which may be contractually specified or directly related to the underlying investments. 
                
    Investments in operating joint ventures that engage in insurance underwriting activities are accounted for under the equity method. 
     Securities Lending Program 
  Securities lending transactions, whereby blocks of securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks, are treated as financing arrangements and the associated liability is recorded at the amount of cash received. The Company obtains collateral at the inception of the loan, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to   102%   of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and maintains it at a level greater than or equal to   100%   for the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. The Company is liable to return to the counterparties the cash collateral received. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected in the Company s financial statements. The Company monitors the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis and additional collateral is obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan. Income and expenses associated with securities lending transactions are reported as investment income and investment expense, respectively, within net investment income. 
  Derivatives 
  Freestanding Derivatives 
  Freestanding derivatives are carried on the Company s balance sheet either as assets within other invested assets or as liabilities within other liabilities at estimated fair value. The Company does not offset the estimated fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. 
  Accruals on derivatives are generally recorded in accrued investment income or within other liabilities. However, accruals that are not scheduled to settle within one year are included with the derivatives carrying value in other invested assets or other liabilities.

   If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge or its use in managing risk does not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative are reported in net derivative gains (losses) except as follows: 
                   Statement of Operations Presentation: 
    Derivative: 
      Policyholder benefits and claims

    Economic hedges of equity method investments in joint ventures 

All derivatives held in relation to trading portfolios 

Derivatives held within contractholder-directed unit-linked investments 

Hedge Accounting 
  To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. Hedge designation and financial statement presentation of changes in estimated fair value of the hedging derivatives are as follows: 
             
    Fair value hedge   (a hedge of the estimated fair value of a recognized asset or liability) - in net derivative gains (losses), consistent with the change in estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the designated risk being hedged. 
                
    Cash flow hedge   (a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability) - effectiveness in OCI (deferred gains or losses on the derivative are reclassified into the statement of operations when the Company s earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged item); ineffectiveness in net derivative gains (losses). 
                
    Net investment in a foreign operation hedge   - effectiveness in OCI, consistent with the translation adjustment for the hedged net investment in the foreign operation; ineffectiveness in net derivative gains (losses). 
     The changes in estimated fair values of the hedging derivatives are exclusive of any accruals that are separately reported on the statement of operations within interest income or interest expense to match the location of the hedged item. Accruals on derivatives in net investment hedges are recognized in OCI. 
  In its hedge documentation, the Company sets forth how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated risks related to the hedged item and sets forth the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging instrument s effectiveness and the method that will be used to measure ineffectiveness. A derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and at least quarterly throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness are also subject to interpretation and estimation and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income. 
  The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; (ii) the derivative expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur; or (iv) the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument. 
  When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative is not highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in net derivative gains (losses). The carrying value of the hedged recognized asset or liability under a fair value hedge is no longer adjusted for changes in its estimated fair value due to the hedged risk, and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying value is amortized into income over the remaining life of the hedged item. Provided the hedged forecasted transaction is still probable of occurrence, the changes in estimated fair value of derivatives recorded in OCI related to discontinued cash flow hedges are released into the statement of operations when the Company s earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged item.

   When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transactions will occur on the anticipated date or within two months of that date, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized currently in net derivative gains (losses). Deferred gains and losses of a derivative recorded in OCI pursuant to the discontinued cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction that is no longer probable are recognized immediately in net derivative gains (losses). 
  In all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative is carried at its estimated fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its estimated fair value recognized in the current period as net derivative gains (losses). 
  Embedded Derivatives 
  The Company sells variable annuities and issues certain insurance products and investment contracts and is a party to certain reinsurance agreements that have embedded derivatives. The Company assesses each identified embedded derivative to determine whether it is required to be bifurcated. The embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as a freestanding derivative if: 
             
    the combined instrument is not accounted for in its entirety at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value recorded in earnings; 
                
    the terms of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract; and 
                
    a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument. 
     Such embedded derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair value with the host contract and changes in their estimated fair value are generally reported in net derivative gains (losses), except for those in policyholder benefits and claims related to ceded reinsurance of GMIB. If the Company is unable to properly identify and measure an embedded derivative for separation from its host contract, the entire contract is carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in the current period in net investment gains (losses) or net investment income. Additionally, the Company may elect to carry an entire contract on the balance sheet at estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in the current period in net investment gains (losses) or net investment income if that contract contains an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation. At inception, the Company attributes to the embedded derivative a portion of the projected future guarantee fees to be collected from the policyholder equal to the present value of projected future guaranteed benefits. Any additional fees represent  excess  fees and are reported in universal life and investment-type product policy fees. 
  Fair Value 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In most cases, the exit price and the transaction (or entry) price will be the same at initial recognition. 
  Subsequent to initial recognition, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities. 
  Goodwill 
  Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from net assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and recognized. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of such net assets acquired, is not amortized, and is tested for impairment based on a fair value approach at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter of each year based upon data as of the close of the second quarter. Goodwill associated with a business acquisition is not tested for impairment during the year the business is acquired unless there is a significant identified impairment event.

     Table of Contents  
  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

   The impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, there may be an indication of impairment. In such instances, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business combination. The excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill would be recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income. 
  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates potential triggering events that may affect the estimated fair value of the Company s reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment exists. Deteriorating or adverse market conditions for certain reporting units may have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units and could result in future impairments of goodwill. 
  Employee Benefit Plans 
  Certain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. sponsor and/or administer various plans that provide defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits covering eligible employees and sales representatives. Measurement dates used for all of the subsidiaries  defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans correspond with the fiscal year ends of sponsoring subsidiaries, which are December 31 for U.S. and most non-U.S. subsidiaries and November 30 for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. 
  The Company recognizes the funded status of each of its defined pension and postretirement benefit plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation, which is the projected benefit obligation ( PBO ) for pension benefits and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ( APBO ) for other postretirement benefits in other assets or other liabilities. 
  Actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the actual experience and the assumed experience on plan assets or PBO during a particular period and are recorded in accumulated OCI ( AOCI ). To the extent such gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the PBO or the estimated fair value of plan assets, the excess is amortized into net periodic benefit costs over the average projected future service years of the active employees. In addition, prior service costs (credit) are recognized in AOCI at the time of the amendment and then amortized to net periodic benefit costs over the average projected future service years of the active employees affected by the change. 
  Net periodic benefit costs are determined using management estimates and actuarial assumptions and are comprised of service cost, interest cost, settlement and curtailment costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of net actuarial (gains) losses, and amortization of prior service costs (credit). Fair value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. 
  The subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution plans for substantially all U.S. employees under which a portion of employee contributions is matched. Applicable matching contributions are made each payroll period. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation cost for current matching contributions. As all contributions are transferred currently as earned to the defined contribution plans, no liability for matching contributions is recognized in the balance sheets. 
  Income Tax 
  MetLife, Inc. and its includable life insurance and non-life insurance subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return in accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). Non-includable subsidiaries file either separate individual corporate tax returns or separate consolidated tax returns. 
  The Company s accounting for income taxes represents management s best estimate of various events and transactions. 
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)

   The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction. Valuation allowances are established when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. When making such determination the Company considers many factors, including: 
             
    the nature, frequency, and amount of cumulative financial reporting income and losses in recent years; 
                
    the jurisdiction in which the deferred tax asset was generated; 
                
    the length of time that carryforward can be utilized in the various taxing jurisdiction; 
                
    future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; 
                
    future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; 
                
    taxable income in prior carryback years; and 
                
    tax planning strategies. 
     The Company may be required to change its provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, the effect of changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, is recognized in net income tax expense (benefit) in the period of change.  
  The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than   50%   likely of being realized upon settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits due to tax uncertainties that do not meet the threshold are included within other liabilities and are charged to earnings in the period that such determination is made. 
  The Company classifies interest recognized as interest expense and penalties recognized as a component of income tax expense. 
  Litigation Contingencies 
  The Company is a party to a number of legal actions and is involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to estimate the impact on the Company s financial position. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Except as otherwise disclosed in Note   21  , legal costs are recognized as incurred. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in the Company s financial statements. 
  Other Accounting Policies 
  Stock-Based Compensation 
  The Company grants certain employees and directors stock-based compensation awards under various plans that are subject to specific vesting conditions. With the exception of performance shares granted in 2015, 2014 and 2013 which are re-measured quarterly, the cost of all stock-based transactions is measured at fair value at grant date and recognized over the period during which a grantee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. Although the terms of the Company s stock-based plans do not accelerate vesting upon retirement, or the attainment of retirement eligibility, the requisite service period subsequent to attaining such eligibility is considered non-substantive. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense related to stock-based awards over the shorter of the requisite service period or the period to attainment of retirement eligibility. An estimation of future forfeitures of stock-based awards is incorporated into the determination of compensation expense when recognizing expense over the requisite service period. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company considers all highly liquid securities and other investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at amortized cost, which approximates estimated fair value.

   Property, Equipment, Leasehold Improvements and Computer Software 
  Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, which are included in other assets, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as appropriate. The estimated life is generally   40 years   for company occupied real estate property, from   one   to   25 years   for leasehold improvements, and from   three   to   seven years   for all other property and equipment. The cost basis of the property, equipment and leasehold improvements was   $2.0 billion   at both December 31,   2015   and   2014  . Accumulated depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements was   $1.1 billion   and   $1.0 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Related depreciation and amortization expense was   $216 million  ,   $182 million   and   $183 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  Computer software, which is included in other assets, is stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Purchased software costs, as well as certain internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use computer software during the application development stage, are capitalized. Such costs are amortized generally over a   four  -year period using the straight-line method. The cost basis of computer software was   $2.2 billion   and   $1.9 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized software was   $1.5 billion   and   $1.3 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Related amortization expense was   $212 million  ,   $212 million   and   $216 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  Other Revenues 
  Other revenues include, in addition to items described elsewhere herein, advisory fees, broker-dealer commissions and fees, administrative service fees, and changes in account value relating to corporate-owned life insurance ( COLI ). Such fees and commissions are recognized in the period in which services are performed. Under certain COLI contracts, if the Company reports certain unlikely adverse results in its financial statements, withdrawals would not be immediately available and would be subject to market value adjustment, which could result in a reduction of the account value. 
  Policyholder Dividends 
  Policyholder dividends are approved annually by the insurance subsidiaries  boards of directors. The aggregate amount of policyholder dividends is related to actual interest, mortality, morbidity and expense experience for the year, as well as management s judgment as to the appropriate level of statutory surplus to be retained by the insurance subsidiaries. 
  Foreign Currency 
  Assets, liabilities and operations of foreign affiliates and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. The determination of the functional currency is made based on the appropriate economic and management indicators.   For most of the Company s foreign operations, the local currency is the functional currency. For certain other foreign operations, such as Japan, the local currency and one or more other currencies qualify as functional currencies.   Assets and liabilities of foreign affiliates and subsidiaries are translated from the functional currency to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at each year-end and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited directly to OCI, net of applicable taxes. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, including the effect of re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities to the appropriate functional currency, are reported as part of net investment gains (losses) in the period in which they occur. 
  Earnings Per Common Share 
  Basic earnings per common share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares, or their equivalent, outstanding during the period. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Diluted earnings per common share include the dilutive effect of the assumed: (i) exercise or issuance of stock-based awards using the treasury stock method; (ii) settlement of stock purchase contracts underlying common equity units using the treasury stock method; and (iii) settlement of accelerated common stock repurchase contracts. Under the treasury stock method, exercise or issuance of stock-based awards and settlement of stock purchase contracts underlying common equity units is assumed to occur with the proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period.

   Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements 
  Effective November 18, 2014, the Company adopted new guidance on when, if ever, the cost of acquiring an entity should be used to establish a new accounting basis ( pushdown ) in the acquired entity s separate financial statements. The guidance provides an acquired entity and its subsidiaries with an irrevocable option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. If a reporting entity elects to apply pushdown accounting, its stand-alone financial statements would reflect the acquirer s new basis in the acquired entity s assets and liabilities. The election to apply pushdown accounting should be determined by an acquired entity for each individual change-in-control event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity; however, an entity that does not elect to apply pushdown accounting in the period of a change-in-control can later elect to retrospectively apply pushdown accounting to the most recent change-in-control transaction as a change in accounting principle. The new guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  Effective January 1, 2014, the Company adopted new guidance regarding reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. The guidance increases the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation, expands the disclosures for discontinued operations and requires new disclosures for certain disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. Disposals must now represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the entity s operations and financial results to qualify as discontinued operations. 
  Effective January 1, 2014, the Company adopted new guidance regarding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit. The new guidance requires that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. However, when the carryforwards are not available at the reporting date to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the applicable tax law does not require, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit will be presented in the financial statements as a liability and will not be combined with the related deferred tax asset. The adoption was prospectively applied and resulted in a reduction to other liabilities and a corresponding increase to deferred income tax liability in the amount of   $277 million  . 
  Effective January 1, 2014, the Company adopted new guidance on other expenses. The objective of this standard is to address how health insurers should recognize and classify in their income statements fees mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. The amendments in this standard specify that the liability for the fee should be estimated and recorded in full once the entity provides qualifying health insurance in the applicable calendar year in which the fee is payable with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense using the straight-line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable. In accordance with the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement on January 1, 2014, the Company recorded   $57 million   in other liabilities, and a corresponding deferred cost, in other assets. 
  Effective July 17, 2013, the Company adopted guidance regarding derivatives that permits the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (or Overnight Index Swap Rate) to be used as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes, in addition to the United States Treasury and London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ). Also, this new guidance removes the restriction on using different benchmark rates for similar hedges. The new guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  Effective January 1, 2013, the Company adopted guidance regarding comprehensive income that requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of AOCI by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For other amounts that are not required under GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. The adoption was prospectively applied and resulted in additional disclosures in Note 16.

   Effective January 1, 2013, the Company adopted guidance regarding balance sheet offsetting disclosures which requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements for derivatives, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions, to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effects of those arrangements on its financial position. Entities are required to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. The adoption was retrospectively applied and resulted in additional disclosures related to derivatives in Note 9. 
  Future Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance (Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-01,     Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ) on the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for the instrument-specific credit risk provision. The new guidance changes the current accounting guidance related to (i) the classification and measurement of certain equity investments, (ii) the presentation of changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the FVO that are due to instrument-specific credit risk, and (iii) certain disclosures associated with the fair value of financial instruments.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on short-duration insurance contracts (ASU 2015-09,     Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts  ). The amendments in this new guidance are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new guidance should be applied retrospectively by providing comparative disclosures for each period presented, except for those requirements that apply only to the current period. The new guidance requires insurance entities to provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about initial claim estimates and subsequent adjustments to these estimates, including information on: (i) reconciling from the claim development table to the balance sheet liability, (ii) methodologies and judgments in estimating claims, and (iii) the timing, and frequency of claims. The adoption will not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements other than expanded disclosures in Note 4.    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on fair value measurement (ASU 2015 07,     Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share   (  or Its Equivalent  )  ), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years and which should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments in this ASU remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. In addition, the amendments remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient. The adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement (ASU 2015-05,     Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  ), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the new guidance is permitted and an entity can elect to adopt the guidance either: (1) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date; or (2) retrospectively. The new guidance provides that all software licenses included in cloud computing arrangements be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. However, if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract, the accounting for which did not change. The adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued certain amendments to the consolidation analysis to improve consolidation guidance for legal entities (ASU 2015-02,     Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  ), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. The new standard is intended to improve targeted areas of the consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures. The amendments in this ASU affect the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations. In addition, the amendments in this ASU simplify and improve current GAAP by reducing the number of consolidation models. The adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

   In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard (ASU 2014 09,     Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years and should be applied retrospectively. In August 2015, the FASB amended the guidance to defer the effective date by one year, effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The new guidance will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP; however, it will not impact the accounting for insurance contracts, leases, financial instruments and guarantees. For those contracts that are impacted by the new guidance, the guidance will require an entity to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    2. Segment Information 
    MetLife is organized into   six   segments, reflecting three broad geographic regions: Retail; Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits; Corporate Benefit Funding; and Latin America (collectively, the  Americas  Asia; and EMEA.

  Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies 
  Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss the Company uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is the Company s measure of segment performance and is reported below. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax. The Company believes the presentation of operating earnings as the Company measures it for management purposes enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. 
  Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. 
  Operating revenues and operating expenses exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife and are referred to as divested businesses. Operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses). Operating expenses also excludes goodwill impairments.

     Operating earnings also excludes the recognition of certain contingent assets and liabilities that could not be recognized at acquisition or adjusted for during the measurement period under GAAP business combination accounting guidance. In addition to the tax impact of the adjustments mentioned above, provision for income tax expense (benefit) also includes the impact related to the timing of certain tax credits, as well as certain tax reforms.  
  Set forth in the tables below is certain financial information with respect to the Company s segments, as well as Corporate   Other, for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   and at December 31,   2015   and   2014  . The segment accounting policies are the same as those used to prepare the Company s consolidated financial statements, except for operating earnings adjustments as defined above. In addition, segment accounting policies include the method of capital allocation described below. 
  Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in the Company s business.

  2. Segment Information (continued) 

   The Company s economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. The Company s management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards. 
  Segment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact the Company s consolidated net investment income, operating earnings or income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax. 
  Net investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment s specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company s product pricing.

    3. Acquisitions and Dispositions 
    2014 Disposition 
  In May 2014, the Company completed the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary, MetLife Assurance Limited ( MAL ), for   $702 million   (   418 million  ) in net cash consideration. As a result of the sale, a loss of   $633 million   (  $442 million  , net of income tax), was recorded for the year ended   December 31, 2014  , which includes a reduction to goodwill of   $60 million   (  $51 million  , net of income tax), as well as   $77 million   (  $50 million  , net of income tax) related to net investments in foreign operation hedges. The loss is reflected within net investment gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Compared to the expected loss at the time of the sales agreement, the actual loss on the sale was increased by net income from MAL of   $77 million   for the year ended   December 31, 2014  . MAL s results of operations are included in continuing operations. They were historically included in the Corporate Benefit Funding segment. 
  2013 Acquisition

   4. Insurance 
    Insurance Liabilities 
  Insurance liabilities are comprised of future policy benefits, policyholder account balances and other policy-related balances. Information regarding insurance liabilities by segment, as well as Corporate   Other, was as follows at: 

Future policy benefits are measured as follows: 
                 Product Type: 
    Measurement Assumptions: 
      Participating life 
    Aggregate of (i) net level premium reserves for death and endowment policy benefits (calculated based upon the non-forfeiture interest rate, ranging from 3% to 7% for domestic business and 1% to 11% for international business and mortality rates guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in such contracts); and (ii) the liability for terminal dividends for domestic business. 
      Nonparticipating life 
    Aggregate of the present value of expected future benefit payments and related expenses less the present value of expected future net premiums. Assumptions as to mortality and persistency are based upon the Company s experience when the basis of the liability is established. Interest rate assumptions for the aggregate future policy benefit liabilities range from 2% to 11% for domestic business and less than 1% to 13% for international business. 
      I  ndividual and group 
  traditional fixed annuities 
  after annuitization 
    Present value of expected future payments. Interest rate assumptions used in establishing such liabilities range from 2% to 11% for domestic business and less than 1% to 12% for international business. 
      Non-medical health 
  insurance 
    The net level premium method and assumptions as to future morbidity, withdrawals and interest, which provide a margin for adverse deviation. Interest rate assumptions used in establishing such liabilities range from 4% to 7% (primarily related to domestic business). 
      Disabled lives 
    Present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest. Interest rate assumptions used in establishing such liabilities range from 2% to 8% for domestic business and 1% to 9% for international business. 
      Property   casualty 
  insurance 
    The amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported are based upon the Company s historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation. 

Participating business represented   4%   and   5%   of the Company s life insurance in-force at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Participating policies represented   19%  ,   18%   and   19%   of gross traditional life insurance premiums for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  Policyholder account balances are equal to: (i) policy account values, which consist of an accumulation of gross premium payments and investment performance; (ii) credited interest, ranging from less than   1%   to   13%   for domestic business and   0%   to   15%   for international business, less expenses, mortality charges and withdrawals; and (iii) fair value adjustments relating to business combinations.

   Guarantees 
  The Company issues directly and assumes through reinsurance variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits. GMABs and the portions of both non-life-contingent GMWBs and GMIBs that do not require annuitization are accounted for as embedded derivatives in policyholder account balances and are further discussed in   Note 9  . Guarantees accounted for as insurance liabilities include: 
                         Guarantee: 
      
    Measurement Assumptions: 
      GMDBs 
      
    A return of purchase payment upon death even if the account value is reduced to zero. 

Present value of expected death benefits in excess of the projected account balance recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on the present value of total expected assessments. 

An enhanced death benefit may be available for an additional fee. 

Assumptions are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. 

Investment performance and volatility assumptions are consistent with the historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S P 500 Index. 

Benefit assumptions are based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios. 
      GMIBs 
      
    After a specified period of time determined at the time of issuance of the variable annuity contract, a minimum accumulation of purchase payments, even if the account value is reduced to zero, that can be annuitized to receive a monthly income stream that is not less than a specified amount. 

Present value of expected income benefits in excess of the projected account balance at any future date of annuitization and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on present value of total expected assessments. 

Certain contracts also provide for a guaranteed lump sum return of purchase premium in lieu of the annuitization benefit. 

Assumptions are consistent with those used for estimating GMDB liabilities. 

Calculation incorporates an assumption for the percentage of the potential annuitizations that may be elected by the contractholder. 
      GMWBs 
      
    A return of purchase payment via partial withdrawals, even if the account value is reduced to zero, provided that cumulative withdrawals in a contract year do not exceed a certain limit. 

Expected value of the life contingent payments and expected assessments using assumptions consistent with those used for estimating the GMDB liabilities. 

Certain contracts include guaranteed withdrawals that are life contingent. 

The Company also issues other annuity contracts that apply a lower rate on funds deposited if the contractholder elects to surrender the contract for cash and a higher rate if the contractholder elects to annuitize. These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death, maturity or at annuitization. Certain other annuity contracts contain guaranteed annuitization benefits that may be above what would be provided by the current account value of the contract. Additionally, the Company issues universal and variable life contracts where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a secondary guarantee or a guaranteed paid-up benefit.

   Information regarding the Company s guarantee exposure was as follows at: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    The Company s annuity and life contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract. Therefore, the amounts listed above may not be mutually exclusive. 
              (2) 
    Includes amounts, which are not reported on the consolidated balance sheets, from assumed reinsurance of certain variable annuity products from the Company s former operating joint venture in Japan. 
              (3) 
    Includes the contractholder s investments in the general account and separate account, if applicable. 
              (4) 
    Defined as the death benefit less the total account value, as of the balance sheet date. It represents the amount of the claim that the Company would incur if death claims were filed on all contracts on the balance sheet date and includes any additional contractual claims associated with riders purchased to assist with covering income taxes payable upon death. 
              (5) 
    Defined as the amount (if any) that would be required to be added to the total account value to purchase a lifetime income stream, based on current annuity rates, equal to the minimum amount provided under the guaranteed benefit. This amount represents the Company s potential economic exposure to such guarantees in the event all contractholders were to annuitize on the balance sheet date, even though the contracts contain terms that allow annuitization of the guaranteed amount only after the 10th anniversary of the contract, which not all contractholders have achieved. 
              (6) 
    Defined as either the excess of the upper tier, adjusted for a profit margin, less the lower tier, as of the balance sheet date or the amount (if any) that would be required to be added to the total account value to purchase a lifetime income stream, based on current annuity rates, equal to the minimum amount provided under the guaranteed benefit. These amounts represent the Company s potential economic exposure to such guarantees in the event all contractholders were to annuitize on the balance sheet date.

Obligations Under Funding Agreements 
  The Company issues fixed and floating rate funding agreements, which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, to certain special purpose entities ( SPEs ) that have issued either debt securities or commercial paper for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements. During the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the Company issued   $48.1 billion  ,   $48.9 billion   and   $37.7 billion  , respectively, and repaid   $49.9 billion  ,   $45.6 billion   and   $36.8 billion  , respectively, of such funding agreements. At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , liabilities for funding agreements outstanding, which are included in policyholder account balances, were   $31.6 billion   and   $33.9 billion  , respectively.

   Such subsidiaries have also entered into funding agreements with FHLBanks and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, a federally chartered instrumentality of the U.S. ( Farmer Mac ). The liability for such funding agreements is included in policyholder account balances. Information related to such funding agreements was as follows at: 
   
 ______________ 
           (1) 
    Represents funding agreements issued to the applicable FHLBank in exchange for cash and for which such FHLBank has been granted a lien on certain assets, some of which are in the custody of such FHLBank, including residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), to collateralize obligations under advances evidenced by funding agreements. The Company is permitted to withdraw any portion of the collateral in the custody of such FHLBank as long as there is no event of default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance level. Upon any event of default by the Company, such FHLBank s recovery on the collateral is limited to the amount of the Company s liability to such FHLBank. 
              (2) 
    Advances are collateralized by mortgage-backed securities. The amount of collateral presented is at estimated fair value. 
              (3) 
    Represents funding agreements issued to certain SPEs that have issued debt securities for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements, and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment of interest and principal by Farmer Mac. The obligations under these funding agreements are secured by a pledge of certain eligible agricultural real estate mortgage loans and may, under certain circumstances, be secured by other qualified collateral. The amount of collateral presented is at carrying value.

   Liabilities for Unpaid Claims and Claim Expenses 
  Information regarding the liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses relating to property   casualty, group accident and non-medical health policies and contracts, which are reported in future policy benefits and other policy-related balances, was as follows: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    During   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , as a result of changes in estimates of insured events in the respective prior year, claims and claim adjustment expenses associated with prior years decreased due to a reduction in prior year automobile bodily injury and homeowners  severity. In addition, 2013 included improved loss ratios for non-medical health claim liabilities. 
       Separate Accounts 
  Separate account assets and liabilities include two categories of account types: pass-through separate accounts totaling   $244.6 billion   and   $261.3 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, for which the policyholder assumes all investment risk, and separate accounts for which the Company contractually guarantees either a minimum return or account value to the policyholder which totaled   $57.0 billion   and   $55.7 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. The latter category consisted primarily of guaranteed interest contracts. The average interest rate credited on these contracts was   2.37%   and   2.25%   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  
  For the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , there were   no   investment gains (losses) on transfers of assets from the general account to the separate accounts.

   5. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, Value of Business Acquired and Other Intangibles 
    See   Note 1   for a description of capitalized acquisition costs. 
  Nonparticipating and Non-Dividend-Paying Traditional Contracts 
  The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to these contracts (term insurance, nonparticipating whole life insurance, traditional group life insurance, non-medical health insurance, and accident   health insurance) over the appropriate premium paying period in proportion to the actual and expected future gross premiums that were set at contract issue. The expected premiums are based upon the premium requirement of each policy and assumptions for mortality, morbidity, persistency and investment returns at policy issuance, or policy acquisition (as it relates to VOBA), include provisions for adverse deviation, and are consistent with the assumptions used to calculate future policyholder benefit liabilities. These assumptions are not revised after policy issuance or acquisition unless the DAC or VOBA balance is deemed to be unrecoverable from future expected profits. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance or acquisition is caused only by variability in premium volumes. 
  Participating, Dividend-Paying Traditional Contracts 
  The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to these contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross margins. The amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The future gross margins are dependent principally on investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, mortality, persistency, expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables, such as inflation. For participating contracts within the closed block (dividend-paying traditional contracts) future gross margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder dividend obligation. See   Note 7  . Of these factors, the Company anticipates that investment returns, expenses, persistency and other factor changes, as well as policyholder dividend scales, are reasonably likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated gross margins with the actual gross margins for that period. When the actual gross margins change from previously estimated gross margins, the cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations. When actual gross margins exceed those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are below the previously estimated gross margins. Each reporting period, the Company also updates the actual amount of business in-force, which impacts expected future gross margins. When expected future gross margins are below those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the expected future gross margins are above the previously estimated expected future gross margins. Each period, the Company also reviews the estimated gross margins for each block of business to determine the recoverability of DAC and VOBA balances. 
  Fixed and Variable Universal Life Contracts and Fixed and Variable Deferred Annuity Contracts 
  The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to these contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross profits. The amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The amount of future gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, persistency, interest crediting rates, expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties, the effect of any hedges used and certain economic variables, such as inflation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates that investment returns, expenses and persistency are reasonably likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that period. When the actual gross profits change from previously estimated gross profits, the cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations. When actual gross profits exceed those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are below the previously estimated gross profits. Each reporting period, the Company also updates the actual amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts expected future gross profits. When expected future gross profits are below those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the expected future gross profits are above the previously estimated expected future gross profits. Each period, the Company also reviews the estimated gross profits for each block of business to determine the recoverability of DAC and VOBA balances. 
  Credit Insurance, Property   Casualty Insurance and Other Short-Duration Contracts 
  The Company amortizes DAC for these contracts, which is primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting expenses, in proportion to actual and future earned premium over the applicable contract term.

   Factors Impacting Amortization 
  Separate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Returns that are higher than the Company s long-term expectation produce higher account balances, which increases the Company s future fee expectations and decreases future benefit payment expectations on minimum death and living benefit guarantees, resulting in higher expected future gross profits. The opposite result occurs when returns are lower than the Company s long-term expectation. The Company s practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. The Company monitors these events and only changes the assumption when its long-term expectation changes. 
  The Company also periodically reviews other long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency and expenses to administer business. Management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease. 
  Periodically, the Company modifies product benefits, features, rights or coverages that occur by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by election or coverage within a contract. If such modification, referred to as an internal replacement, substantially changes the contract, the associated DAC or VOBA is written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the replacement contract are deferred. If the modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC or VOBA amortization on the original contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are expensed. 
  Amortization of DAC and VOBA is attributed to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), and to other expenses for the amount of gross margins or profits originating from transactions other than investment gains and losses. Unrealized investment gains and losses represent the amount of DAC and VOBA that would have been amortized if such gains and losses had been recognized.

6. Reinsurance 
    The Company enters into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for its various insurance products and also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products issued by third parties. The Company participates in reinsurance activities in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks and provide additional capacity for future growth. 
  Accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. The Company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed in Note   8  .

   Americas   Excluding Latin America 
  For its Retail Life   Other insurance products, the Company has historically reinsured the mortality risk primarily on an excess of retention basis or on a quota share basis. The Company currently reinsures   90%   of the mortality risk in excess of   $2 million   for most products. In addition to reinsuring mortality risk as described above, the Company reinsures other risks, as well as specific coverages. Placement of reinsurance is done primarily on an automatic basis and also on a facultative basis for risks with specified characteristics. On a case by case basis, the Company may retain up to   $20 million   per life and reinsure   100%   of amounts in excess of the amount the Company retains. The Company evaluates its reinsurance programs routinely and may increase or decrease its retention at any time. 
  The Company s Retail Annuities business reinsures a portion of the living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with its variable annuities. Under these reinsurance agreements, the Company pays a reinsurance premium generally based on fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and receives reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with the guarantees directly written by the Company with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. 
  For certain policies within the Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits segment, the Company generally retains most of the risk and only cedes particular risks on certain client arrangements. The majority of the Company s reinsurance activity within this segment relates to client agreements for employer sponsored captive programs, risk-sharing agreements and multinational pooling. 
  The Company, through its property   casualty business within the Retail and Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits segments, purchases reinsurance to manage its exposure to large losses (primarily catastrophe losses) and to protect statutory surplus. The Company cedes to reinsurers losses and premiums based upon the exposure of the policies subject to reinsurance. To manage exposure to large property   casualty losses, the Company purchases property catastrophe, casualty and property per risk excess of loss reinsurance protection.  
  The Company s Corporate Benefit Funding segment has periodically engaged in reinsurance activities, on an opportunistic basis. The impact of these activities on the financial results of this segment has not been significant and there were no additional transactions during the periods presented. 
  Latin America, Asia and EMEA 
  For certain life insurance products, the Company currently reinsures risks in excess of   $5 million   to external reinsurers on a yearly renewable term basis. The Company may also reinsure certain risks with external reinsurers depending upon the nature of the risk and local regulatory requirements. For selected large corporate clients, the Company reinsures group employee benefits or credit insurance business with various client-affiliated reinsurance companies, covering policies issued to the employees or customers of the clients. Additionally, the Company cedes and assumes risk with other insurance companies when either company requires a business partner with the appropriate local licensing to issue certain types of policies in certain countries. In these cases, the assuming company typically underwrites the risks, develops the products and assumes most or all of the risk. The Company also has reinsurance agreements in force that reinsure a portion of the living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with variable annuity products. Under these agreements, the Company pays reinsurance fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and receives reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations. 
  Corporate   Other 
  The Company also reinsures, through   100%   quota share reinsurance agreements, certain run-off long-term care and workers  compensation business written by MetLife Insurance Company USA ( MetLife USA ). 
  Corporate   Other also has a reinsurance agreement, whereby it assumes the living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with certain variable annuity products. Under this agreement, the Company receives reinsurance fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and provides reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations.

   Catastrophe Coverage 
  The Company has exposure to catastrophes which could contribute to significant fluctuations in the Company s results of operations. In the Americas, excluding Latin America, the Company uses excess of retention and quota share reinsurance agreements to provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposure to larger risks. Currently, for Latin America, Asia and EMEA, the Company purchases catastrophe coverage to insure risks within certain countries deemed by management to be exposed to the greatest catastrophic risks. 
    Reinsurance Recoverables 
  The Company reinsures its business through a diversified group of well-capitalized reinsurers. The Company analyzes recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with its reinsurers. The Company monitors ratings and evaluates the financial strength of its reinsurers by analyzing their financial statements. In addition, the reinsurance recoverable balance due from each reinsurer is evaluated as part of the overall monitoring process. Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances is evaluated based on these analyses. The Company generally secures large reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. These reinsurance recoverable balances are stated net of allowances for uncollectible reinsurance, which at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , were not significant. 
  The Company has secured certain reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. The Company had   $6.1 billion   and   $5.9 billion   of unsecured reinsurance recoverable balances at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  At December 31,   2015  , the Company had   $15.3 billion   of net ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total,   $10.8 billion  , or   71%  , were with the Company s five largest ceded reinsurers, including   $2.3 billion   of net ceded reinsurance recoverables which were unsecured. At December 31,   2014  , the Company had   $14.9 billion   of net ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total,   $10.8 billion  , or   73%  , were with the Company s five largest ceded reinsurers, including   $2.6 billion   of net ceded reinsurance recoverables which were unsecured. 
  The Company has reinsured with an unaffiliated third-party reinsurer,   59.25%   of the closed block through a modified coinsurance agreement. The Company accounts for this agreement under the deposit method of accounting. The Company, having the right of offset, has offset the modified coinsurance deposit with the deposit recoverable.

   Reinsurance agreements that do not expose the Company to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk are recorded using the deposit method of accounting. The deposit assets on reinsurance were   $2.3 billion   at both December 31,   2015   and   2014  . The deposit liabilities on reinsurance were   $33 million   and   $35 million   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    7. Closed Block 
    On April 7, 2000 (the  Demutualization Date ), Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MLIC ) converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance approving MLIC s plan of reorganization, as amended (the  Plan of Reorganization ). On the Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and projected experience against the experience assumed in the then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted periodically to give effect to changes in experience. 
  The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and other experience related to the closed block are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed block policyholders in the future may be greater than or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts assumed will be available for distribution over time to closed block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders. If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over 100 years. 
  The Company uses the same accounting principles to account for the participating policies included in the closed block as it used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over closed block assets at the Demutualization Date (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in AOCI) represents the estimated maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result from operations attributed to the closed block after income taxes. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income over the period the policies and contracts in the closed block remain in-force. Management believes that over time the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block will approximately equal the expected cumulative earnings due to the effect of dividend changes. If, over the period the closed block remains in existence, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will pay the excess of the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block over the expected cumulative earnings to closed block policyholders as additional policyholder dividends unless offset by future unfavorable experience of the closed block and, accordingly, will recognize only the expected cumulative earnings in income with the excess recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. If over such period, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are less than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may change policyholder dividend scales in the future, which would be intended to increase future actual earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected cumulative earnings. 
  Experience within the closed block, in particular mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses, directly impact the policyholder dividend obligation. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which resides outside of the closed block, is based upon cumulative actual and expected earnings within the closed block. Accordingly, the Company s net income continues to be sensitive to the actual performance of the closed block. 
  Closed block assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are combined on a line-by-line basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular item.

    See Note   10   for information about the fair value hierarchy for investments and the related valuation methodologies. 
  Investment Risks and Uncertainties 
  Investments are exposed to the following primary sources of risk: credit, interest rate, liquidity, market valuation, currency and real estate risk. The financial statement risks, stemming from such investment risks, are those associated with the determination of estimated fair values, the diminished ability to sell certain investments in times of strained market conditions, the recognition of impairments, the recognition of income on certain investments and the potential consolidation of VIEs. The use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs relating to these financial statement risks may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements. 
  The determination of valuation allowances and impairments is highly subjective and is based upon periodic evaluations and assessments of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. 
  The recognition of income on certain investments (e.g. structured securities, including mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities ( ABS ), certain structured investment transactions and FVO and trading securities) is dependent upon certain factors such as prepayments and defaults, and changes in such factors could result in changes in amounts to be earned.

    The noncredit loss component of OTTI losses for CMBS was in an unrealized gain position of   $1 million   at both December 31,   2015   and   2014  , due to increases in estimated fair value subsequent to initial recognition of noncredit losses on such securities. See also    Net Unrealized Investment Gains (Losses).  
     The Company held non-income producing fixed maturity securities with an estimated fair value of   $54 million   and   $64 million   with unrealized gains (losses) of   $12 million   and   $28 million   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  Methodology for Amortization of Premium and Accretion of Discount on Structured Securities 
  Amortization of premium and accretion of discount on structured securities considers the estimated timing and amount of prepayments of the underlying loans. Actual prepayment experience is periodically reviewed and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between the originally anticipated and the actual prepayments received and currently anticipated. Prepayment assumptions for single class and multi-class mortgage-backed and ABS are estimated using inputs obtained from third-party specialists and based on management s knowledge of the current market. For credit-sensitive mortgage-backed and ABS and certain prepayment-sensitive securities, the effective yield is recalculated on a prospective basis. For all other mortgage-backed and ABS, the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis. 
  Maturities of Fixed Maturity Securities 
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities, by contractual maturity date, were as follows at   December 31, 2015  : 

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to the exercise of call or prepayment options. Fixed maturity securities not due at a single maturity date have been presented in the year of final contractual maturity. Structured securities (RMBS, ABS and CMBS) are shown separately, as they are not due at a single maturity.

   Continuous Gross Unrealized Losses for Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities AFS by Sector 
  The following table presents the estimated fair value and gross unrealized losses of fixed maturity and equity securities AFS in an unrealized loss position, aggregated by sector and by length of time that the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position. 

Evaluation of AFS Securities for OTTI and Evaluating Temporarily Impaired AFS Securities 
  Evaluation and Measurement Methodologies 
  Management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Considerations used in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the estimated fair value has been below cost or amortized cost; (ii) the potential for impairments when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties; (iii) the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub-sector; (iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for impairments where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic loss or has exhausted natural resources; (vi) with respect to fixed maturity securities, whether the Company has the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell a particular security before the decline in estimated fair value below amortized cost recovers; (vii) with respect to structured securities, changes in forecasted cash flows after considering the quality of underlying collateral, expected prepayment speeds, current and forecasted loss severity, consideration of the payment terms of the underlying assets backing a particular security, and the payment priority within the tranche structure of the security; (viii) the potential for impairments due to weakening of foreign currencies on non-functional currency denominated fixed maturity securities that are near maturity; and (ix) other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies. 
    236 

       Table of Contents  
  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  8. Investments (continued) 

   The methodology and significant inputs used to determine the amount of credit loss on fixed maturity securities are as follows: 
             
    The Company calculates the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate is generally the effective interest rate of the security prior to impairment. 
                
    When determining collectability and the period over which value is expected to recover, the Company applies considerations utilized in its overall impairment evaluation process which incorporates information regarding the specific security, fundamentals of the industry and geographic area in which the security issuer operates, and overall macroeconomic conditions. Projected future cash flows are estimated using assumptions derived from management s best estimates of likely scenario-based outcomes after giving consideration to a variety of variables that include, but are not limited to: payment terms of the security; the likelihood that the issuer can service the interest and principal payments; the quality and amount of any credit enhancements; the security s position within the capital structure of the issuer; possible corporate restructurings or asset sales by the issuer; and changes to the rating of the security or the issuer by rating agencies. 
                
    Additional considerations are made when assessing the unique features that apply to certain structured securities including, but not limited to: the quality of underlying collateral, expected prepayment speeds, current and forecasted loss severity, consideration of the payment terms of the underlying loans or assets backing a particular security, and the payment priority within the tranche structure of the security. 
                
    When determining the amount of the credit loss for U.S. and foreign corporate securities, foreign government securities and state and political subdivision securities, the estimated fair value is considered the recovery value when available information does not indicate that another value is more appropriate. When information is identified that indicates a recovery value other than estimated fair value, management considers in the determination of recovery value the same considerations utilized in its overall impairment evaluation process as described above, as well as any private and public sector programs to restructure such securities. 
     With respect to securities that have attributes of debt and equity (perpetual hybrid securities), consideration is given in the OTTI analysis as to whether there has been any deterioration in the credit of the issuer and the likelihood of recovery in value of the securities that are in a severe and extended unrealized loss position. Consideration is also given as to whether any perpetual hybrid securities, with an unrealized loss, regardless of credit rating, have deferred any dividend payments. When an OTTI loss has occurred, the OTTI loss is the entire difference between the perpetual hybrid security s cost and its estimated fair value with a corresponding charge to earnings. 
  The cost or amortized cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for OTTI in the period in which the determination is made. The Company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value. 
  In periods subsequent to the recognition of OTTI on a fixed maturity security, the Company accounts for the impaired security as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment. Accordingly, the discount (or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis is accreted over the remaining term of the fixed maturity security in a prospective manner based on the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows. 
  Current Period Evaluation 
  Based on the Company s current evaluation of its AFS securities in an unrealized loss position in accordance with its impairment policy, and the Company s current intentions and assessments (as applicable to the type of security) about holding, selling and any requirements to sell these securities, the Company concluded that these securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31,   2015  . Future OTTI will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), changes in credit ratings, collateral valuation, interest rates and credit spreads. If economic fundamentals deteriorate or if there are adverse changes in the above factors, OTTI may be incurred in upcoming periods. 
  Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities increased   $3.4 billion   during the year ended December 31,   2015   to   $5.4 billion  . The increase in gross unrealized losses for the year ended December 31,   2015  , was primarily attributable to widening credit spreads, an increase in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, the impact of weakening foreign currencies on non-functional currency denominated fixed maturity securities.

  8. Investments (continued) 

   At December 31,   2015  ,   $364 million   of the total   $5.4 billion   of gross unrealized losses were from   69   fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss position of   20%   or more of amortized cost for six months or greater. 
  Investment Grade Fixed Maturity Securities 
  Of the   $364 million   of gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss of   20%   or more of amortized cost for six months or greater,   $242 million  , or   66%  , were related to gross unrealized losses on   36   investment grade fixed maturity securities. Unrealized losses on investment grade fixed maturity securities are principally related to widening credit spreads and, with respect to fixed-rate fixed maturity securities, rising interest rates since purchase. 
  Below Investment Grade Fixed Maturity Securities 
  Of the   $364 million   of gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss of   20%   or more of amortized cost for six months or greater,   $122 million  , or   34%  , were related to gross unrealized losses on   33   below investment grade fixed maturity securities. Unrealized losses on below investment grade fixed maturity securities are principally related to U.S. and foreign corporate securities (primarily utility and industrial securities) and non-agency RMBS (primarily alternative residential mortgage loans) and are the result of significantly wider credit spreads resulting from higher risk premiums since purchase, largely due to economic and market uncertainties including concerns over   lower oil prices in the energy sector and   valuations of residential real estate supporting non-agency RMBS. Management evaluates U.S. and foreign corporate securities based on factors such as expected cash flows and the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuers and evaluates non-agency RMBS based on actual and projected cash flows after considering the quality of underlying collateral, expected prepayment speeds, current and forecasted loss severity, consideration of the payment terms of the underlying assets backing a particular security and the payment priority within the tranche structure of the security. 
  Equity Securities 
  Gross unrealized losses on equity securities increased   $91 million   during the year ended December 31,   2015   to   $158 million  . Of the   $158 million  ,   $36 million   were from   12   securities with gross unrealized losses of   20%   or more of cost for 12 months or greater. Of the   $36 million  ,   64%   were rated A or better, and all were from financial services industry investment grade non-redeemable preferred stock securities.

   Valuation Allowance Methodology 
  Mortgage loans are considered to be impaired when it is probable that, based upon current information and events, the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the loan agreement. Specific valuation allowances are established using the same methodology for all three portfolio segments as the excess carrying value of a loan over either (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate, (ii) the estimated fair value of the loan s underlying collateral if the loan is in the process of foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent, or (iii) the loan s observable market price. A common evaluation framework is used for establishing non-specific valuation allowances for all loan portfolio segments; however, a separate non-specific valuation allowance is calculated and maintained for each loan portfolio segment that is based on inputs unique to each loan portfolio segment. Non-specific valuation allowances are established for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property-specific or market-specific risk has not been identified, but for which the Company expects to incur a credit loss. These evaluations are based upon several loan portfolio segment-specific factors, including the Company s experience for loan losses, defaults and loss severity, and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics. These evaluations are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. 
  Commercial and Agricultural Mortgage Loan Portfolio Segments 
  The Company typically uses several years of historical experience in establishing non-specific valuation allowances which captures multiple economic cycles. For evaluations of commercial mortgage loans, in addition to historical experience, management considers factors that include the impact of a rapid change to the economy, which may not be reflected in the loan portfolio, and recent loss and recovery trend experience as compared to historical loss and recovery experience. For evaluations of agricultural mortgage loans, in addition to historical experience, management considers factors that include increased stress in certain sectors, which may be evidenced by higher delinquency rates, or a change in the number of higher risk loans. On a quarterly basis, management incorporates the impact of these current market events and conditions on historical experience in determining the non-specific valuation allowance established for commercial and agricultural mortgage loans. 
  All commercial mortgage loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis which may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. All agricultural mortgage loans are monitored on an ongoing basis. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar to the commercial mortgage loan monitoring process, with a focus on higher risk loans, including reviews on a geographic and property-type basis. Higher risk loans are reviewed individually on an ongoing basis for potential credit loss and specific valuation allowances are established using the methodology described above. Quarterly, the remaining loans are reviewed on a pool basis by aggregating groups of loans that have similar risk characteristics for potential credit loss, and non-specific valuation allowances are established as described above using inputs that are unique to each segment of the loan portfolio. 
  For commercial mortgage loans, the primary credit quality indicator is the debt service coverage ratio, which compares a property s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the debt service coverage ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The Company also reviews the loan-to-value ratio of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Loan-to-value ratios compare the unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. Generally, the higher the loan-to-value ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss.   The debt service coverage ratio and the values utilized in calculating the ratio are updated annually on a rolling basis, with a portion of the portfolio updated each quarter. In addition, the loan-to-value ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of the Company s ongoing review of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio. 
  For agricultural mortgage loans, the Company s primary credit quality indicator is the loan-to-value ratio. The values utilized in calculating this ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural mortgage loan portfolio and are routinely updated.

   Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio Segment 
  The Company s residential mortgage loan portfolio is comprised primarily of closed end, amortizing residential mortgage loans. For evaluations of residential mortgage loans, the key inputs of expected frequency and expected loss reflect current market conditions, with expected frequency adjusted, when appropriate, for differences from market conditions and the Company s historical experience. In contrast to the commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolios, residential mortgage loans are smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. Non-specific valuation allowances are established using the evaluation framework described above for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics from inputs that are unique to the residential segment of the loan portfolio. Loan specific valuation allowances are only established on residential mortgage loans when they have been restructured and are established using the methodology described above for all loan portfolio segments. 
  For residential mortgage loans, the Company s primary credit quality indicator is whether the loan is performing or nonperforming. The Company generally defines nonperforming residential mortgage loans as those that are 60 or more days past due and/or in non-accrual status which is assessed monthly. Generally, nonperforming residential mortgage loans have a higher risk of experiencing a credit loss. 
  Credit Quality of Commercial Mortgage Loans

   Mortgage Loans Modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring 
  For a small portion of the mortgage loan portfolio, classified as troubled debt restructurings, concessions are granted related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Generally, the types of concessions include: reduction of the contractual interest rate, extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than current market interest rates, and/or a reduction of accrued interest. The amount, timing and extent of the concession granted is considered in determining any impairment or changes in the specific valuation allowance. During the years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company did not have a significant amount of mortgage loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring. 
    Other Invested Assets 
  Other invested assets is comprised primarily of freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values (see Note   9  ), tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, and leveraged and direct financing leases. 
  Tax Credit Partnerships 
  The carrying value of tax credit partnerships was   $1.6 billion   at both December 31, 2015 and 2014. Losses from tax credit partnerships included within net investment income were   $164 million  ,   $149 million  , and   $139 million   for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
  Leveraged and Direct Financing Leases 
  Investment in leveraged and direct financing leases consisted of the following at: 

Rental receivables are generally due in periodic installments.   The payment periods for leveraged leases generally range from one to 15 years but in certain circumstances can be over 30 years, while the payment periods for direct financing leases range from one to 30 years.   For rental receivables, the primary credit quality indicator is whether the rental receivable is performing or nonperforming, which is assessed monthly. The Company generally defines nonperforming rental receivables as those that are 90 days or more past due. At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , all leveraged lease receivables were performing and over   99%   of direct financing rental receivables were performing. 
  The deferred income tax liability related to leveraged leases was   $1.5 billion   at both December 31,   2015   and   2014  . 
  The components of income from investments in leveraged and direct financing leases, excluding net investment gains (losses), were as follows:

   The cash collateral liability by loaned security type and remaining tenor of the agreements were as follows at: 

__________________ 
           (1) 
    The related loaned security could be returned to the Company on the next business day which would require the Company to immediately return the cash collateral. 
     If the Company is required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice and is forced to sell securities to meet the return obligation, it may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than what otherwise would have been realized under normal market conditions, or both. The estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to the cash collateral on open at   December 31, 2015   was   $9.9 billion  , over   99%   of which were U.S. Treasury and agency securities which, if put back to the Company, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirement.  
  The reinvestment portfolio acquired with the cash collateral consisted principally of fixed maturity securities (including U.S. Treasury and agency, agency RMBS, ABS, U.S. corporate securities, non-agency RMBS and foreign corporate securities) with   60%   invested in U.S. Treasury and agency securities, agency RMBS, cash equivalents, short-term investments or held in cash. If the securities on loan or the reinvestment portfolio become less liquid, the Company has the liquidity resources of most of its general account available to meet any potential cash demands when securities on loan are put back to the Company.

     See    Securities Lending  for information regarding securities on loan and Note   7   for information regarding investments designated to the closed block. 
    Purchased Credit Impaired Investments 
  Investments acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the acquisition date that the Company will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are classified as purchased credit impaired ( PCI ) investments. For each investment, the excess of the cash flows expected to be collected as of the acquisition date over its acquisition date fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized as net investment income on an effective yield basis. If, subsequently, based on current information and events, it is probable that there is a significant increase in cash flows previously expected to be collected or if actual cash flows are significantly greater than cash flows previously expected to be collected, the accretable yield is adjusted prospectively. The excess of the contractually required payments (including interest) as of the acquisition date over the cash flows expected to be collected as of the acquisition date is referred to as the nonaccretable difference, and this amount is not expected to be realized as net investment income. Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected can result in OTTI or the recognition of mortgage loan valuation allowances. 
  The Company s PCI investments, by invested asset class, were as follows at: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Represents the contractually required payments, which is the sum of contractual principal, whether or not currently due, and accrued interest. 
              (2) 
    Estimated fair value plus accrued interest for fixed maturity securities and amortized cost, plus accrued interest, less any valuation allowances, for mortgage loans.

Collectively Significant Equity Method Investments 
  The Company holds investments in real estate joint ventures, real estate funds and other limited partnership interests consisting of leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, joint ventures and other funds. The portion of these investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of   $14.6 billion   at December 31,   2015  . The Company s maximum exposure to loss related to these equity method investments is limited to the carrying value of these investments plus unfunded commitments of   $5.2 billion   at December 31,   2015  . Except for certain real estate joint ventures, the Company s investments in real estate funds and other limited partnership interests are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not participate in the management of the entities. 
  As described in Note   1  , the Company generally records its share of earnings in its equity method investments using a three-month lag methodology and within net investment income. Aggregate net investment income from these equity method investments exceeded   10%   of the Company s consolidated pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations for only one of the three most recent annual periods:   2013  . The Company is providing the following aggregated summarized financial data for such equity method investments, for the most recent annual periods, in order to provide comparative information. This aggregated summarized financial data does not represent the Company s proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, or earnings of such entities. 
  The aggregated summarized financial data presented below reflects the latest available financial information and is as of, and for, the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . Aggregate total assets of these entities totaled   $447.5 billion   and   $385.7 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Aggregate total liabilities of these entities totaled   $72.0 billion   and   $39.5 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Aggregate net income (loss) of these entities totaled   $25.8 billion  ,   $34.9 billion   and   $26.3 billion   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Aggregate net income (loss) from the underlying entities in which the Company invests is primarily comprised of investment income, including recurring investment income and realized and unrealized investment gains (losses).

   Variable Interest Entities 
  The Company has invested in certain structured transactions (including CSEs), formed trusts to invest proceeds from certain collateral financing arrangements and has insurance operations that are VIEs. In certain instances, the Company holds both the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity, as well as an economic interest in the entity and, as such, is deemed to be the primary beneficiary or consolidator of the entity. 
  The determination of the VIE s primary beneficiary requires an evaluation of the contractual and implied rights and obligations associated with each party s relationship with or involvement in the entity, an estimate of the entity s expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party involved in the entity. The Company generally uses a qualitative approach to determine whether it is the primary beneficiary. However, for VIEs that are investment companies or apply measurement principles consistent with those utilized by investment companies, the primary beneficiary is based on a risks and rewards model and is defined as the entity that will absorb a majority of a VIE s expected losses, receive a majority of a VIE s expected residual returns if no single entity absorbs a majority of expected losses, or both. The Company reassesses its involvement with VIEs on a quarterly basis. The use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs in the determination of the primary beneficiary could have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements. 
  Consolidated VIEs 
  Creditors or beneficial interest holders of VIEs where the Company is the primary beneficiary have no recourse to the general credit of the Company, as the Company s obligation to the VIEs is limited to the amount of its committed investment. 
  The following table presents the total assets and total liabilities relating to VIEs for which the Company has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary and which are consolidated at December 31,   2015   and   2014  .  

______________ 
           (1) 
    See Note   13   for a description of the MetLife Reinsurance Company of South Carolina ( MRSC ) collateral financing arrangement. 
              (2) 
    Assets of the operating joint venture are primarily fixed maturity securities and separate account assets. Liabilities of the operating joint venture are primarily future policy benefits, other policyholder funds and separate account liabilities. 
              (3) 
    The Company consolidates entities that are structured as CMBS and as collateralized debt obligations. The assets of these entities can only be used to settle their respective liabilities, and under no circumstances is the Company liable for any principal or interest shortfalls should any arise. The Company s exposure was limited to that of its remaining investment in these entities of   $105 million   and   $123 million   at estimated fair value at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. The long-term debt bears interest primarily at fixed rates ranging from   2.25%   to   5.57%  , payable primarily on a monthly basis. Interest expense related to these obligations, included in other expenses, was   $8 million  ,   $38 million   and   $122 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   respectively. 
              (4) 
    Other investments is comprised of other invested assets, other limited partnerships interests, FVO and trading securities, and real estate joint ventures.

   Unconsolidated VIEs 
  The carrying amount and maximum exposure to loss relating to VIEs in which the Company holds a significant variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary and which have not been consolidated were as follows at: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    The maximum exposure to loss relating to fixed maturity securities AFS, FVO and trading securities and equity securities AFS is equal to their carrying amounts or the carrying amounts of retained interests. The maximum exposure to loss relating to other limited partnership interests, mortgage loans and real estate joint ventures is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments. For certain of its investments in other invested assets, the Company s return is in the form of income tax credits which are guaranteed by creditworthy third parties. For such investments, the maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments, reduced by income tax credits guaranteed by third parties of   $179 million   and   $212 million   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Such a maximum loss would be expected to occur only upon bankruptcy of the issuer or investee. 
              (2) 
    For these variable interests, the Company s involvement is limited to that of a passive investor in mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities issued by trusts that do not have substantial equity. 
              (3) 
    Other investments is comprised of mortgage loans and non-redeemable preferred stock. 
     As described in Note   21  , the Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in the normal course of business. Excluding these commitments, the Company did not provide financial or other support to investees designated as VIEs during the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  .

  9. Derivatives (continued) 

   Derivatives are financial instruments with values derived from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and/or other financial indices. Derivatives may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ( OTC ) market. Certain of the Company s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties ( OTC-cleared ), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties ( OTC-bilateral ). The types of derivatives the Company uses include swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit default swaps and structured interest rate swaps to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily available in the cash market.  
  Interest Rate Derivatives 
  The Company uses a variety of interest rate derivatives to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors, swaptions, futures and forwards. 
  Interest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (duration mismatches). In an interest rate swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts as calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. The Company utilizes interest rate swaps in fair value, cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  The Company uses structured interest rate swaps to synthetically create investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and a cash instrument such as a U.S. Treasury, agency, or other fixed maturity security. Structured interest rate swaps are included in interest rate swaps and are not designated as hedging instruments. 
  The Company purchases interest rate caps and floors primarily to protect its floating rate liabilities against rises in interest rates above a specified level, and against interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, as well as to protect its minimum rate guarantee liabilities against declines in interest rates below a specified level, respectively. In certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased caps and floors by entering into offsetting written caps and floors. The Company utilizes interest rate caps and floors in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  In exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the different classes of interest rate securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange. Exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures are used primarily to hedge mismatches between the duration of assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities supported by those assets, to hedge against changes in value of securities the Company owns or anticipates acquiring, to hedge against changes in interest rates on anticipated liability issuances by replicating Treasury or swap curve performance, and to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded interest rate futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  Swaptions are used by the Company to hedge interest rate risk associated with the Company s long-term liabilities and invested assets. A swaption is an option to enter into a swap with a forward starting effective date. In certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased swaptions by entering into offsetting written swaptions. The Company pays a premium for purchased swaptions and receives a premium for written swaptions. The Company utilizes swaptions in nonqualifying hedging relationships. Swaptions are included in interest rate options. 
  The Company enters into interest rate forwards to buy and sell securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future date. The Company utilizes interest rate forwards in cash flow hedging relationships. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Derivatives 
  The Company uses foreign currency exchange rate derivatives, including foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forwards, currency options and exchange-traded currency futures, to reduce the risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with its assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of its net investments in foreign operations.

   In a foreign currency swap transaction, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between one currency and another at a fixed exchange rate, generally set at inception, calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. The notional amount of each currency is exchanged at the inception and termination of the currency swap by each party. The Company utilizes foreign currency swaps in fair value, cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  In a foreign currency forward transaction, the Company agrees with another party to deliver a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future date. The Company utilizes foreign currency forwards in fair value, net investment in foreign operations and nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  The Company enters into currency options that give it the right, but not the obligation, to sell the foreign currency amount in exchange for a functional currency amount within a limited time at a contracted price. The contracts may also be net settled in cash, based on differentials in the foreign currency exchange rate and the strike price. The Company uses currency options to hedge against the foreign currency exposure inherent in certain of its variable annuity products. The Company also uses currency options as an economic hedge of foreign currency exposure related to the Company s international subsidiaries. The Company utilizes currency options in net investment in foreign operations and nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  To a lesser extent, the Company uses exchange-traded currency futures to hedge currency mismatches between assets and liabilities, and to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded currency futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  Credit Derivatives 
  The Company enters into purchased credit default swaps to hedge against credit-related changes in the value of its investments. In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with another party to pay, at specified intervals, a premium to hedge credit risk. If a credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, the contract may be cash settled or it may be settled gross by the delivery of par quantities of the referenced investment equal to the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the counterparty equal to the par value of the investment surrendered. Credit events vary by type of issuer but typically include bankruptcy, failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, involuntary restructuring or governmental intervention. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA ) deems that a credit event has occurred. The Company utilizes credit default swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  The Company enters into written credit default swaps to synthetically create credit investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and one or more cash instruments, such as U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities or other fixed maturity securities. These credit default swaps are not designated as hedging instruments. 
  The Company also enters into certain purchased and written credit default swaps held in relation to trading portfolios for the purpose of generating profits on short-term differences in price. These credit default swaps are not designated as hedging instruments. 
  The Company enters into forwards to lock in the price to be paid for forward purchases of certain securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for the contract is made at a specified future date. When the primary purpose of entering into these transactions is to hedge against the risk of changes in purchase price due to changes in credit spreads, the Company designates these transactions as credit forwards. The Company utilizes credit forwards in cash flow hedging relationships. 
  Equity Derivatives 
  The Company uses a variety of equity derivatives to reduce its exposure to equity market risk, including equity index options, equity variance swaps, exchange-traded equity futures and total rate of return swaps ( TRRs ).

   Equity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. To hedge against adverse changes in equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the equity index within a limited time at a contracted price. The contracts will be net settled in cash based on differentials in the indices at the time of exercise and the strike price. Certain of these contracts may also contain settlement provisions linked to interest rates. In certain instances, the Company may enter into a combination of transactions to hedge adverse changes in equity indices within a pre-determined range through the purchase and sale of options. The Company utilizes equity index options in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  Equity variance swaps are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. In an equity variance swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future, based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period. The Company utilizes equity variance swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  In exchange-traded equity futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the different classes of equity securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange. Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products offered by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded equity futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships. 
  TRRs are swaps whereby the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward of an asset or a market index and the LIBOR, calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. No cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. The Company uses TRRs to hedge its equity market guarantees in certain of its insurance products. TRRs can be used as hedges or to synthetically create investments. The Company utilizes TRRs in nonqualifying hedging relationships.

   Primary Risks Managed by Derivatives 
  The following table presents the gross notional amount, estimated fair value and primary underlying risk exposure of the Company s derivatives, excluding embedded derivatives, held at:

       Table of Contents  
  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  9. Derivatives (continued) 

   Based on gross notional amounts, a substantial portion of the Company s derivatives was not designated or did not qualify as part of a hedging relationship at both   December 31, 2015   and   2014  . The Company s use of derivatives includes (i) derivatives that serve as macro hedges of the Company s exposure to various risks and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting due to the criteria required under the portfolio hedging rules; (ii) derivatives that economically hedge insurance liabilities that contain mortality or morbidity risk and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting because the lack of these risks in the derivatives cannot support an expectation of a highly effective hedging relationship; (iii) derivatives that economically hedge embedded derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting because the changes in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are already recorded in net income; and (iv) written credit default swaps that are used to synthetically create credit investments and that do not qualify for hedge accounting because they do not involve a hedging relationship. For these nonqualified derivatives, changes in market factors can lead to the recognition of fair value changes on the statement of operations without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged. 
    Net Derivative Gains (Losses) 
  The components of net derivative gains (losses) were as follows:

   Nonqualifying Derivatives and Derivatives for Purposes Other Than Hedging 
  The following table presents the amount and location of gains (losses) recognized in income for derivatives that were not designated or qualifying as hedging instruments: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Changes in estimated fair value related to economic hedges of equity method investments in joint ventures, derivatives held in relation to trading portfolios and derivatives held within contractholder-directed unit-linked investments. 
              (2) 
    Changes in estimated fair value related to economic hedges of variable annuity guarantees included in future policy benefits. 
       Fair Value Hedges 
  The Company designates and accounts for the following as fair value hedges when they have met the requirements of fair value hedging: (i) interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate assets and liabilities to floating rate assets and liabilities; (ii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency fair value exposure of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities; and (iii) foreign currency forwards to hedge the foreign currency fair value exposure of foreign currency denominated investments. 
    259

   The Company recognizes gains and losses on derivatives and the related hedged items in fair value hedges within net derivative gains (losses). The following table presents the amount of such net derivative gains (losses): 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Fixed rate liabilities reported in policyholder account balances or future policy benefits. 
              (2) 
    Fixed rate or floating rate liabilities. 
     For the Company s foreign currency forwards, the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative related to the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For all other derivatives, all components of each derivative s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the component of the change in estimated fair value of derivatives that was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness was   ($11) million  ,   $3 million   and   ($2) million  , respectively.  
    Cash Flow Hedges 
  The Company designates and accounts for the following as cash flow hedges when they have met the requirements of cash flow hedging: (i) interest rate swaps to convert floating rate assets and liabilities to fixed rate assets and liabilities; (ii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency cash flow exposure of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities; (iii) interest rate forwards and credit forwards to lock in the price to be paid for forward purchases of investments; (iv) interest rate swaps and interest rate forwards to hedge the forecasted purchases of fixed-rate investments; and (v) interest rate swaps and interest rate forwards to hedge forecasted fixed-rate borrowings.

   In certain instances, the Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable of occurring. Because certain of the forecasted transactions also were not probable of occurring within two months of the anticipated date, the Company reclassified amounts from AOCI into net derivative gains (losses). These amounts were   $11 million  ,   ($15) million   and   ($1) million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , the maximum length of time over which the Company was hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions did not exceed   five   years and   six   years, respectively. 
  At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , the balance in AOCI associated with cash flow hedges was   $2.4 billion   and   $1.8 billion  , respectively. 
  The following table presents the effects of derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships on the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated statements of equity: 

All components of each derivative s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
  At December 31,   2015  ,   $50 million   of deferred net gains (losses) on derivatives in AOCI was expected to be reclassified to earnings within the next 12 months. 
    Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations 
  The Company uses foreign currency exchange rate derivatives, which may include foreign currency forwards and currency options, to hedge portions of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The Company measures ineffectiveness on these derivatives based upon the change in forward rates.  
  When net investments in foreign operations are sold or substantially liquidated, the amounts in AOCI are reclassified to the statement of operations.

   The following table presents the effects of derivatives in net investment hedging relationships on the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated statements of equity: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    During the   years ended December 31, 2015   and   2013  , there were   no   sales or substantial liquidations of net investments in foreign operations that would have required the reclassification of gains or losses from AOCI into earnings. In May 2014, the Company sold its interest in MAL, which was a hedged item in a net investment hedging relationship. See Note 3. As a result, during the   year ended December 31, 2014  , the Company released losses of   $77 million   from AOCI into earnings upon the sale. 
              (2) 
    There was   no   ineffectiveness recognized for the Company s hedges of net investments in foreign operations. All components of each derivative s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
     At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , the cumulative foreign currency translation gain (loss) recorded in AOCI related to hedges of net investments in foreign operations was   $1.1 billion   and   $940 million  , respectively. 
    Credit Derivatives 
  In connection with synthetically created credit investment transactions and credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio, the Company writes credit default swaps for which it receives a premium to insure credit risk. Such credit derivatives are included within the nonqualifying derivatives and derivatives for purposes other than hedging table. If a credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, the contract may be cash settled or it may be settled gross by the Company paying the counterparty the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the delivery of par quantities of the referenced credit obligation. The Company s maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of all referenced credit obligations is zero, was   $10.3 billion   and   $10.5 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. The Company can terminate these contracts at any time through cash settlement with the counterparty at an amount equal to the then current estimated fair value of the credit default swaps. At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , the Company would have received   $65 million   and   $175 million  , respectively, to terminate all of these contracts.

   The following table presents the estimated fair value, maximum amount of future payments and weighted average years to maturity of written credit default swaps at: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    The rating agency designations are based on availability and the midpoint of the applicable ratings among Moody s Investors Service ( Moody s ), S P and Fitch Ratings. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used. 
              (2) 
    The weighted average years to maturity of the credit default swaps is calculated based on weighted average gross notional amounts. 
     The Company has also entered into credit default swaps to purchase credit protection on certain of the referenced credit obligations in the table above. As a result, the maximum amounts of potential future recoveries available to offset the   $10.3 billion   and   $10.5 billion   from the table above were   $80 million   and   $75 million   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  Written credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio amounted to   $20 million   and   $15 million   in gross notional amount and   ($2) million   and   $1 million   in estimated fair value at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    Credit Risk on Freestanding Derivatives 
  The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Generally, the current credit exposure of the Company s derivatives is limited to the net positive estimated fair value of derivatives at the reporting date after taking into consideration the existence of master netting or similar agreements and any collateral received pursuant to such agreements. 
    263 

     Table of Contents

   The Company manages its credit risk related to derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties and establishing and monitoring exposure limits. The Company s OTC-bilateral derivative transactions are generally governed by ISDA Master Agreements which provide for legally enforceable set-off and close-out netting of exposures to specific counterparties in the event of early termination of a transaction, which includes, but is not limited to, events of default and bankruptcy. In the event of an early termination, the Company is permitted to set off receivables from the counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. Substantially all of the Company s ISDA Master Agreements also include Credit Support Annex provisions which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in connection with its OTC-bilateral derivatives. 
  The Company s OTC-cleared derivatives are effected through central clearing counterparties and its exchange-traded derivatives are effected through regulated exchanges. Such positions are marked to market and margined on a daily basis (both initial margin and variation margin), and the Company has minimal exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such derivatives. 
  See Note   10   for a description of the impact of credit risk on the valuation of derivatives. 
  The estimated fair values of the Company s net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral were as follows at: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    At   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , derivative assets included income or expense accruals reported in accrued investment income or in other liabilities of   $278 million   and   $255 million  , respectively, and derivative liabilities included income or expense accruals reported in accrued investment income or in other liabilities of   $41 million   and   $60 million  , respectively. 
       264 

     Table of Contents  
  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  9. Derivatives (continued) 

            (2) 
    Estimated fair value of derivatives is limited to the amount that is subject to set-off and includes income or expense accruals. 
              (3) 
    Cash collateral received by the Company for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives is included in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments or in fixed maturity securities, and the obligation to return it is included in payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions on the balance sheet. In certain instances, cash collateral pledged to the Company as initial margin for OTC-bilateral derivatives is held in separate custodial accounts and is not recorded on the Company s balance sheet because the account title is in the name of the counterparty (but segregated for the benefit of the Company). The amount of this off-balance sheet collateral was   $0   and   $263 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
              (4) 
    The receivable for the return of cash collateral provided by the Company is inclusive of initial margin on exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives and is included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the balance sheet. The amount of cash collateral offset in the table above is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting agreements. At   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company received excess cash collateral of   $89 million   and   $87 million   (including   $0   and   $36 million   off-balance sheet cash collateral held in separate custodial accounts), respectively, and provided excess cash collateral of   $204 million   and   $192 million  , respectively, which is not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation. 
              (5) 
    Securities collateral received by the Company is held in separate custodial accounts and is not recorded on the balance sheet. Subject to certain constraints, the Company is permitted by contract to sell or re-pledge this collateral, but at   December 31, 2015     none   of the collateral had been sold or re-pledged. Securities collateral pledged by the Company is reported in fixed maturity securities on the balance sheet. Subject to certain constraints, the counterparties are permitted by contract to sell or re-pledge this collateral. The amount of securities collateral offset in the table above is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting agreements and cash collateral. At   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company received excess securities collateral with an estimated fair value of   $100 million   and   $395 million  , respectively, for its OTC-bilateral derivatives, which are not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation. At   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company provided excess securities collateral with an estimated fair value of   $150 million   and   $117 million  , respectively, for its OTC-bilateral derivatives,   $315 million   and   $199 million  , respectively, for its OTC-cleared derivatives, and   $224 million   and   $245 million  , respectively, for its exchange-traded derivatives, which are not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation. 
     The Company s collateral arrangements for its OTC-bilateral derivatives generally require the counterparty in a net liability position, after considering the effect of netting agreements, to pledge collateral when the estimated fair value of that counterparty s derivatives reaches a pre-determined threshold. Certain of these arrangements also include credit-contingent provisions that provide for a reduction of these thresholds (on a sliding scale that converges toward zero) in the event of downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company and/or the counterparty. In addition, certain of the Company s netting agreements for derivatives contain provisions that require both the Company and the counterparty to maintain a specific investment grade credit rating from each of Moody s and S P. If a party s credit ratings were to fall below that specific investment grade credit rating, that party would be in violation of these provisions, and the other party to the derivatives could terminate the transactions and demand immediate settlement and payment based on such party s reasonable valuation of the derivatives. 
  The following table presents the estimated fair value of the Company s OTC-bilateral derivatives that are in a net liability position after considering the effect of netting agreements, together with the estimated fair value and balance sheet location of the collateral pledged. The table also presents the incremental collateral that the Company would be required to provide if there was a one notch downgrade in the Company s credit rating at the reporting date or if the Company s credit rating sustained a downgrade to a level that triggered full overnight collateralization or termination of the derivative position at the reporting date. OTC-bilateral derivatives that are not subject to collateral agreements are excluded from this table.

       Embedded Derivatives 
  The Company issues certain products or purchases certain investments that contain embedded derivatives that are required to be separated from their host contracts and accounted for as freestanding derivatives. These host contracts principally include: variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits, including GMWBs, GMABs and certain GMIBs; ceded reinsurance of guaranteed minimum benefits related to certain GMIBs; assumed reinsurance of guaranteed minimum benefits related to GMWBs and GMABs; funding agreements with equity or bond indexed crediting rates; funds withheld on assumed and ceded reinsurance; fixed annuities with equity-indexed returns; and certain debt and equity securities.

   The following table presents changes in estimated fair value related to embedded derivatives: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    The valuation of guaranteed minimum benefits includes a nonperformance risk adjustment. The amounts included in net derivative gains (losses) in connection with this adjustment were   $163 million  ,   $13 million   and   ($952) million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
       10. Fair Value 
    When developing estimated fair values, the Company considers three broad valuation techniques: (i) the market approach, (ii) the income approach, and (iii) the cost approach. The Company determines the most appropriate valuation technique to use, given what is being measured and the availability of sufficient inputs, giving priority to observable inputs. The Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the significant input with the lowest level in its valuation. The input levels are as follows:  
                 Level 1 
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company defines active markets based on average trading volume for equity securities. The size of the bid/ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for fixed maturity securities. 
   
                Level 2 
    Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs can include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other than quoted prices in Level 1, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other significant inputs that are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
   
                Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the determination of estimated fair value of the assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. The Company s ability to sell securities, or the price ultimately realized for these securities, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities. 
  Considerable judgment is often required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding placement in the fair value hierarchy, including those items for which the Company has elected the FVO, are presented below.

    Short-term investments as presented in the tables above differ from the amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheets because certain short-term investments are not measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis. 
              (2) 
    Derivative assets are presented within other invested assets on the consolidated balance sheets and derivative liabilities are presented within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

              (3) 
    Net embedded derivatives within asset host contracts are presented primarily within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets. Net embedded derivatives within liability host contracts are presented within policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , debt and equity securities also included embedded derivatives of   ($220) million   and   ($217) million  , respectively. 
              (4) 
    Investment performance related to separate account assets is fully offset by corresponding amounts credited to contractholders whose liability is reflected within separate account liabilities. Separate account liabilities are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets.

    Trading liabilities are presented within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
       The following describes the valuation methodologies used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. The description includes the valuation techniques and key inputs for each category of assets or liabilities that are classified within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Investments 
  Valuation Controls and Procedures 
  On behalf of the Company s Chief Investment Officer and Chief Financial Officer, a pricing and valuation committee that is independent of the trading and investing functions and comprised of senior management, provides oversight of control systems and valuation policies for securities, mortgage loans and derivatives. On a quarterly basis, this committee reviews and approves new transaction types and markets, ensures that observable market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation, wherever possible, and determines that judgmental valuation adjustments, when applied, are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time. This committee also provides oversight of the selection of independent third party pricing providers and the controls and procedures to evaluate third party pricing. Periodically, the Chief Accounting Officer reports to the Audit Committee of MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors regarding compliance with fair value accounting standards. 
  The Company reviews its valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and revises those methodologies when necessary based on changing market conditions. Assurance is gained on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions, valuation methodologies and compliance with fair value accounting standards through controls designed to ensure valuations represent an exit price. Several controls are utilized, including certain monthly controls, which include, but are not limited to, analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns, comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates, comparing fair value estimates to management s knowledge of the current market, reviewing the bid/ask spreads to assess activity, comparing prices from multiple independent pricing services and ongoing due diligence to confirm that independent pricing services use market-based parameters. The process includes a determination of the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data. The Company ensures that prices received from independent brokers, also referred to herein as  consensus pricing,  represent a reasonable estimate of fair value by considering such pricing relative to the Company s knowledge of the current market dynamics and current pricing for similar financial instruments. While independent non-binding broker quotations are utilized, they are not used for a significant portion of the portfolio. For example, fixed maturity securities priced using independent non-binding broker quotations represent less than   1%   of the total estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities and   7%   of the total estimated fair value of Level 3 fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2015.

   The Company also applies a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value. If prices received from independent pricing services are not considered reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value, independent non-binding broker quotations are obtained, or an internally developed valuation is prepared. Internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value, which reflect internal estimates of liquidity and nonperformance risks, compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services, did not produce material differences in the estimated fair values for the majority of the portfolio; accordingly, overrides were not material. This is, in part, because internal estimates of liquidity and nonperformance risks are generally based on available market evidence and estimates used by other market participants. In the absence of such market-based evidence, management s best estimate is used. 
  Securities, Short-term Investments, Other Investments, Long-term Debt of CSEs   FVO and Trading Liabilities 
  When available, the estimated fair value of these financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most liquid of the Company s securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not involve management s judgment. 
  When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the determination of estimated fair value is based on market standard valuation methodologies, giving priority to observable inputs. The significant inputs to the market standard valuation methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. When observable inputs are not available, the market standard valuation methodologies rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. These unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management s judgment or estimation and cannot be supported by reference to market activity. Even though these inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. 
  The estimated fair value of investments in certain separate accounts included in FVO contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, FVO securities held by CSEs, other investments, long-term debt of CSEs   FVO and trading liabilities is determined on a basis consistent with the methodologies described herein for securities. 
  The valuation of most instruments listed below is determined using independent pricing sources, matrix pricing, discounted cash flow methodologies or other similar techniques that use either observable market inputs or unobservable inputs.

  10. Fair Value (continued) 

   Derivatives 
  The estimated fair value of derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market prices for exchange-traded derivatives, or through the use of pricing models for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives. The determination of estimated fair value, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. The valuation controls and procedures for derivatives are described in    Investments.  
  The significant inputs to the pricing models for most OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Certain OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives may rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. These unobservable inputs may involve significant management judgment or estimation. Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments. 
  Most inputs for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives are mid-market inputs but, in certain cases, liquidity adjustments are made when they are deemed more representative of exit value. Market liquidity, as well as the use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs, may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of the Company s derivatives and could materially affect net income. 
  The credit risk of both the counterparty and the Company are considered in determining the estimated fair value for all OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives, and any potential credit adjustment is based on the net exposure by counterparty after taking into account the effects of netting agreements and collateral arrangements. The Company values its OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives using standard swap curves which may include a spread to the risk-free rate, depending upon specific collateral arrangements. This credit spread is appropriate for those parties that execute trades at pricing levels consistent with similar collateral arrangements. As the Company and its significant derivative counterparties generally execute trades at such pricing levels and hold sufficient collateral, additional credit risk adjustments are not currently required in the valuation process. The Company s ability to consistently execute at such pricing levels is in part due to the netting agreements and collateral arrangements that are in place with all of its significant derivative counterparties. An evaluation of the requirement to make additional credit risk adjustments is performed by the Company each reporting period. 
  Freestanding Derivatives Valuation Techniques and Key Inputs 
  Level 2 
  This level includes all types of derivatives utilized by the Company with the exception of exchange-traded derivatives included within Level 1 and those derivatives with unobservable inputs as described in Level 3. 
  Level 3 
  These valuation methodologies generally use the same inputs as described in the corresponding sections for Level 2 measurements of derivatives. However, these derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.

     Embedded Derivatives 
  Embedded derivatives principally include certain direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity guarantees, equity or bond indexed crediting rates within certain funding agreements and annuity contracts, and those related to funds withheld on ceded reinsurance agreements. Embedded derivatives are recorded at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value reported in net income. 
  The Company issues certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits. GMWBs, GMABs and certain GMIBs contain embedded derivatives, which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder account balances and future policy benefits on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  The Company s actuarial department calculates the fair value of these embedded derivatives, which are estimated as the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees using actuarial and capital market assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. The calculation is based on in-force business, and is performed using standard actuarial valuation software which projects future cash flows from the embedded derivative over multiple risk neutral stochastic scenarios using observable risk-free rates. 
  Capital market assumptions, such as risk-free rates and implied volatilities, are based on market prices for publicly traded instruments to the extent that prices for such instruments are observable. Implied volatilities beyond the observable period are extrapolated based on observable implied volatilities and historical volatilities. Actuarial assumptions, including mortality, lapse, withdrawal and utilization, are unobservable and are reviewed at least annually based on actuarial studies of historical experience. 
  The valuation of these guarantee liabilities includes nonperformance risk adjustments and adjustments for a risk margin related to non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance adjustment is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc. s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. 
    275 

       Table of Contents

  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  10. Fair Value (continued) 

   Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization, premium persistency, partial withdrawal and surrenders. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees. These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in nonperformance risk; and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. 
  The Company ceded the risk associated with certain of the GMIBs previously described. These reinsurance agreements contain embedded derivatives which are included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses) or policyholder benefits and claims depending on the statement of operations classification of the direct risk. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by the Company with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. 
  The estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance is determined based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying assets held by the Company in a reference portfolio backing the funds withheld liability. The estimated fair value of the underlying assets is determined as previously described in    Investments   Securities, Short-term Investments, Other Investments, Long-term Debt of CSEs   FVO and Trading Liabilities.  The estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives is included, along with their funds withheld hosts, in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). Changes in the credit spreads on the underlying assets, interest rates and market volatility may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income. 
  The estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed derivatives contained in certain funding agreements is determined using market standard swap valuation models and observable market inputs, including a nonperformance risk adjustment. The estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives are included, along with their funding agreements host, within policyholder account balances with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). Changes in equity and bond indices, interest rates and the Company s credit standing may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income. 
  The Company issues certain annuity contracts which allow the policyholder to participate in returns from equity indices. These equity indexed features are embedded derivatives which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host fixed annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder account balances on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  The estimated fair value of the embedded equity indexed derivatives, based on the present value of future equity returns to the policyholder using actuarial and present value assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior, is calculated by the Company s actuarial department. The calculation is based on in-force business and uses standard capital market techniques, such as Black-Scholes, to calculate the value of the portion of the embedded derivative for which the terms are set. The portion of the embedded derivative covering the period beyond where terms are set is calculated as the present value of amounts expected to be spent to provide equity indexed returns in those periods. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes the establishment of a risk margin, as well as changes in nonperformance risk.

   Embedded Derivatives Within Asset and Liability Host Contracts 
  Level 3 Valuation Techniques and Key Inputs: 
  Direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits 
  These embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. Valuations are based on option pricing techniques, which utilize significant inputs that may include swap yield curve, currency exchange rates and implied volatilities. These embedded derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Significant unobservable inputs generally include: the extrapolation beyond observable limits of the swap yield curve and implied volatilities, actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior and mortality and the potential variability in policyholder behavior and mortality, nonperformance risk and cost of capital for purposes of calculating the risk margin. 
  Reinsurance ceded on certain guaranteed minimum benefits 
  These embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. The valuation techniques and significant market standard unobservable inputs used in their valuation are similar to those described above in    Direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits  and also include counterparty credit spreads. 
    Transfers between Levels 
  Overall, transfers between levels occur when there are changes in the observability of inputs and market activity. Transfers into or out of any level are assumed to occur at the beginning of the period. 
  Transfers between Levels 1 and 2: 
  For assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value and still held at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , transfers between Levels 1 and 2 were   $203 million   and   $160 million  , respectively. 
  Transfers into or out of Level 3: 
  Assets and liabilities are transferred into Level 3 when a significant input cannot be corroborated with market observable data. This occurs when market activity decreases significantly and underlying inputs cannot be observed, current prices are not available, and/or when there are significant variances in quoted prices, thereby affecting transparency. Assets and liabilities are transferred out of Level 3 when circumstances change such that a significant input can be corroborated with market observable data. This may be due to a significant increase in market activity, a specific event, or one or more significant input(s) becoming observable.

Since this valuation methodology uses a range of inputs across a yield curve to value the derivative, presenting a range is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation. 
              (8) 
    Ranges represent the different correlation factors utilized as components within the valuation methodology. Presenting a range of correlation factors is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation. Increases (decreases) in correlation in isolation will increase (decrease) the significance of the change in valuations. 
              (9) 
    Represents the risk quoted in basis points of a credit default event on the underlying instrument. Credit derivatives with significant unobservable inputs are primarily comprised of written credit default swaps. 
              (10) 
    At both   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , independent non-binding broker quotations were used in the determination of less than   1%   of the total net derivative estimated fair value. 
              (11) 
    Ranges represent the underlying equity volatility quoted in percentage points. Since this valuation methodology uses a range of inputs across multiple volatility surfaces to value the derivative, presenting a range is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation. 
              (12) 
    Changes are based on long U.S. dollar net asset positions and will be inversely impacted for short U.S. dollar net asset positions. 
              (13) 
    Mortality rates vary by age and by demographic characteristics such as gender. Mortality rate assumptions are based on company experience. A mortality improvement assumption is also applied. For any given contract, mortality rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (14) 
    Base lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially calculated guaranteed values and the current policyholder account value, as well as other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. A dynamic lapse function reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value as in the money contracts are less likely to lapse. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower in periods when a surrender charge applies. For any given contract, lapse rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (15) 
    The utilization rate assumption estimates the percentage of contract holders with a GMIB or lifetime withdrawal benefit who will elect to utilize the benefit upon becoming eligible. The rates may vary by the type of guarantee, the amount by which the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value, the contract s withdrawal history and by the age of the policyholder. For any given contract, utilization rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (16) 
    The withdrawal rate represents the percentage of account balance that any given policyholder will elect to withdraw from the contract each year. The withdrawal rate assumption varies by age and duration of the contract, and also by other factors such as benefit type. For any given contract, withdrawal rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. For GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees. For GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value. 
              (17) 
    Long-term equity volatilities represent equity volatility beyond the period for which observable equity volatilities are available. For any given contract, long-term equity volatility rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. 
              (18) 
    Nonperformance risk spread varies by duration and by currency. For any given contract, multiple nonperformance risk spreads will apply, depending on the duration of the cash flow being discounted for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative.

  10. Fair Value (continued) 

   The following is a summary of the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 that are not included in the preceding table. Generally, all other classes of securities classified within Level 3, including those within separate account assets, use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3 securities. This includes matrix pricing and discounted cash flow methodologies, inputs such as quoted prices for identical or similar securities that are less liquid and based on lower levels of trading activity than securities classified in Level 2, as well as independent non-binding broker quotations. The residential mortgage loans   FVO and long-term debt of CSEs   FVO are valued using independent non-binding broker quotations and internal models including matrix pricing and discounted cash flow methodologies using current interest rates. The sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in the significant unobservable inputs for these other assets and liabilities is similar in nature to that described in the preceding table. The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for the more significant assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis and determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are summarized in    Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.

   Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The following table presents information for assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the periods and still held at the reporting dates (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). The estimated fair values for these assets were determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Estimated fair values for impaired mortgage loans are based on independent broker quotations or valuation models using unobservable inputs or, if the loans are in foreclosure or are otherwise determined to be collateral dependent, are based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows. 
              (2) 
    For these cost method investments, estimated fair value is determined from information provided in the financial statements of the underlying entities including NAV data. These investments include private equity and debt funds that typically invest primarily in various strategies including domestic and international leveraged buyout funds; power, energy, timber and infrastructure development funds; venture capital funds; and below investment grade debt and mezzanine debt funds. Distributions will be generated from investment gains, from operating income from the underlying investments of the funds and from liquidation of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated over the next   two   to   10 years  . Unfunded commitments for these investments at both   December 31, 2015   and   2014   were not significant. 
       Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carried at Other Than Fair Value 
  The following tables provide fair value information for financial instruments that are carried on the balance sheet at amounts other than fair value. These tables exclude the following financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income, payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions, short-term debt and those short-term investments that are not securities, such as time deposits, and therefore are not included in the three level hierarchy table disclosed in the    Recurring Fair Value Measurements  section. The estimated fair value of the excluded financial instruments, which are primarily classified in Level 2, approximates carrying value as they are short-term in nature such that the Company believes there is minimal risk of material changes in interest rates or credit quality. All remaining balance sheet amounts excluded from the table below are not considered financial instruments subject to this disclosure.

     Table of Contents  
  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  10. Fair Value (continued) 

   The methods, assumptions and significant valuation techniques and inputs used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are summarized as follows: 
  Mortgage Loans 
  The estimated fair value of mortgage loans is primarily determined by estimating expected future cash flows and discounting them using current interest rates for similar mortgage loans with similar credit risk, or is determined from pricing for similar loans. 
  Policy Loans 
  Policy loans with fixed interest rates are classified within Level 3. The estimated fair values for these loans are determined using a discounted cash flow model applied to groups of similar policy loans determined by the nature of the underlying insurance liabilities. Cash flow estimates are developed by applying a weighted-average interest rate to the outstanding principal balance of the respective group of policy loans and an estimated average maturity determined through experience studies of the past performance of policyholder repayment behavior for similar loans. These cash flows are discounted using current risk-free interest rates with no adjustment for borrower credit risk, as these loans are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of the underlying insurance policy. Policy loans with variable interest rates are classified within Level 2 and the estimated fair value approximates carrying value due to the absence of borrower credit risk and the short time period between interest rate resets, which presents minimal risk of a material change in estimated fair value due to changes in market interest rates. 
  Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership Interests 
  The estimated fair values of these cost method investments are generally based on the Company s share of the NAV as provided in the financial statements of the investees. In certain circumstances, management may adjust the NAV by a premium or discount when it has sufficient evidence to support applying such adjustments. 
  Other Invested Assets 
  These other invested assets are principally comprised of various interest-bearing assets held in foreign subsidiaries and certain amounts due under contractual indemnifications. For the various interest-bearing assets held in foreign subsidiaries, the Company evaluates the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument to determine the appropriate estimated fair values. These estimated fair values were not materially different from the recognized carrying values. 
  Premiums, Reinsurance and Other Receivables 
  Premiums, reinsurance and other receivables are principally comprised of certain amounts recoverable under reinsurance agreements, amounts on deposit with financial institutions to facilitate daily settlements related to certain derivatives and amounts receivable for securities sold but not yet settled. 
  Amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance agreements, which the Company has determined do not transfer significant risk such that they are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting, have been classified as Level 3. The valuation is based on discounted cash flow methodologies using significant unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value is determined using interest rates determined to reflect the appropriate credit standing of the assuming counterparty. 
  The amounts on deposit for derivative settlements, classified within Level 2, essentially represent the equivalent of demand deposit balances and amounts due for securities sold are generally received over short periods such that the estimated fair value approximates carrying value. 
  Other Assets 
  These other assets are principally comprised of a receivable for cash paid to an unaffiliated financial institution under the MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston ( MRC ) collateral financing arrangement described in   Note 13  . The estimated fair value of the receivable for the cash paid to the unaffiliated financial institution under the MRC collateral financing arrangement is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the credit rating of the unaffiliated financial institution.

  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  10. Fair Value (continued) 

   Policyholder Account Balances 
  These policyholder account balances include investment contracts which primarily include certain funding agreements, fixed deferred annuities, modified guaranteed annuities, fixed term payout annuities and total control accounts ( TCA ). The valuation of these investment contracts is based on discounted cash flow methodologies using significant unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value is determined using current market risk-free interest rates adding a spread to reflect the nonperformance risk in the liability. 
  Long-term Debt, Collateral Financing Arrangements and Junior Subordinated Debt Securities 
  The estimated fair values of long-term debt, collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities are principally determined using market standard valuation methodologies.  
  Valuations of instruments classified as Level 2 are based primarily on quoted prices in markets that are not active or using matrix pricing that use standard market observable inputs such as quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market. Instruments valued using discounted cash flow methodologies use standard market observable inputs including market yield curve, duration, call provisions, observable prices and spreads for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues. 
  Valuations of instruments classified as Level 3 are based primarily on discounted cash flow methodologies that utilize unobservable discount rates that can vary significantly based upon the specific terms of each individual arrangement. The determination of estimated fair values of collateral financing arrangements incorporates valuations obtained from the counterparties to the arrangements, as part of the collateral management process. 
  Other Liabilities 
  Other liabilities consist primarily of interest payable, amounts due for securities purchased but not yet settled, and funds withheld amounts payable, which are contractually withheld by the Company in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreements. The Company evaluates the specific terms, facts and circumstances of each instrument to determine the appropriate estimated fair values, which are not materially different from the carrying values, with the exception of certain deposit type reinsurance payables. For such payables, the estimated fair value is determined as the present value of expected future cash flows, which are discounted using an interest rate determined to reflect the appropriate credit standing of the assuming counterparty. 
  Separate Account Liabilities 
  Separate account liabilities represent those balances due to policyholders under contracts that are classified as investment contracts. 
  Separate account liabilities classified as investment contracts primarily represent variable annuities with no significant mortality risk to the Company such that the death benefit is equal to the account balance, funding agreements related to group life contracts and certain contracts that provide for benefit funding. 
  Since separate account liabilities are fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets which are recognized at estimated fair value as described in the section    Recurring Fair Value Measurements,  the value of those assets approximates the estimated fair value of the related separate account liabilities. The valuation techniques and inputs for separate account liabilities are similar to those described for separate account assets.

   11. Goodwill 
    Goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. The goodwill impairment process requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative assessment or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative assessment is an assessment of historical information and relevant events and circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all of its reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. In performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the Company may use a market multiple valuation approach and a discounted cash flow valuation approach. For reporting units which are particularly sensitive to market assumptions, the Company may use additional valuation methodologies to estimate the reporting units  fair values. 
  The market multiple valuation approach utilizes market multiples of companies with similar businesses and the projected operating earnings of the reporting unit. The discounted cash flow valuation approach requires judgments about revenues, operating earnings projections, capital market assumptions and discount rates. The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected operating earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, control premium, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewal business, as well as margins on such business, the level of interest rates, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that the Company believes is appropriate for the respective reporting unit. 
  When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company also considers its market capitalization in relation to the aggregate estimated fair value of its reporting units. The Company applies significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of the Company s reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of its reporting units. 
  The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in the estimated fair value of the Company s reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect the Company s results of operations or financial position. 
  For the 2015 annual goodwill impairment tests, the Company utilized the qualitative assessment for four of its six reporting units and determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any of the reporting units tested using the qualitative assessment was less than its carrying amount and, therefore no further testing was needed for these reporting units. The Company prepared a quantitative impairment test for Retail and EMEA, using both the market multiple and discounted cash flow valuation approaches. The Company determined that the fair values of these reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore goodwill was not impaired.

   Information regarding goodwill by segment, as well as Corporate   Other, was as follows: 

______________ 
            (2) 
    For purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2015, the balance of   $229 million  , of net goodwill in Corporate   Other at December 31, 2014 did not change. This balance resulted from goodwill acquired as part of the 2005 Travelers acquisition and was allocated to business units of the Retail; Group, Voluntary   Worksite Benefits; and Corporate Benefit Funding segments in the amounts of   $34 million  ,   $9 million   and   $186 million  , respectively.  
              (3) 
    See   Note 3   for a discussion of the acquisition of ProVida, which is included in the Latin America segment. 
              (4) 
    In connection with exiting the businesses of MetLife Bank, National Association ( MetLife Bank ), goodwill and the related accumulated impairment were reduced by   $65 million   for the year ended December 31,   2013  .  
              (5) 
    In connection with the sale of MAL, goodwill in the Corporate Benefit Funding reporting unit was reduced by   $60 million   during the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 3. This goodwill was allocated to MAL based on the relative fair values of MAL and the remaining portion of the Corporate Benefit Funding reporting unit.

   12. Long-term and Short-term Debt 
    Long-term and short-term debt outstanding was as follows: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Range of interest rates and weighted average interest rates are for the year ended December 31,   2015  . 
      The aggregate maturities of long-term debt at December 31,   2015   for the next five years and thereafter are   $1.3 billion   in 2016,   $1.0 billion   in 2017,   $1.0 billion   in 2018,   $1.0 billion   in 2019,   $940 million   in 2020 and   $12.7 billion   thereafter. 
  Capital lease obligations are collateralized and rank highest in priority, followed by unsecured senior debt which consists of senior notes and other notes, followed by subordinated debt which consists of junior subordinated debt securities (see Note   14  ). Payments of interest and principal on the Company s surplus notes, which are subordinate to all other obligations at the operating company level and are senior to obligations at MetLife, Inc., may be made only with the prior approval of the insurance department of the state of domicile. Collateral financing arrangements (see Note   13  ) are supported by either surplus notes of subsidiaries or financing arrangements with MetLife, Inc. and, accordingly, have priority consistent with other such obligations. 
  Certain of the Company s debt instruments and committed facilities, as well as its credit facility, contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. The Company believes it was in compliance with all such covenants at December 31,   2015  . 
  Senior Notes   Senior Debt Securities Underlying Common Equity Units 
  In November 2010, in connection with the financing of the acquisition of American Life Insurance Company ( American Life ) and Delaware American Life Insurance Company ( DelAm ), (collectively  ALICO ), MetLife, Inc. issued to ALICO Holdings LLC (now AM Holdings LLC ( AM Holdings ))   $3.0 billion   (estimated fair value of   $3.0 billion  ) of three series of debt securities (the  Series C Debt Securities,  the  Series D Debt Securities,  and the  Series E Debt Securities,  collectively, the  Debt Securities ), which constituted a part of the common equity units more fully described in Note   15  . 
  In October 2014 and September 2013, MetLife, Inc. closed the successful remarketing of senior debt securities underlying the common equity units. The Series E Debt Securities were remarketed in September and October 2014 as   1.903%   Series E senior debt securities Tranche 1 due   December 2017   and   4.721%   Series E senior debt securities Tranche 2 due   December 2044  . The Series D Debt Securities were remarketed in September 2013 as   4.368%   senior debt securities due   September 2023  . The Series C Debt Securities were previously remarketed in 2012. MetLife, Inc. did not receive any proceeds from the remarketings.

  Information related to the collateral financing arrangement associated with the closed block was as follows at:

    Carrying value. 
              (2) 
    Estimated fair value. 
     Interest expense on the collateral financing arrangement was   $20 million  ,   $19 million   and   $20 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, which is included in other expenses. 
  In December 2007, MLIC reinsured a portion of its closed block liabilities to MRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. In connection with this transaction, MRC issued, to investors placed by an unaffiliated financial institution,   $2.5 billion   in aggregate principal amount of   35  -year surplus notes to provide statutory reserve support for the assumed closed block liabilities. Interest on the surplus notes accrues at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus   0.55%  , payable quarterly. The ability of MRC to make interest and principal payments on the surplus notes is contingent upon South Carolina regulatory approval. 
  Simultaneously with the issuance of the surplus notes, MetLife, Inc. entered into an agreement with the unaffiliated financial institution, under which MetLife, Inc. is entitled to the interest paid by MRC on the surplus notes of three-month LIBOR plus   0.55%   in exchange for the payment of three-month LIBOR plus   1.12%  , payable quarterly on such amount as adjusted, as described below. MetLife, Inc. may also be required to pledge collateral or make payments to the unaffiliated financial institution related to any decline in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes. Any such payments are accounted for as a receivable and included in other assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheets and do not reduce the principal amount outstanding of the surplus notes. Such payments, however, reduce the amount of interest payments due from MetLife, Inc. under the agreement. Any payment received from the unaffiliated financial institution reduces the receivable by an amount equal to such payment and also increases the amount of interest payments due from MetLife, Inc. under the agreement. In addition, the unaffiliated financial institution may be required to pledge collateral to MetLife, Inc. related to any increase in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes. MetLife, Inc. may also be required to make a payment to the unaffiliated financial institution in connection with any early termination of this agreement. 
  During 2015, following regulatory approval, MRC repurchased   $57 million   in aggregate principal amount of the surplus notes. Cumulatively, since December 2007, MRC repurchased   $1.2 billion   in aggregate principal amount of the surplus notes. Payments made by the Company in 2015 associated with the repurchases were exclusive of accrued interest on the surplus notes. In connection with the repurchases, the Company received payments in the aggregate amount of   $8 million   from the unaffiliated financial institution, which reduced the amount receivable from the unaffiliated financial institution by   $8 million  . No other payments were made by MetLife, Inc. or received from the unaffiliated financial institution during   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , related to an increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes.

  13. Collateral Financing Arrangements (continued) 

   A majority of the proceeds from the offering of the surplus notes was placed in a trust, which is consolidated by the Company, to support MRC s statutory obligations associated with the assumed closed block liabilities. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, MRC transferred   $30 million   and   $467 million  , respectively, out of the trust to its general account. No such transfers were made during the year ended December 31,   2013  . The assets are principally invested in fixed maturity securities and are presented as such within the Company s consolidated balance sheets, with the related income included within net investment income in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.

     Interest expense on the collateral financing arrangement was   $28 million  ,   $27 million   and   $28 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, which is included in other expenses. 
  In May 2007, MetLife, Inc. and MRSC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., entered into a   30  -year collateral financing arrangement with an unaffiliated financial institution that provides up to   $3.5 billion   of statutory reserve support for MRSC associated with reinsurance obligations under intercompany reinsurance agreements. Such statutory reserves are associated with ULSG and are required under U.S. Valuation of Life Policies Model Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation A-XXX). Proceeds from the collateral financing arrangement were placed in trusts to support MRSC s statutory obligations associated with the reinsurance of secondary guarantees. The trusts are VIEs which are consolidated by the Company. The unaffiliated financial institution is entitled to the return on the investment portfolio held by the trusts. The assets are principally invested in fixed maturity securities and are presented as such within the Company s balance sheets, with the related income included within net investment income in the Company s statements of operations. The collateral financing arrangement may be extended by agreement of MetLife, Inc. and the unaffiliated financial institution on each anniversary of the closing. 
  In connection with the collateral financing arrangement, MetLife, Inc. entered into an agreement with the same unaffiliated financial institution under which MetLife, Inc. is entitled to the return on the investment portfolio held by the trusts established in connection with this collateral financing arrangement in exchange for the payment of a stated rate of return to the unaffiliated financial institution of three-month LIBOR plus   0.70%  , payable quarterly. MetLife, Inc. may also be required to make payments to the unaffiliated financial institution, for deposit into the trusts, related to any decline in the estimated fair value of the assets held by the trusts, as well as amounts outstanding upon maturity or early termination of the collateral financing arrangement. During   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  ,   no   payments were made or received by MetLife, Inc. Cumulatively, since May 2007, MetLife, Inc. has contributed a total of   $680 million   as a result of declines in the estimated fair value of the assets in the trusts, all of which was deposited into the trusts. 
  In addition, MetLife, Inc. may be required to pledge collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution under this agreement. At both December 31,   2015   and   2014  , MetLife, Inc. had pledged   no   collateral under this agreement.

   14. Junior Subordinated Debt Securities 
    Outstanding Junior Subordinated Debt Securities 
  Outstanding junior subordinated debt securities, and exchangeable surplus trust securities which MetLife, Inc. will exchange for junior subordinated debt securities prior to redemption or repayment, were as follows: 
   
 ______________ 
           (1) 
    Prior to the scheduled redemption date, interest is payable semiannually in arrears. 
              (2) 
    In the event the securities are not redeemed on or before the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue after such date at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus the indicated margin, payable quarterly in arrears. 
              (3) 
    MetLife Capital Trust X and MetLife Capital Trust IV are VIEs which are consolidated in the financial statements of the Company. The securities issued by these entities are exchangeable surplus trust securities, which will be exchanged for a like amount of MetLife, Inc. s junior subordinated debt securities on the scheduled redemption date; mandatorily under certain circumstances, and at any time upon MetLife, Inc. exercising its option to redeem the securities. 
     In connection with each of the securities described above, MetLife, Inc. may redeem or may cause the redemption of the securities (i) in whole or in part, at any time on or after the date five years prior to the scheduled redemption date at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or in part, prior to the date five years prior to the scheduled redemption date at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. MetLife, Inc. also has the right to, and in certain circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the securities for a period up to   10 years  . Interest compounds during such periods of deferral. If interest is deferred for more than five consecutive years, MetLife, Inc. is required to use proceeds from the sale of its common stock or warrants on common stock to satisfy this interest payment obligation. In connection with each of the securities described above, MetLife, Inc. entered into a separate replacement capital covenant ( RCC ). As part of each RCC, MetLife, Inc. agreed that it will not repay, redeem, or purchase the securities on or before a date 10 years prior to the final maturity date of each issuance, unless, subject to certain limitations, it has received cash proceeds during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement securities. Each RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including an acceleration of the applicable securities due to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCCs are not intended for the benefit of holders of the securities and may not be enforced by them. Rather, each RCC is for the benefit of the holders of a designated series of MetLife, Inc. s other indebtedness (the  Covered Debt ). Initially, the Covered Debt for each of the securities described above was MetLife, Inc. s   5.700%   senior notes due   2035   (the  Senior Notes ). As a result of the issuance of MetLife, Inc. s   10.750%   Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due   2069   (the  10.750% JSDs ), the 10.750% JSDs became the Covered Debt with respect to, and in accordance with, the terms of the RCC relating to MetLife, Inc. s   6.40%   Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due   2066  . The Senior Notes continue to be the Covered Debt with respect to, and in accordance with, the terms of the RCCs relating to each of MetLife Capital Trust IV s   7.875%   Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities, MetLife Capital Trust X s   9.250%   Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities and the 10.750% JSDs. MetLife, Inc. also entered into a replacement capital obligation which will commence during the six month period prior to the scheduled redemption date of each of the securities described above and under which MetLife, Inc. must use reasonable commercial efforts to raise replacement capital to permit repayment of the securities through the issuance of certain qualifying capital securities. 
  Interest expense on outstanding junior subordinated debt securities was   $258 million   for each of the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , which is included in other expenses.

   15. Common Equity Units 
    In connection with the financing of the acquisition of ALICO in   November 2010  , MetLife, Inc. issued to AM Holdings   40.0 million   common equity units with an aggregate stated amount at issuance of   $3.0 billion   and an estimated fair value of   $3.2 billion  . Each common equity unit had an initial stated amount of   $75   per unit and initially consisted of: (i) three purchase contracts (the Series C Purchase Contracts, the Series D Purchase Contracts and the Series E Purchase Contracts and, together, the  Purchase Contracts ), obligating the holder to purchase, on a subsequent settlement date, a variable number of shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, for a purchase price of   $25   (  $75   in the aggregate); and (ii) a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in each of three series of Debt Securities issued by MetLife, Inc., each series of Debt Securities having an aggregate principal amount of   $1.0 billion  . On March 8, 2011, AM Holdings sold, in a public offering, all the common equity units it received as consideration from MetLife in connection with the acquisition of ALICO. 
  As discussed in Note 12, in October 2014, September 2013 and October 2012, MetLife, Inc. closed the successful remarketings of senior debt securities underlying the common equity units. Most holders of the common equity units used the remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under the applicable Purchase Contracts. The subsequent settlement of the Purchase Contracts provided proceeds to MetLife, Inc. of   $1.0 billion   in each of October 2014, September 2013 and October 2012 in exchange for shares of MetLife, Inc. s common stock.   See Note 16.

           (1) 
    As discussed below, MetLife, Inc. repurchased or redeemed and canceled the 6.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (the  Series B preferred stock ) in 2015. On November 3, 2015, MetLife, Inc. filed a Certificate of Elimination (the  Certificate of Elimination ) of 6.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to eliminate all references to the Series B preferred stock in MetLife, Inc. s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the  Certificate of Incorporation ), including the related Certificate of Designations. As a result of the filing of the Certificate of Elimination, MetLife, Inc. s Certificate of Incorporation was amended to eliminate all references therein to the Series B preferred stock, and the shares that were designated to such series were returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, par value   $0.01   per share, of MetLife, Inc., without designation as to series. 
     In June 2015, MetLife, Inc. issued   1,500,000   shares of   5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate   Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C (the "Series C preferred stock"), with a   $0.01   par value per share and a liquidation preference of   $1,000   per share, for aggregate proceeds of   $1.5 billion  . In connection with the offering of the Series C preferred stock, MetLife, Inc. incurred   $17 million   of issuance costs which have been recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.

   In June 2015, MetLife, Inc. conducted a tender offer for up to   59,850,000   of its   60,000,000   shares of Series B preferred stock, liquidation preference   $25   per share, at a purchase price of   $25   per share, plus an amount equal to accrued, unpaid and undeclared dividends from, and including, June 15, 2015 to, but excluding, June 29, 2015, the settlement date of the tender offer. In June 2015, MetLife, Inc. also delivered a notice of redemption to the holders of the Series B preferred stock, pursuant to which it would redeem any shares of Series B preferred stock not purchased by it in the tender offer at a redemption price of   $25   per share, without any payment for accrued, unpaid and undeclared dividends on the Series B preferred stock from, and including, June 15, 2015 to, but excluding, July 1, 2015, the redemption date. On June 29, 2015, MetLife, Inc. repurchased and canceled   37,192,413   shares of Series B preferred stock in the tender offer for   $932 million   in cash. On July 1, 2015, MetLife, Inc. redeemed and canceled the remaining   22,807,587   shares of Series B preferred stock not tendered in the tender offer for an aggregate redemption price of   $570 million   in cash. In connection with the tender offer and redemption, MetLife, Inc. recognized a preferred stock repurchase premium of   $42 million   (calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the Series B preferred stock and the total amount paid by MetLife, Inc. to the holders of the Series B preferred stock in connection with the tender offer and redemption), which was reflected as a reduction to retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet. 
  The outstanding preferred stock ranks senior to MetLife, Inc. s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. Holders of the outstanding preferred stock are entitled to receive dividend payments only when, as and if declared by MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board. Dividends on the preferred stock are not cumulative or mandatory. Accordingly, if dividends are not declared on the preferred stock of the applicable series for any dividend period, then any accrued dividends for that dividend period will cease to accrue and be payable. If a dividend is not declared before the dividend payment date for any such dividend period, MetLife, Inc. will have no obligation to pay dividends accrued for such dividend period whether or not dividends are declared for any future period. No dividends may be paid or declared on MetLife, Inc. s common stock (or any other securities ranking junior to the preferred stock) and MetLife, Inc. may not purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire its common stock (or other such junior stock) unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of preferred stock, and any parity stock, have been declared and paid or provided for. If dividends are declared on MetLife, Inc. s Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the  Series A preferred stock ), they will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an annual rate of the greater of:   (i) 1.00% above three-month LIBOR on the related LIBOR determination date; or (ii) 4.00%  . If dividends are declared on the Series C preferred stock for any dividend period, they are calculated on a non-cumulative basis at a fixed rate per annum of   5.25%   from the date of original issue to, but excluding, June 15, 2020, and will be calculated at a floating rate per annum equal to   three-month LIBOR plus 3.575%   on the related LIBOR determination date from and after June 15, 2020. Dividends on the Series C preferred stock for any dividend period are payable, if declared, semi-annually in arrears on the 15th day of June and December of each year commencing on December 15, 2015 and ending on June 15, 2020, and thereafter quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of September, December, March and June of each year. Information on payments of dividends on the Series B preferred stock is set forth in the table below. 
  MetLife, Inc. is prohibited from declaring dividends on the outstanding preferred stock if it fails to meet specified capital adequacy, net income and stockholders  equity levels. Beginning on January 1, 2019, MetLife, Inc. will no longer be subject to such limitations with respect to the Series C preferred stock.   See    Dividend Restrictions   MetLife, Inc.  
  Holders of the preferred stock do not have voting rights except in certain circumstances, including where the dividends have not been paid for an equivalent of six or more dividend payment periods whether or not those periods are consecutive. Under such circumstances, the holders of the preferred stock have certain voting rights with respect to members of the Board of Directors of MetLife, Inc. 
  The preferred stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase fund or similar provisions. The Series A preferred stock is redeemable at MetLife, Inc. s option in whole or in part, at a redemption price of   $25   per share of preferred stock, plus declared and unpaid dividends. MetLife, Inc. may, at its option, redeem the Series C preferred stock, (i) in whole but not in part, at any time prior to June 15, 2020, within 90 days after the occurrence of a  regulatory capital event,  and (ii) in whole or in part, from time to time, on or after June 15, 2020, in each case, at a redemption price equal to   $1,000   per Series C preferred share, plus an amount equal to any dividends per share that have accrued but not been declared and paid for the then-current dividend period to, but excluding, such redemption date. A  regulatory capital event  could occur as a result of a change or proposed change in capital adequacy rules (or the interpretation or application thereof) that would apply to MetLife, Inc. from rules (or the interpretation or application thereof) in effect with respect to bank holding companies as of June 1, 2015 that would create a more than insubstantial risk, as determined by MetLife, Inc., that the Series C preferred stock would not be treated as  Tier 1 Capital  or as capital with attributes similar to those of Tier 1 Capital.

As part of each such RCC, MetLife, Inc. agreed that it will not repay, redeem or purchase the preferred stock on or before December 31, 2018, unless, subject to certain limitations, it has received proceeds during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement securities. The repurchase and redemption of Series B preferred stock as described above was in compliance with the terms of the applicable RCC. The RCC is, in each case, for the benefit of the holders of the related covered debt, which is currently MetLife, Inc. s 10.750% JSDs. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including the date on which MetLife, Inc. has no series of outstanding eligible debt securities.

  Under the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2005 Stock Plan ) and the MetLife, Inc. 2015 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2015 Stock Plan ), awards granted to employees and agents may be in the form of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Share Units, Cash-Based Awards and Stock-Based Awards (each, as applicable, as defined in the 2005 Stock Plan and 2015 Stock Plan with reference to shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock ( Shares )). Awards under the 2005 Stock Plan and 2015 Stock Plan were outstanding at   December 31, 2015  . All awards in   2015   were granted under the 2015 Stock Plan. 
  Awards settled in Shares (and Stock Option exercises, if any) under the 2005 Stock Plan or 2015 Stock Plan settled in Shares are satisfied through the issuance of Shares held in treasury by MetLife, Inc. or by the issuance of new Shares. Awards that are payable in Shares and have become due may, in some circumstances, be deferred for issuance at a later date ( Deferred Shares ).  
  The aggregate number of Shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Stock Plan at   December 31, 2015   was equal to: 
               
    Shares utilized under the 2005 Stock Plan or 2015 Stock Plan that are or were recovered since the 2015 Stock Plan became effective on January 1, 2015 due to: (i) termination of the award by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, lapse, or otherwise without the issuance of Shares; (ii) settlement of the award in cash either in lieu of Shares or otherwise; (iii) exchange of the award for awards not involving Shares; (iv) payment of the exercise price of a Stock Option, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to an award, satisfied by tendering Shares to MetLife, Inc. (by either actual delivery or by attestation); (v) satisfaction of tax withholding requirements with respect to an award satisfied by MetLife, Inc. withholding Shares otherwise issuable; and (vi) the payout of the 2012-2014 Performance Shares in 2015 at a performance factor of   101%   rather than the maximum performance factor of   175%   (  4,475,737   Shares), less; 
                
    Shares covered by awards granted under the 2015 Stock Plan since it became effective on January 1, 2015, including Performance Shares assuming future payout at maximum performance factor, and Shares covered by imputed reinvested dividends credited in 2015 on Deferred Shares owed to employees or agents (  4,380,101   Shares). 
     If a Share-settled Stock Appreciation Right were to be granted under the 2015 Stock Plan and were to be exercised, only the number of Shares issued, net of the Shares tendered, if any, would be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the 2015 Stock Plan. 
  Each Share issued under the 2005 Stock Plan in connection with a Stock Option reduces the number of Shares remaining for issuance under that plan by   one  , and each Share issued under the 2005 Stock Plan in connection with awards other than Stock Options reduces the number of Shares remaining for issuance under that plan by   1.179   Shares (the  2005 Stock Plan Share Award Ratio ). For this purpose, any Shares issued pursuant to any Share-settled Stock Appreciation Rights that had been granted under the 2005 Stock Plan would have had (or have) the same effect as Shares issued pursuant to Stock Options. However, no Share-settled Stock Appreciation Rights were granted under the 2005 Stock Plan. Shares related to awards under the 2005 Stock Plan that are recovered, and therefore authorized for issuance under the 2015 Stock Plan, are recovered with consideration of the 2005 Stock Plan Share Award Ratio. 
  Each Share that will or may be issued under the 2015 Stock Plan reduces the number of Shares remaining for issuance under that plan by one. 
  Compensation expense related to awards under the 2005 Stock Plan or 2015 Stock Plan is recognized based on the number of awards expected to vest, which represents the awards granted less expected forfeitures over the life of the award, as estimated at the date of grant. Unless a material deviation from the assumed forfeiture rate is observed during the term in which the awards are expensed, any adjustment necessary to reflect differences in actual experience is recognized in the period the award becomes payable or exercisable.

   Compensation expense related to awards under the 2005 Stock Plan is principally related to the issuance of Stock Options, Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units. Under the 2015 Stock Plan, compensation expense principally relates to Stock Options, Unit Options, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Units. The majority of the awards granted each year under the 2005 Stock Plan and 2015 Stock Plan were made in the first quarter of each year. 
  Deferred Shares payable to employees or agents relate to awards under the 2005 Stock Plan, 2015 Stock Plan, or earlier applicable plans equaled   1,765,120   Shares at   December 31, 2015  .   
  Certain stock-based awards provide solely for cash settlement based in whole or in part on the price of Shares or changes in the price of Shares ( Phantom Stock-Based Awards ). Such awards have been made under the MetLife, Inc. International Unit Option Incentive Plan, the MetLife International Performance Unit Incentive Plan, and the MetLife International Restricted Unit Incentive Plan prior to 2015, and under the 2015 Stock Plan in 2015. 
  Description of Plans for Non-Management Director   General Terms 
  Under the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Non-Management Director Stock Compensation Plan (the  2005 Director Stock Plan ) and MetLife, Inc. 2015 Non-Management Director Stock Compensation Plan (the  2015 Director Stock Plan ), awards granted may be in the form of nonqualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, or Stock-Based Awards (each, as applicable, as defined in the 2005 Director Stock Plan and 2015 Director Stock Plan with reference to Shares) to non-management Directors of MetLife, Inc. The only awards made under the 2005 Director Stock Plan and 2015 Director Stock Plan through   December 31, 2015   vested immediately, thus, no awards under the 2005 Director Stock Plan or 2015 Director Stock Plan remained outstanding at   December 31, 2015  .  
  Awards settled in Shares (and Stock Option exercises, if any) under the 2015 Director Stock Plan are satisfied through the issuance of Shares held in treasury by MetLife, Inc. or by the issuance of new Shares. 
  The aggregate number of Shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Director Stock Plan at   December 31, 2015   was equal to: 
              
    Shares covered by awards granted under the 2015 Director Stock Plan since it became effective     and Shares covered by imputed reinvested dividends credited in 2015 on Deferred Shares owed to Directors (  33,684     Shares). 
     Any Shares utilized under the 2005 Director Stock Plan or 2015 Director Stock Plan that were to be recovered due to (i) termination of the award by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, lapse, or otherwise without the issuance of Shares; (ii) settlement of the award in cash either in lieu of Shares or otherwise; (iii) exchange of the award for awards not involving Shares; and (iv) payment of the exercise price of a Stock Option, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to an award, satisfied by tendering Shares to MetLife, Inc. (by either actual delivery or by attestation) would be available for issuance under the 2015 Director Stock Plan. In addition, if a Share-settled Stock Appreciation Right were to be granted under the 2015 Director Stock Plan, and was exercised, only the number of Shares issued, net of the Shares tendered, if any, would be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the 2015 Director Stock Plan. 
  Each Share that will or may be issued under the 2015 Director Stock Plan reduces the number of Shares remaining for issuance under that plan by one. 
  Compensation expense related to awards under the 2015 Director Stock Plan is recognized based on the number of Shares awarded. The only awards made under the 2005 Director Stock Plan and under the 2015 Director Stock Plan through   December 31, 2015   were Stock-Based Awards that vested immediately. The majority of the awards granted in   2015   under the 2015 Director Stock Plan were made in the second quarter of   2015  . 
  Deferred Shares payable to Directors relate to awards under the 2005 Director Stock Plan, 2015 Director Stock Plan, or earlier applicable plans equaled   166,102   Shares at   December 31, 2015  .

Equity Awards 
  Stock Options 
  Stock Options are the contingent right of award holders to purchase Shares at a stated price for a limited time. All Stock Options have an exercise price equal to the closing price of a Share reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, and have a maximum term of   10   years. The vast majority of Stock Options granted has become or will become exercisable at a rate of one-third of each award on each of the first   three   anniversaries of the grant date. Other Stock Options have become or will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who meet specified age and service criteria and in certain other limited circumstances.

   A summary of the activity related to Stock Options was as follows: 

______________ 
   The fair value of Stock Options is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. Significant assumptions used in the Company s binomial lattice model are further described below. The assumptions include: expected volatility of the price of Shares; risk-free rate of return; dividend yield on Shares; exercise multiple; and the post-vesting termination rate. 
  Expected volatility is based upon an analysis of historical prices of Shares and call options on Shares traded on the open market. The Company uses a weighted-average of the implied volatility for publicly-traded call options with the longest remaining maturity nearest to the money as of each valuation date and the historical volatility, calculated using monthly closing prices of Shares. The Company chose a monthly measurement interval for historical volatility as this interval reflects the Company s view that employee option exercise decisions are based on longer-term trends in the price of the underlying Shares rather than on daily price movements. 
  The binomial lattice model used by the Company incorporates different risk-free rates based on the imputed forward rates for U.S. Treasury Strips for each year over the contractual term of the option. The table below presents the full range of rates that were used for options granted during the respective periods. 
  Dividend yield is determined based on historical dividend distributions compared to the price of the underlying Shares as of the valuation date and held constant over the life of the Stock Option. 
  The binomial lattice model used by the Company incorporates the contractual term of the Stock Options. The model also factors in expected exercise behavior and a post-vesting termination rate, or the rate at which vested options are exercised or expire prematurely due to termination of employment. From these factors, the model derives an expected life of the Stock Option. The exercise behavior in the model is a multiple that reflects the ratio of exercise price to the strike price of the Stock Option at which holders are expected to exercise. The exercise multiple is derived from actual historical exercise activity. The post-vesting termination rate is determined from actual historical exercise experience and expiration activity under the Incentive Plans.

   The following table presents the weighted average assumptions, with the exception of risk-free rate, which is expressed as a range, used to determine the fair value of Stock Options issued: 

The following table presents a summary of Stock Option exercise activity: 

Performance Shares 
  Performance Shares are units that, if they vest, are multiplied by a performance factor to produce a number of final Performance Shares which are payable in Shares. Performance Shares are accounted for as equity awards. They are not credited with dividend-equivalents for actual dividends paid on Shares during the performance period. Performance Share awards normally vest in their entirety at the end of the three-year performance period. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who meet specified age and in certain other limited circumstances. 
  For awards granted prior to the January 1, 2013     December 31,   2015 performance period, vested Performance Shares are multiplied by a performance factor of   0%   to   200%   based on MetLife, Inc. s adjusted income, total shareholder return, and performance in change in annual net operating earnings and total shareholder return compared to the performance of its competitors, each measured with respect to the applicable three-year performance period or portions thereof. The estimated fair value of Performance Shares is based upon the closing price of a Share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends to be paid on that stock during the performance period. The performance factor for the January 1, 2012   December 31, 2014 performance period was   101%  . 
  For awards granted for the January 1, 2013     December 31, 2015   and later performance periods in progress through   December 31, 2015  , the vested Performance Shares will be multiplied by a performance factor of   0%   to   175%  . Assuming that MetLife, Inc. has met threshold performance goals related to its adjusted income or total shareholder return, the MetLife, Inc. Compensation Committee will determine the performance factor in its discretion. In doing so, the Compensation Committee may consider MetLife, Inc. s total shareholder return relative to the performance of its competitors and operating return on MetLife, Inc. s common stockholder s equity relative to its financial plan. The estimated fair value of Performance Shares will be remeasured each quarter until they become payable.

   Restricted Stock Units 
  Restricted Stock Units are units that, if they vest, are payable in an equal number of Shares. Restricted Stock Units are accounted for as equity awards. They are not credited with dividend-equivalents for dividends paid on Shares. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of Restricted Stock Units is based upon the closing price of Shares on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends to be paid on that stock. 
  The vast majority of Restricted Stock Units normally vest in thirds on the first three anniversaries of their grant date. Other Restricted Stock Units normally vest in their entirety on the third anniversary of their grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who meet specified age and service criteria and in certain other limited circumstances. 
  The following table presents a summary of Performance Share and Restricted Stock Unit activity: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Includes both Shares paid and Deferred Shares for later payment. 
     Performance Share amounts above represent aggregate initial target awards and do not reflect potential increases or decreases resulting from the performance factor determined after the end of the respective performance periods. At   December 31, 2015  , the   three   year performance period for the 2013 Performance Share grants was completed, but the performance factor had not yet been calculated. Included in the immediately preceding table are   1,592,641   outstanding Performance Shares to which the 2013   2015 performance factor will be applied. 
  Liability Awards (Phantom Stock-Based Awards) 
  Certain MetLife international subsidiaries have a liability for Phantom Stock-Based Awards in the form of Unit Options, Restricted Units, and/or Performance Units. These Share-based cash settled awards are recorded as liabilities until payout is made. Unlike Share-settled awards, which have a fixed grant-date fair value, the fair value of unsettled or unvested liability awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of one Share. The liability and corresponding expense are adjusted accordingly until the award is settled. 
  Unit Options 
  Each Unit Option is the contingent right of the holder to receive a cash payment equal to the closing price of a Share on the surrender date, less the closing price on the grant date, if the difference is greater than zero. The vast majority of Unit Options has become or will become eligible for surrender at a rate of one-third of each award on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Other Unit Options have become or will become eligible for surrender on the third anniversary of the grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who meet specified age and service criteria and in certain other limited circumstances.

   Restricted Units 
  Restricted Units are units that, if they vest, are payable in cash equal to the closing price of a Share on the last day of the restriction period. The vast majority of Restricted Units normally vest in their entirety on the third anniversary of their grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees meet specified age and service criteria and in certain other limited circumstances. Restricted Units are accounted for as liability awards. They are not credited with dividend-equivalents for actual dividends paid on Shares during the performance period.  
  Performance Units 
  Performance Units are units that, if they vest, are multiplied by a performance factor to produce a number of final Performance Units which are payable in cash equal to the closing price of a Share on a date following the last day of the three-year performance period. The performance factor for the Performance Units for any given period is determined on the identical basis as the performance factor for Performance Shares for the same performance period. Performance Units are accounted for as liability awards. They are not credited with dividend-equivalents for actual dividends paid on Shares during the performance period. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of Performance Units is based upon the closing price of a Share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends to be paid on that stock during the performance period. 
  See    Equity Awards   Performance Shares  for a discussion of the Performance Shares vesting period and award calculation, which is also used for Performance Units. 
  The following table presents a summary of Liability Awards activity: 

Statutory Equity and Income 
  The states of domicile of   MetLife, Inc  . s U.S. insurance subsidiaries impose risk-based capital ( RBC ) requirements that were developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ). American Life does not write business in Delaware or any other domestic state and, as such, is exempt from RBC requirements by Delaware law. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company s total adjusted capital, calculated in the manner prescribed by the NAIC ( TAC ) to its authorized control level RBC, calculated in the manner prescribed by the NAIC ( ACL RBC ), based on the statutory-based filed financial statements. Companies below specific trigger levels or ratios are classified by their respective levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The minimum level of TAC before corrective action commences is twice ACL RBC ( Company Action Level RBC ). While not required by or filed with insurance regulators, the Company also calculates an internally defined combined RBC ratio ( Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio ), which is determined by dividing the sum of TAC for   MetLife, Inc.   s principal U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life, by the sum of Company Action Level RBC for such subsidiaries. The Company s Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio was   in excess of 390%   at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. In addition, all non-exempted U.S. insurance subsidiaries individually exceeded Company Action Level RBC for all periods presented.

   MetLife, Inc.   s foreign insurance operations are regulated by applicable authorities of the countries in which each entity operates and are subject to minimum capital and solvency requirements in those countries before corrective action commences. At December 31,   2015   and   2014  , the adjusted capital of American Life s insurance subsidiary in Japan, the Company s largest foreign insurance operation, was   in excess of four times the 200% solvency margin ratio   that would require corrective action. Excluding Japan, the aggregate required capital and surplus of the Company s other foreign insurance operations was   $2.8 billion   and the aggregate actual regulatory capital and surplus of such operations was   $7.1 billion   as of the date of the most recent required capital adequacy calculation for each jurisdiction. Each of those other foreign insurance operations exceeded minimum capital and solvency requirements of their respective countries for all periods presented. 
  MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries prepare statutory-basis financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of domicile or applicable foreign jurisdiction. The NAIC has adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles ( Statutory Codification ). Statutory Codification is intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to state insurance departments. However, statutory accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws and permitted practices. Modifications by the various state insurance departments may impact the effect of Statutory Codification on the statutory capital and surplus of   MetLife, Inc.   s U.S. insurance subsidiaries. 
  Statutory accounting principles differ from GAAP primarily by charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions, reporting surplus notes as surplus instead of debt and valuing securities on a different basis. 
  In addition, certain assets are not admitted under statutory accounting principles and are charged directly to surplus. The most significant assets not admitted by the Company are net deferred income tax assets resulting from temporary differences between statutory accounting principles basis and tax basis not expected to reverse and become recoverable within three years. Further, statutory accounting principles do not give recognition to purchase accounting adjustments. 
  MetLife, Inc. s U.S. insurance subsidiaries have no material state prescribed accounting practices, except as described below. 
  New York has adopted certain prescribed accounting practices, primarily consisting of the continuous Commissioners  Annuity Reserve Valuation Method, which impacts deferred annuities, and the New York Special Consideration Letter, which mandates certain assumptions in asset adequacy testing. The collective impact of these prescribed accounting practices decreased the statutory capital and surplus of MLIC for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 by an amount of   $1.2 billion   and   $2.3 billion  , respectively, in excess of the amount of the decrease had capital and surplus been measured under NAIC guidance. 
  American Life calculates its policyholder reserves on insurance written in each foreign jurisdiction in accordance with the reserve standards required by such jurisdiction. American Life is not required to quantify the impact to its statutory capital and surplus as a result of applying this prescribed practice to its branch operations. Additionally, American Life s insurance subsidiaries are valued based on each respective subsidiary s underlying local statutory equity, adjusted in a manner consistent with the reporting prescribed for its branch operations. This valuation basis resulted in lower statutory capital and surplus of   $1.8 billion   and   $2.8 billion   for the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, than if the insurance subsidiaries were valued under NAIC guidance. 
  The Delaware Department of Insurance approved two statutory accounting permitted practices for MetLife Insurance Company USA ( MetLife USA ). For December 31, 2013, MetLife USA applied a U.S. GAAP reserving methodology for certain foreign blocks of business held by Exeter Reassurance Company, Ltd. ( Exeter ) prior to the merger  s into MetLife USA of certain of its affiliates, including Exeter, and a subsidiary  . These blocks of business were recaptured by the counterparties prior to these mergers and are, therefore, not included in MetLife USA s statutory reserves as of December 31, 2014. In addition, the Delaware Department of Insurance granted permission for MetLife USA not to calculate, record or disclose the effect of this permitted practice on statutory surplus and net income f  or the year ended December 31, 2013  . 
  The tables below present amounts from   MetLife, Inc.   s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which are derived from the statutory basis financial statements as filed with the insurance regulators.

   Statutory net income (loss) was as follows:

The Company s domestic captive life reinsurance subsidiaries, which reinsure risks including the closed block, level premium term life and ULSG assumed from other MetLife subsidiaries, have no state prescribed accounting practices, except for MetLife Reinsurance Company of Vermont ( MRV ) and MetLife Reinsurance Company of Delaware ( MRD ). MRV, with the explicit permission of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Vermont, has included, as admitted assets, the value of letters of credit serving as collateral for reinsurance credit taken by various affiliated cedants, in connection with reinsurance agreements entered into between MRV and the various affiliated cedants, which resulted in higher statutory capital and surplus of   $6.0 billion   for both the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  . MRV s RBC would have triggered a regulatory event without the use of the state prescribed practice. MRD, with the explicit permission of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Delaware, has included, as admitted assets, the value of letters of credit issued to MRD, which resulted in higher statutory capital and surplus of   $200 million   and   $75 million   for the years ended December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. MRD s RBC would not have triggered a regulatory event without the use of the state prescribed practice. The combined statutory net income (loss) of   MetLife, Inc.   s domestic captive life reinsurance subsidiaries was   ($336) million  ,   ($320) million   and   ($612) million   for the years ended December   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, and the combined statutory capital and surplus, including the aforementioned prescribed practice, was   $5.0 billion   and   $5.2 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.

   Dividend Restrictions 
  Insurance Operations 
  The table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid by MetLife, Inc. s primary insurance subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and dividends paid: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Reflects dividend amounts that may be paid during 2016 without prior regulatory approval. However, because dividend tests may be based on dividends previously paid over rolling 12-month periods, if paid before a specified date during 2016, some or all of such dividends may require regulatory approval. 
              (2) 
    Reflects all amounts paid, including those requiring regulatory approval. 
              (3) 
    As discussed below, the New York Insurance Law was amended, permitting MLIC to pay dividends without prior regulatory approval under one of two alternative formulations beginning in 2016. The dividend amount that MLIC may pay during 2016 under the new formulation is reflected in the table above. 
              (4) 
    During December 2014, MLIC distributed shares of an affiliate to MetLife, Inc. as an in-kind dividend of   $113 million  . 
              (5) 
    Prior to the mergers into MetLife USA of certain of its affiliates and a subsidiary, Exeter paid dividends of   $155 million   on its preferred stock. In August 2014, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut redeemed for   $1.4 billion   and retired   4,595,317   shares of its common stock owned by MetLife Investors Group LLC ( MLIG ). Following the redemption, in August 2014, MLIG paid a dividend of   $1.4 billion   to MetLife, Inc. In November 2014, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut changed its name to MetLife Insurance Company USA. MetLife USA did not pay dividends in 2014. 
     Effective for dividends paid during 2016 and going forward, the New York Insurance Law was amended permitting MLIC, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay stockholder dividends to MetLife, Inc. in any calendar year based on either of two standards. Under one standard, MLIC is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay dividends out of earned surplus (defined as positive  unassigned funds (surplus)  excluding 85% of the change in net unrealized capital gains or losses (less capital gains tax), for the immediately preceding calendar year), in an amount up to the greater of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains), not to exceed 30% of surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year. In addition, under this standard, MLIC may not, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, pay any dividends in any calendar year immediately following a calendar year for which its net gain from operations, excluding realized capital gains, was negative. Under the second standard, if dividends are paid out of other than earned surplus, MLIC may, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, pay an amount up to the lesser of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains). In addition, MLIC will be permitted to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in excess of the amounts allowed under both standards only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the New York Superintendent of Financial Services (the  Superintendent ) and the Superintendent either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the dividend within 30 days of its filing. Under New York Insurance Law, the Superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders.

   Under Delaware Insurance Code, each of American Life, MetLife USA and Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company ( MTL ) is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a stockholder dividend to MetLife, Inc. as long as the amount of the dividend, when aggregated with all other dividends in the preceding 12 months, does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) its net statutory gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains). Each of American Life, MetLife USA, and MTL will be permitted to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in excess of the greater of such two amounts only if it files notice of the declaration of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Delaware Commissioner of Insurance (the  Delaware Commissioner ) and the Delaware Commissioner either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing. In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned surplus (defined as  unassigned funds (surplus) ) as of the immediately preceding calendar year requires insurance regulatory approval. Under Delaware Insurance Code, the Delaware Commissioner has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders. 
  Under the Rhode Island Insurance Code, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company ( MPC ) is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a stockholder dividend to MetLife, Inc. as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any 12 month period does not exceed the lesser of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) net income, not including realized capital gains, for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including pro rata distributions of MPC s own securities. In determining whether a dividend is extraordinary, MPC may include carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years, excluding realized capital gains less dividends paid in the second and immediately preceding calendar years. MPC will be permitted to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Rhode Island Commissioner of Insurance (the  Rhode Island Commissioner ) and the Rhode Island Commissioner either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing. Under the Rhode Island Insurance Code, the Rhode Island Commissioner has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock property and casualty insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders. 
  MetLife, Inc. 
  In addition to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by its insurance subsidiaries to MetLife, Inc., the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc. to its stockholders is also subject to restrictions. The declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors, and will depend on its financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. In addition, the payment of dividends on MetLife, Inc. s common stock, and MetLife, Inc. s ability to repurchase its common stock, may be subject to restrictions described below arising out of (i) regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Federal Reserve Board ) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (collectively, with the Federal Reserve Board, the  Federal Reserve ) as a result of the designation of MetLife, Inc. by the Financial Stability Oversight Council ( FSOC ) as a non-bank systemically important financial institution ( non-bank SIFI ), and (ii) restrictions under the terms of MetLife, Inc. s preferred stock, and junior subordinated debentures in situations where MetLife, Inc. may be experiencing financial stress, as described below. For purposes of this discussion,  junior subordinated debentures  are deemed to include MetLife, Inc. s Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities, which are exchangeable at the option of MetLife, Inc., or in the future upon the occurrence of certain events, for junior subordinated debentures, and which contain terms with the same substantive effects described in this discussion as the terms in MetLife s junior subordinated debentures. 
  Regulatory Restriction  s. On December 18, 2014, the FSOC designated MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. On January 13, 2015, MetLife, Inc. filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia asking the court to review and rescind the FSOC s designation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI. The court held oral argument on the parties  cross motions for summary judgment on February 10, 2016. On January 12, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced its plan to pursue the Separation. See Note 23. The proposed Separation has no impact on MetLife, Inc. s current status as a non-bank SIFI.

  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  16. Equity (continued) 

   The Federal Reserve Board is required under Dodd-Frank to adopt enhanced prudential standards, including heightened capital and stress testing requirements, for non-bank SIFIs. Under such stress testing requirements, MetLife, Inc. s ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock will be dependent on demonstrating the robustness of its capital planning and projection processes, as well as its ability to maintain the Company s capital levels above regulatory minimum levels under stress scenarios. While these stress testing requirements have been adopted, they will not be effective until rules relating to capital requirements are implemented. Although the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it intends to apply enhanced prudential standards to non-bank SIFIs by rule or order, it has not yet done so. Therefore, the manner in which these proposed standards might apply to MetLife, Inc. remains unclear. Enhanced prudential and capital standards imposed on MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI could adversely affect its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders, as well as repurchase its common stock or other securities or engage in other transactions that could affect its capital. In addition, MetLife, Inc. may not be able to pay dividends if it does not receive sufficient funds from its operating subsidiaries, which are themselves subject to separate regulatory restrictions on their ability to pay dividends. See    Dividend Restrictions.  
  MetLife, Inc. has also been designated as a global systemically important insurer by the Financial Stability Board. As such, it could be subject to enhanced capital standards and supervision and other additional requirements that would not apply to companies that are not so designated. These policy proposals would need to be implemented by legislation or regulation in each applicable jurisdiction, and the impact on MetLife, Inc. is uncertain. 
   Dividend Stopper      Provisions in the Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures  . Certain terms of MetLife, Inc. s preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures (sometimes referred to as  dividend stoppers ) may prevent it from repurchasing its common or preferred stock or paying dividends on its common or preferred stock in certain circumstances. Dividends on the preferred stock are not cumulative. If a dividend is not declared before the dividend payment date, MetLife, Inc. has no obligation to pay dividends accrued for that dividend period whether or not dividends are declared and paid in future periods. No dividends may, however, be paid or declared on MetLife, Inc. s common stock   or any other securities ranking junior to the preferred stock   unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on all preferred stock, and any parity stock, have been declared and paid or provided for. Under the junior subordinated debentures, if MetLife, Inc. has not paid in full the accrued interest on its junior subordinated debentures through the most recent interest payment date, it may not repurchase or pay dividends on its common stock or other capital stock (including the preferred stock), subject to certain exceptions. The junior subordinated debentures provide that MetLife may, at its option and provided that certain conditions are met, defer payment of interest without giving rise to an event of default for periods of up to 10 years (although after five years MetLife, Inc. would be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell equity securities to raise proceeds to pay the interest), with no limitation on the number of deferral periods that MetLife, Inc. may begin, so long as all accrued and unpaid interest is paid with respect to prior deferral periods. If MetLife, Inc. were to elect to defer payments of interest, the  dividend stopper  provisions in the junior subordinated debentures would thus prevent MetLife, Inc. from repurchasing or paying dividends on its common stock or other capital stock (including the preferred stock) during the period of deferral, subject to exceptions. 
  In addition, the preferred stock and the junior subordinated debentures contain provisions that would automatically suspend the payment of preferred stock dividends and junior subordinated debenture interest payments if MetLife, Inc. fails to meet certain risk based capital ratio, net income and stockholders  equity tests at specified times. In such cases, however, MetLife would be permitted to make the payments if it were able to utilize a prescribed alternative payment mechanism. As a result of the suspension of these payments, the  dividend stopper  provisions would come into effect. 
  MetLife, Inc. is a party to certain RCCs which limit its ability to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of preferred stock or junior subordinated debentures by requiring MetLife, Inc., subject to certain limitations, to receive cash proceeds during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement securities prior to any such repayment, redemption or purchase. See    Preferred Stock  for a description of such covenants in effect with respect to the preferred stock, and   Note 14   for a description of such covenants in effect with respect to junior subordinated debentures.

    18. Employee Benefit Plans 
    Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 
  Certain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. sponsor and/or administer various U.S. qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans covering employees and sales representatives who meet specified eligibility requirements. U.S. pension benefits are provided utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance formula. The traditional formula provides benefits that are primarily based upon years of credited service and either final average or career average earnings. The cash balance formula utilizes hypothetical or notional accounts which credit participants with benefits equal to a percentage of eligible pay, as well as earnings credits, determined annually based upon the average annual rate of interest on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities, for each account balance. The U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide supplemental benefits in excess of limits applicable to a qualified plan. The non-U.S. pension plans generally provide benefits based upon either years of credited service and earnings preceding-retirement or points earned on job grades and other factors in years of service. 
  These subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for U.S. retired employees. Employees of these subsidiaries who were hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working for one of the subsidiaries may become eligible for these other postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total costs of postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical benefits.

   Assumptions 
  Assumptions used in determining benefit obligations for the U.S. plans were as follows: 

Assumptions used in determining net periodic benefit costs for the U.S. Plans were as follows: 

The weighted average discount rate for the U.S. plans is determined annually based on the yield, measured on a yield to worst basis, of a hypothetical portfolio constructed of high quality debt instruments available on the valuation date, which would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the aggregate PBO when due. 
  The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the U.S. plans is based on anticipated performance of the various asset sectors in which the plans invest, weighted by target allocation percentages. Anticipated future performance is based on long-term historical returns of the plan assets by sector, adjusted for the long-term expectations on the performance of the markets. While the precise expected rate of return derived using this approach will fluctuate from year to year, the policy is to hold this long-term assumption constant as long as it remains within reasonable tolerance from the derived rate. 
  The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for use in that plan s valuation in   2016   is currently anticipated to be   6.00%   for U.S. pension benefits and   5.52%   for U.S. other postretirement benefits.  
  The assumed healthcare costs trend rates used in measuring the APBO and net periodic benefit costs were as follows:

As of   December 31, 2014  , the improved mortality rate assumption used for all U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans is the RP-2000 healthy mortality table projected generationally using 175% of Scale AA. The mortality rate assumption was revised based upon the results of a comprehensive study of MetLife s demographic experience and reflects the current best estimate of expected mortality rates for MetLife s participant population. Prior to   December 31, 2014  , the mortality rate assumption used to value the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost for these plans was the RP-2000 healthy mortality table projected generationally using 100% of Scale AA.  
  Plan Assets 
  Certain U.S. subsidiaries provide employees with benefits under various Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ) benefit plans. These include qualified pension plans, postretirement medical plans and certain retiree life insurance coverage. The assets of these U.S. subsidiaries  qualified pension plans are held in an insurance group annuity contract, and the vast majority of the assets of the postretirement medical plan and backing the retiree life coverage are held in a trust which largely utilizes insurance contracts to hold the assets. All of these contracts are issued by the Company s insurance affiliates, and the assets under the contracts are held in insurance separate accounts that have been established by the Company. The underlying assets of the separate accounts are principally comprised of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed maturity and equity securities, derivatives, real estate, private equity investments and hedge fund investments. 
  The insurance contract provider engages investment management firms ( Managers ) to serve as sub-advisors for the separate accounts based on the specific investment needs and requests identified by the plan fiduciary. These Managers have portfolio management discretion over the purchasing and selling of securities and other investment assets pursuant to the respective investment management agreements and guidelines established for each insurance separate account. The assets of the qualified pension plans and postretirement medical plans (the  Invested Plans ) are well diversified across multiple asset categories and across a number of different Managers, with the intent of minimizing risk concentrations within any given asset category or with any of the given Managers. 
  The Invested Plans, other than those held in participant directed investment accounts, are managed in accordance with investment policies consistent with the longer-term nature of related benefit obligations and within prudent risk parameters. Specifically, investment policies are oriented toward (i) maximizing the Invested Plan s funded status; (ii) minimizing the volatility of the Invested Plan s funded status; (iii) generating asset returns that exceed liability increases; and (iv) targeting rates of return in excess of a custom benchmark and industry standards over appropriate reference time periods. These goals are expected to be met through identifying appropriate and diversified asset classes and allocations, ensuring adequate liquidity to pay benefits and expenses when due and controlling the costs of administering and managing the Invested Plan s investments. Independent investment consultants are periodically used to evaluate the investment risk of Invested Plan s assets relative to liabilities, analyze the economic and portfolio impact of various asset allocations and management strategies and to recommend asset allocations. 
  Derivative contracts may be used to reduce investment risk, to manage duration and to replicate the risk/return profile of an asset or asset class. Derivatives may not be used to leverage a portfolio in any manner, such as to magnify exposure to an asset, asset class, interest rates or any other financial variable. Derivatives are also prohibited for use in creating exposures to securities, currencies, indices or any other financial variable that is otherwise restricted.

   The table below summarizes the actual weighted average allocation of the estimated fair value of total plan assets by asset class at December 31 for the years indicated and the approved target allocation by major asset class at   December 31, 2015   for the Invested Plans: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Alternative securities primarily include derivative assets, money market securities, short-term investments and other investments. U.S. other postretirement benefits do not include postretirement life s target and actual allocation of plan assets that are all in short-term investments. 
     Estimated Fair Value 
  The pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy, as described in   Note 10  , based upon the significant input with the lowest level in its valuation. The Level 2 asset category includes certain separate accounts that are primarily invested in liquid and readily marketable securities. The estimated fair value of such separate accounts is based upon reported NAV provided by fund managers and this value represents the amount at which transfers into and out of the respective separate account are effected. These separate accounts provide reasonable levels of price transparency and can be corroborated through observable market data. Directly held investments are primarily invested in U.S. and foreign government and corporate securities. The Level 3 asset category includes separate accounts that are invested in assets that provide little or no price transparency due to the infrequency with which the underlying assets trade and generally require additional time to liquidate in an orderly manner. Accordingly, the values for separate accounts invested in these alternative asset classes are based on inputs that cannot be readily derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

  Expected Future Contributions and Benefit Payments 
  It is the subsidiaries  practice to make contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan to comply with minimum funding requirements of ERISA. In accordance with such practice, no contributions are required for   2016  . The subsidiaries expect to make discretionary contributions to the qualified pension plan of   $300 million   in   2016  . For information on employer contributions, see    Obligations and Funded Status.  
  Benefit payments due under the U.S. nonqualified pension plans are primarily funded from the subsidiaries  general assets as they become due under the provision of the plans, therefore benefit payments equal employer contributions. The U.S. subsidiaries expect to make contributions of   $65 million   to fund the benefit payments in   2016  . 
  Postretirement benefits are either: (i) not vested under law; (ii) a non-funded obligation of the subsidiaries; or (iii) both. Current regulations do not require funding for these benefits. The subsidiaries use their general assets, net of participant s contributions, to pay postretirement medical claims as they come due. As permitted under the terms of the governing trust document, the subsidiaries may be reimbursed from plan assets for postretirement medical claims paid from their general assets. The U.S. subsidiaries expect to make contributions of   $50 million   towards benefit obligations in   2016   to pay postretirement medical claims.

Additional Information 
  As previously discussed, most of the assets of the U.S. pension benefit plans are held in a group annuity contract issued by the subsidiaries while some of the assets of the U.S. postretirement benefit plans are held in a trust which largely utilizes life insurance contracts issued by the subsidiaries to hold such assets. Total revenues from these contracts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations were   $55 million  ,   $50 million   and   $49 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, and included policy charges and net investment income from investments backing the contracts and administrative fees. Total investment income (loss), including realized and unrealized gains (losses), credited to the account balances was   ($130) million  ,   $1.2 billion   and   $20 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. The terms of these contracts are consistent in all material respects with those the subsidiaries offer to unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated. 
  Defined Contribution Plans 
  Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans under which a portion of employee contributions are matched. These subsidiaries contributed   $80 million  ,   $77 million   and   $93 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.

The Company also has recorded a valuation allowance charge of   $5 million   related to certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, a   $21 million   reduction was related to foreign currency movement and a   $5 million   reduction was recorded as a balance sheet reclassification with other deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance reflects management s assessment, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset for certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. The tax benefit will be recognized when management believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets are realizable.

Under the indemnification provisions of the stock purchase agreement dated March 7, 2010, as amended, by and among MetLife, Inc., American International Group, Inc. ( AIG ) and AM Holdings, MetLife, Inc. has remitted the refund to AIG, net of certain amounts it can retain as a counter claim. The receipt of the refund, net of obligations to AIG with related foreign currency exchange impact and corresponding U.S. tax effects, resulted in a net charge of   $16 million   in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was comprised of a   $154 million   charge included in other expenses, a   $19 million   gain included in other net investment gains (losses) and a   $119 million   benefit included in provision for income tax expense (benefit). 
  The Company has not provided U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of certain non-U.S. affiliates that have been reinvested indefinitely. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. The Company does not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund U.S. operations. Deferred taxes are provided for earnings of non-U.S. affiliates when the Company plans to remit those earnings. At December 31, 2015, the Company had not made a provision for U.S. taxes on approximately   $4.9 billion   of the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax bases of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries.

   The Company considers the earnings of Japan and the Middle East (excluding the UAE and Turkey) to be available for repatriation. Earnings from the remaining foreign countries are considered to be permanently reinvested. In 2014 and 2013, the Company changed its repatriation assumptions related to the UAE and certain of its European operations, respectively, and now considers these foreign earnings to be permanently reinvested.  
  The Company files income tax returns with the U.S. federal government and various state and local jurisdictions, as well as foreign jurisdictions. The Company is under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. The income tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction and subsidiary. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local income tax examinations for years prior to 2007, except for i) 2000 through 2002 where the IRS disallowance relates to certain tax credits claimed - in April 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (the  Notice ) and paid the tax thereon in September 2015 (see additional details below); and ii) 2003 through 2006, where the IRS disallowance related predominantly to certain tax credits claimed and the Company is engaged with IRS Appeals. Management believes it has established adequate tax liabilities and final resolution for the years 2000 through 2006 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In material foreign jurisdictions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examination for years prior to 2009. 
  The Company recorded a non-cash charge to net income of   $792 million  , net of tax, during the third quarter of 2015. The charge was related to an uncertain tax position and was comprised of a   $557 million   charge included in provision for income tax expense (benefit) and a   $362 million   (  $235 million  , net of tax) charge included in other expenses. This charge is the result of the Company s consideration of recent decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upholding the disallowance of foreign tax credits claimed by other corporate entities not affiliated with the Company. The Company s action relates to tax years from 2000 to 2009, during which MLIC held non-U.S. investments in support of its life insurance business through a United Kingdom investment subsidiary that was structured as a joint venture at the time. 
  There has been no change in the Company s position on the disallowance of its foreign tax credits by the IRS. The Company continues to contest the disallowance of these foreign tax credits by the IRS as management believes the facts strongly support the Company s position. The Company will defend its position vigorously and does not expect any additional charges related to this matter. 
  Also related to the aforementioned foreign tax credit matter, on April 9, 2015, the IRS issued the Notice to the Company. The Notice asserted that the Company owes additional taxes and interest for 2000 through 2002 primarily due to the disallowance of foreign tax credits. The transactions that are the subject of the Notice continue through 2009, and it is likely that the IRS will seek to challenge these later periods. On September 18, 2015, the Company paid the assessed tax and interest of   $444 million   for 2000 through 2002 and will subsequently file a claim for a refund. On November 19, 2015,   $9 million   of this amount was refunded from the IRS as an overpayment of interest. 
  The Company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the next 12 months. A reasonable estimate of the increase or decrease cannot be made at this time. However, the Company continues to believe that the ultimate resolution of the pending issues will not result in a material change to its consolidated financial statements, although the resolution of income tax matters could impact the Company s effective tax rate for a particular future period.

  Interest was as follows: 

______________ 
  (1) The significant increase in 2015 is related to the non-cash charge discussed above. 
  The Company had insignificant penalties for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . 
  The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have indicated that they intend to address through regulations the methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction ( DRD ), related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference between the actual tax expense and expected amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of     35%  . Any regulations that the IRS ultimately proposes for issuance in this area will be subject to public notice and comment, at which time insurance companies and other interested parties will have the opportunity to raise legal and practical questions about the content, scope and application of such regulations. As a result, the ultimate timing and substance of any such regulations are unknown at this time. For the years ended December 31,     2015  ,     2014  , and     2013  , the Company recognized an income tax benefit of     $220 million  ,     $234 million     and     $164 million  , respectively, related to the separate account DRD. The     2015     benefit included a benefit of     $12 million     related to a true-up of the     2014     tax return. The     2014     and     2013     benefit included a benefit of     $38 million     and     $6 million     related to a true-up of the     2013     and     2012     tax returns, respectively  .

    Contingencies 
  Litigation 
  The Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation matters. In some of the matters, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Modern pleading practice in the U.S. permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with the actual experience of the Company in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of time, demonstrates to management that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value. 
  Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain. Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal. Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law. 
  The Company establishes liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been established for a number of the matters noted below. It is possible that some of the matters could require the Company to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated at December 31,   2015  . While the potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information currently known to management, management does not believe any such charges are likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial position. 
  Matters as to Which an Estimate Can Be Made 
  For some of the matters disclosed below, the Company is able to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss. For such matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, no accrual has been made. As of December 31,   2015  , the Company estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued for these matters to be   $0   to   $460 million  . 
  Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made 
  For other matters disclosed below, the Company is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts, and the progress of settlement negotiations. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and updates its accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews.

   Asbestos-Related Claims 
  MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and seek both actual and punitive damages. MLIC has never engaged in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has MLIC issued liability or workers  compensation insurance to companies in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations with respect to certain research, publication and other activities of one or more of MLIC s employees during the period from the 1920 s through approximately the 1950 s and allege that MLIC learned or should have learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health risks. MLIC believes that it should not have legal liability in these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters, however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables, including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions, the nature of the alleged injury and factors unrelated to the ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against MLIC. MLIC employs a number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos loss exposure, including seeking resolution of pending litigation by judicial rulings and settling individual or groups of claims or lawsuits under appropriate circumstances. 
  Claims asserted against MLIC have included negligence, intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks associated with asbestos. MLIC s defenses (beyond denial of certain factual allegations) include that: (i) MLIC owed no duty to the plaintiffs   it had no special relationship with the plaintiffs and did not manufacture, produce, distribute or sell the asbestos products that allegedly injured plaintiffs; (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any actions of MLIC; (iii) MLIC s conduct was not the cause of the plaintiffs  injuries; (iv) plaintiffs  exposure occurred after the dangers of asbestos were known; and (v) the applicable time with respect to filing suit has expired. During the course of the litigation, certain trial courts have granted motions dismissing claims against MLIC, while other trial courts have denied MLIC s motions. There can be no assurance that MLIC will receive favorable decisions on motions in the future. While most cases brought to date have settled, MLIC intends to continue to defend aggressively against claims based on asbestos exposure, including defending claims at trials. 
  The approximate total number of asbestos personal injury claims pending against MLIC as of the dates indicated, the approximate number of new claims during the years ended on those dates and the approximate total settlement payments made to resolve asbestos personal injury claims at or during those years are set forth in the following table: 

______________ 
           (1) 
    Settlement payments represent payments made by MLIC during the year in connection with settlements made in that year and in prior years. Amounts do not include MLIC s attorneys  fees and expenses. 
     The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain and may vary significantly from year to year. 
  The ability of MLIC to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change. The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult to predict the numerous variables that can affect liability estimates, including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against MLIC when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts.

  21. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued) 

   The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years further in the future. In the Company s judgment, there is a future point after which losses cease to be probable and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the Company s total exposure to asbestos claims may be materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued and that future charges to income may be necessary. While the potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information currently known by management, management does not believe any such charges are likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial position. 
  The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims. MLIC s recorded asbestos liability is based on its estimation of the following elements, as informed by the facts presently known to it, its understanding of current law and its past experiences: (i) the probable and reasonably estimable liability for asbestos claims already asserted against MLIC, including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the probable and reasonably estimable liability for asbestos claims not yet asserted against MLIC, but which MLIC believes are reasonably probable of assertion; and (iii) the legal defense costs associated with the foregoing claims. Significant assumptions underlying MLIC s analysis of the adequacy of its recorded liability with respect to asbestos litigation include: (i) the number of future claims; (ii) the cost to resolve claims; and (iii) the cost to defend claims. 
  MLIC reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative and judicial developments, the number of pending claims involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed against it and other defendants and the jurisdictions in which claims are pending. As previously disclosed, in 2014, MLIC increased its recorded liability for asbestos-related claims to   $690 million  . Based upon its regular reevaluation of its exposure from asbestos litigation, MLIC has updated its liability analysis for asbestos-related claims through December 31, 2015. 
  Regulatory Matters 
  The Company receives and responds to subpoenas or other inquiries seeking a broad range of information from state regulators, including state insurance commissioners; state attorneys general or other state governmental authorities; federal regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC  federal governmental authorities, including congressional committees; and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ), as well as from local and national regulators and government authorities in countries outside the United States where MetLife conducts business. The issues involved in information requests and regulatory matters vary widely. The Company cooperates in these inquiries. 
  Mortgage Regulatory and Law Enforcement Authorities  Inquiries 
  MetLife, through its affiliate, MetLife Bank, was engaged in the origination, sale and servicing of forward and reverse residential mortgage loans since 2008. In 2012, MetLife Bank exited the business of originating residential mortgage loans. In 2012 and 2013, MetLife Bank sold its residential mortgage servicing portfolios, and in 2013 wound down its mortgage servicing business. In August 2013, MetLife Bank merged with and into MetLife Home Loans LLC ( MLHL ), its former subsidiary, with MLHL as the surviving non-bank entity. 
  In May 2013, MetLife Bank received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requiring production of documents relating to MetLife Bank s payment of certain foreclosure-related expenses to law firms and business entities affiliated with law firms and relating to MetLife Bank s supervision of such payments, including expenses submitted to the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for reimbursement. It is possible that various state or federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities may seek monetary penalties from MLHL relating to foreclosure practices. 
  The inquiry referred to above could adversely affect MetLife s reputation or result in significant fines, penalties, equitable remedies or other enforcement actions, and result in significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations or other litigation. Exiting the MetLife Bank businesses may not protect MetLife from inquiries and investigations relating to residential mortgage servicing and foreclosure activities, or any fines, penalties, equitable remedies or enforcement actions that may result, the costs of responding to any such governmental investigations, or other litigation. Management believes that the Company s consolidated financial statements as a whole will not be materially affected by these regulatory matters.

   In the Matter of Chemform, Inc. Site, Pompano Beach, Broward County, Florida 
  In July 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) advised MLIC that it believed payments were due under   two   settlement agreements, known as  Administrative Orders on Consent,  that New England Mutual Life Insurance Company ( New England Mutual ) signed in 1989 and 1992 with respect to the cleanup of a Superfund site in Florida (the  Chemform Site ). The EPA originally contacted MLIC (as successor to New England Mutual) and a third party in 2001, and advised that they owed additional clean-up costs for the Chemform Site. The matter was not resolved at that time. The EPA is requesting payment of an amount under   $1 million   from MLIC and such third party for past costs and an additional amount for future environmental testing costs at the Chemform Site. In September 2012, the EPA, MLIC and the third party executed an Administrative Order on Consent under which MLIC and the third party have agreed to be responsible for certain environmental testing at the Chemform Site. The Company estimates that its costs for the environmental testing will not exceed   $100,000  . The September 2012 Administrative Order on Consent does not resolve the EPA s claim for past clean-up costs. The EPA may seek additional costs if the environmental testing identifies issues. The Company estimates that the aggregate cost to resolve this matter will not exceed   $1 million  . 
  New York Licensing Inquiry 
  The Company entered into a consent order with the Department of Financial Services to resolve its inquiry into whether American Life and DelAm conducted business in New York without a license and whether representatives acting on behalf of those companies solicited, sold or negotiated insurance products in New York without a license. The Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the District Attorney, New York County, regarding the same conduct. Pursuant to these agreements, in the first quarter of 2014, the Company paid   $50 million   to the Department of Financial Services and   $10 million   to the District Attorney, New York County. The Department of Financial Services consent order allowed certain activities in New York related to American Life and other entities to continue through June 30, 2015. On July 2, 2015, New York Insurance Law Section 2117 was amended to allow certain activities to take place in New York that relate to a policy or contract of group life, group annuity, or group accident and health insurance where the policyholder or proposed policyholder is a multinational entity resident outside the United States. The Company is continuing to cooperate with the New York State Office of the Attorney General Taxpayer Protection Bureau as to its inquiry concerning American Life s and DelAm s New York State tax filings. 
  Sales Practices Regulatory Matters 
  Regulatory authorities in a number of states and FINRA, and occasionally the SEC, have had investigations or inquiries relating to sales of individual life insurance policies or annuities or other products by MLIC, MetLife USA, New England Life Insurance Company ( NELICO ) and General American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC ), and broker-dealer, MetLife Securities, Inc. ( MSI ). These investigations often focus on the conduct of particular financial services representatives and the sale of unregistered or unsuitable products or the misuse of client assets. Over the past several years, these and a number of investigations by other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments and certain other relief, including restitution payments. The Company may continue to resolve investigations in a similar manner. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for these sales practices-related investigations or inquiries. 
  FINRA Investigation of Sale and Replacement of Variable Annuities 
  On September 25, 2015, FINRA served notice that it will recommend disciplinary action against MetLife, Inc. s affiliated broker-dealer, MSI, in connection with potential violations of FINRA rules regarding alleged misrepresentations, suitability, and supervision in connection with sales and replacements of variable annuities and certain riders on such annuities. FINRA staff has indicated they will seek a significant fine. The Company is cooperating in this investigation. The Company has included what it believes to be the probable and estimable amount of such loss in the Company s consolidated financial statements, and has included amounts for potential additional liability in excess of that accrued in the aggregate estimate of reasonably possible loss provided above.

   Unclaimed Property Litigation 
  West Virginia Lawsuits 
  On September 20, 2012, the West Virginia Treasurer filed an action against MLIC in West Virginia state court (West Virginia ex rel. John D. Perdue v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, Circuit Court of Putnam County, Civil Action No. 12-C-295) alleging that MLIC violated the West Virginia Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, seeking to compel compliance with the Act, and seeking payment of unclaimed property, interest, and penalties. On November 14, 2012, November 21, 2012, December 28, 2012, and January 9, 2013, the Treasurer filed substantially identical suits against MetLife Investors USA, NELICO, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut and GALIC, respectively. On June 16, 2015, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court s order that had granted defendants  motions to dismiss the actions and remanded them to the Circuit Court for further proceedings. The defendants intend to defend these actions vigorously. 
  City of Westland Police and Fire Retirement System v. MetLife, Inc., et. al. (S.D.N.Y., filed January 12, 2012) 
  Seeking to represent a class of persons who purchased MetLife, Inc. common shares between February 2, 2010, and October 6, 2011, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint alleging that MetLife, Inc. and several current and former directors and executive officers of MetLife, Inc. violated the Securities Act of 1933 ( Securities Act ), as well as the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by issuing, or causing MetLife, Inc. to issue, materially false and misleading statements concerning MetLife, Inc. s potential liability for millions of dollars in insurance benefits that should have been paid to beneficiaries or escheated to the states. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On September 11, 2015, the court issued an order dismissing all claims under the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and dismissing all claims under the Securities Act except for those based on alleged misrepresentations of mortality ratios. Following the court s September 11, 2015 order, the plaintiff filed a third amended complaint that supplemented the factual allegations of the second amended complaint. The defendants intend to continue to defend this action vigorously. 
  City of Birmingham Retirement and Relief System v. MetLife, Inc., et al. (Circuit Court of Jefferson County Alabama, filed July 5, 2012) 
  Seeking to represent a class of persons who purchased MetLife, Inc. common equity units in or traceable to a public offering in March 2011, the plaintiff filed an action alleging that MetLife, Inc., certain current and former directors and executive officers of MetLife, Inc., and various underwriters violated several provisions of the Securities Act related to the filing of the registration statement by issuing, or causing MetLife, Inc. to issue, materially false and misleading statements and/or omissions concerning MetLife, Inc. s potential liability for millions of dollars in insurance benefits that should have been paid to beneficiaries or escheated to the states. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On March 31, 2015, a federal court granted plaintiff s motion to remand this action to state court. On October 14, 2015, the state court denied the defendants  motion to dismiss the complaint. The defendants intend to defend this action vigorously. 
  Derivative Actions 
  Seeking to sue derivatively on behalf of MetLife, Inc.,   two   shareholders commenced separate actions against members of the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, alleging that they breached their fiduciary and other duties to the Company. Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to ensure that the Company complied with state unclaimed property laws and to ensure that the Company accurately reported its earnings. Plaintiffs alleged that because of the defendants  breaches of duty, MetLife, Inc. had incurred damage to its reputation and had suffered other unspecified damages. The two actions (Mallon v. Kandarian, et al. (S.D.N.Y., filed March 28, 2012) and Martino v. Kandarian, et al. (S.D.N.Y., filed April 19, 2012)) were consolidated. On December 25, 2015, the court granted the defendants  motion to dismiss the consolidated action, holding that the action is moot. 
  Total Control Accounts Litigation 
  MLIC is a defendant in a lawsuit related to its use of retained asset accounts, known as TCA, as a settlement option for death benefits.

   Owens v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (N.D. Ga., filed April 17, 2014) 
  Plaintiff filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of all persons for whom MLIC established a TCA to pay death benefits under an ERISA plan. The action alleges that MLIC s use of the TCA as the settlement option for life insurance benefits under some group life insurance policies violates MLIC s fiduciary duties under ERISA. As damages, plaintiff seeks disgorgement of profits that MLIC realized on accounts owned by members of the putative class. The court denied MLIC s motion to dismiss the complaint. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously. 
  Reinsurance Litigation 
  Robainas, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (S.D.N.Y., December 16, 2014) 
  Plaintiffs filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all persons and entities who, directly or indirectly, purchased, renewed or paid premiums on life insurance policies issued by MLIC from 2009 through 2014 (the  Policies ). Two similar actions were subsequently filed,     Yale v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (S.D.N.Y., January 12, 2015) and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 15 v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (E.D.N.Y., February 2, 2015)  . Both of these actions were consolidated with the Robainas action. The consolidated complaint alleges that MLIC inadequately disclosed in its statutory annual statements that certain reinsurance transactions with affiliated reinsurance companies were collateralized using  contractual parental guarantees,  and thereby allegedly misrepresented its financial condition and the adequacy of its reserves. The lawsuit sought recovery under Section 4226 of the New York Insurance Law of a statutory penalty in the amount of the premiums paid for the Policies. On October 9, 2015, the court granted MLIC s motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, finding that plaintiffs lacked Article III standing because they did not allege any concrete injury as a result of the alleged conduct. Plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 
  Intoccia v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (S.D.N.Y., April 20, 2015) 
  Plaintiffs filed this putative class action on behalf of themselves and all persons and entities who, directly or indirectly, purchased, renewed or paid premiums for Guaranteed Benefits Insurance Riders attached to variable annuity contracts with MLIC from 2009 through 2015 (the  Annuities ). The court consolidated     Weilert v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.     (S.D.N.Y., April 30, 2015) with the     Intoccia     case, and the consolidated, amended complaint alleges that MLIC inadequately disclosed in its statutory annual statements that certain reinsurance transactions with affiliated reinsurance companies were collateralized using  contractual parental guarantees,  and thereby allegedly misrepresented its financial condition and the adequacy of its reserves. The lawsuits seek recovery under Section 4226 of the New York Insurance Law of a statutory penalty in the amount of the premiums paid for Guaranteed Benefits Insurance Riders attached to the Annuities. The Court granted MLIC s motion to dismiss, adopting the reasoning of the     Robainas     decision. Plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 
  Other Litigation 
  McGuire v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (E.D. Mich., filed February 22, 2012) 
  This lawsuit was filed by the fiduciary for the Union Carbide Employees  Pension Plan and alleges that MLIC, which issued annuity contracts to fund some of the benefits the Plan provides, engaged in transactions that ERISA prohibits and violated duties under ERISA and federal common law by determining that no dividends were payable with respect to the contracts from and after 1999. On August 8, 2014, the court denied the parties  motions for summary judgment. The court has set a June 6, 2016 trial date.

   Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada Indemnity Claim 
  In 2006, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada ( Sun Life ), as successor to the purchaser of MLIC s Canadian operations, filed a lawsuit in Toronto, seeking a declaration that MLIC remains liable for  market conduct claims  related to certain individual life insurance policies sold by MLIC and that were transferred to Sun Life. Sun Life had asked that the court require MLIC to indemnify Sun Life for these claims pursuant to indemnity provisions in the sale agreement for the sale of MLIC s Canadian operations entered into in June of 1998. In January 2010, the court found that Sun Life had given timely notice of its claim for indemnification but, because it found that Sun Life had not yet incurred an indemnifiable loss, granted MLIC s motion for summary judgment. Both parties appealed but subsequently agreed to withdraw the appeal and consider the indemnity claim through arbitration. In September 2010, Sun Life notified MLIC that a purported class action lawsuit was filed against Sun Life in Toronto, Fehr v. Sun Life Assurance Co. (Super. Ct., Ontario, September 2010), alleging sales practices claims regarding the same individual policies sold by MLIC and transferred to Sun Life. An amended class action complaint in that case was served on Sun Life in May 2013, again without naming MLIC as a party. On August 30, 2011, Sun Life notified MLIC that a purported class action lawsuit was filed against Sun Life in Vancouver, Alamwala v. Sun Life Assurance Co. (Sup. Ct., British Columbia, August 2011), alleging sales practices claims regarding certain of the same policies sold by MLIC and transferred to Sun Life. Sun Life contends that MLIC is obligated to indemnify Sun Life for some or all of the claims in these lawsuits. These sales practices cases against Sun Life are ongoing and the Company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss arising from this litigation. 
  Fauley v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., et al. (Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial Circuit, Lake County, Ill., July 3, 2014). 
  Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against defendants, including MLIC and a former MetLife financial services representative, alleging that the defendants sent unsolicited fax advertisements to plaintiff and others in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act, 47 U.S.C.   227. The court issued a final order certifying a nationwide settlement class and approving a settlement under which MLIC has agreed to pay up to   $23 million   to resolve claims as to fax ads sent between August 23, 2008 and August 7, 2014. Objectors to the settlement have appealed the approval order. 
  MetLife, Inc. v. Financial Stability Oversight Council (D. D.C., January 13, 2015). 
  MetLife, Inc. filed this action in federal court seeking to overturn the FSOC s designation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI. The suit is brought under the section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act providing that a company designated as a non-bank SIFI may petition the federal courts for review, and seeks an order requiring that the final determination be rescinded. The court held oral argument on the parties  cross motions for summary judgment on February 10, 2016. 
  Voshall v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, April 8, 2015) 
  Plaintiff filed this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of himself and all persons covered under a long-term group disability income insurance policy issued by MLIC to public entities in California between April 8, 2011 and April 8, 2015. Plaintiff alleges that MLIC improperly reduced benefits by including cost of living adjustments and employee paid contributions in the employer retirement benefits and other income that reduces the benefit payable under such policies. Plaintiff asserts causes of action for declaratory relief, violation of the California Business   Professions Code, breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously. 
  Martin v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, (Superior Court of the State of California, County of Contra Costa, filed December 17, 2015) 
  Plaintiffs filed this this putative class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all California persons who have been charged compound interest by MLIC in life insurance policy and/or premium loan balances within the last four years. Plaintiffs allege that MLIC has engaged in a pattern and practice of charging compound interest on life insurance policy and premium loans without the borrower authorizing such compounding, and that this constitutes an unlawful business practice under California law. Plaintiff asserts causes of action for declaratory relief, violation of California s Unfair Competition Law and Usury Law, and unjust enrichment. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, restitution of interest, and damages in an unspecified amount. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously.

   Lau v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (S.D.N.Y. filed, December 3, 2015) 
  This putative class action lawsuit was filed by a single defined contribution plan participant on behalf of all ERISA plans whose assets were invested in MetLife s  Group Annuity Contract Stable Value Funds  within the past six years. The suit alleges breaches of fiduciary duty under ERISA and challenges the  spread  with respect to the stable value fund group annuity products sold to retirement plans. The allegations focus on the methodology MetLife uses to establish and reset the crediting rate, the terms under which plan participants are permitted to transfer funds from a stable value option to another investment option, the procedures followed if an employer terminates a contract, and the level of disclosure provided. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages in an unspecified amount. The Company intends to defend this action vigorously. 
  Sales Practices Claims 
  Over the past several years, the Company has faced numerous claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging improper marketing or sales of individual life insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds, other products or the misuse of client assets. Some of the current cases seek substantial damages, including punitive and treble damages and attorneys  fees. The Company continues to defend vigorously against the claims in these matters. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for sales practices matters. 
  Summary 
  Putative or certified class action litigation and other litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in addition to those discussed previously and those otherwise provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of the Company s business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its activities as an insurer, mortgage lending bank, employer, investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the Company s compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. 
  It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to previously, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material effect upon the Company s financial position, based on information currently known by the Company s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. 
    Commitments 
  Leases 
  The Company, as lessee, has entered into various lease and sublease agreements for office space, information technology, aircrafts, automobiles, and other equipment. Future minimum gross rental payments relating to these lease arrangements are as follows: 

340 

     Table of Contents  
  MetLife, Inc. 
  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued) 
  21. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued) 

   Total minimum rentals to be received in the future under non-cancelable subleases were   $97 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . Operating lease expense was   $364 million  ,   $347 million   and   $372 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
    Insolvency Assessments 
  Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to transact business require insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. In addition, Japan has established the Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation of Japan as a contingency to protect policyholders against the insolvency of life insurance companies in Japan through assessments to companies licensed to provide life insurance. 
  Assets and liabilities held for insolvency assessments were as follows: 

Mortgage Loan Commitments 
  The Company commits to lend funds under mortgage loan commitments. The amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were   $4.4 billion   and   $4.0 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  Commitments to Fund Partnership Investments, Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private Corporate Bond Investments 
  The Company commits to fund partnership investments and to lend funds under bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts of these unfunded commitments were   $7.1 billion   and   $5.3 billion   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    Guarantees 
  In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties such that it may be required to make payments now or in the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition, investment and other transactions, the Company has provided indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax, environmental and other specific liabilities and other indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Company provides indemnifications to counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as third-party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than   $1 million   to   $800 million  , with a cumulative maximum of   $1.5 billion  , while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to make any material payments under these indemnities, guarantees, or commitments.

  21. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued) 

   In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the Company s interests. Since these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these indemnities in the future. 
  The Company has also minimum fund yield requirements on certain international pension funds in accordance with local laws. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. 
  The Company s recorded liabilities were   $8 million   and   $4 million   at December 31,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, for indemnities, guarantees and commitments.

    Common Stock Repurchases 
  In 2016, through   January 7, 2016  , MetLife, Inc. repurchased   1,445,864   shares of its common stock in the open market for   $70 million   completing   the September 2015 authorization.

The dividend will be payable   March 15, 2016   to shareholders of record as of   February 29, 2016  . 
  Common Stock 
  On   January 6, 2016  , the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors declared a   first quarter 2016   common stock dividend of   $0.375   per share payable on   March 14, 2016   to shareholders of record as of   February 5, 2016  . The Company estimates that the aggregate dividend payment will be   $413 million  . 
  The Separation 
  On January 12, 2016, the Company announced its plan to pursue the Separation. The Company is currently evaluating structural alternatives for the proposed Separation, including a public offering of shares in an independent, publicly traded company, a spin-off, or a sale. The completion of a public offering would depend on, among other things, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing and review process, as well as market conditions. Any Separation that might occur will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval of any transaction by the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the SEC, and receipt of insurance and other regulatory approvals and other anticipated conditions.

    1. Basis of Presentation 
    The condensed financial information of MetLife, Inc. (the  Parent Company ) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries and the notes thereto (the  Consolidated Financial Statements ). These condensed unconsolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for MetLife, Inc. Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
  The preparation of these condensed unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions. The most important of these estimates and assumptions relate to the fair value measurements, the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and the provision for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits, which may affect the amounts reported in the condensed unconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
    2. Investment in Subsidiaries 
    In December 2015, MetLife, Inc. accrued   $50 million  ,   $45 million   and   $25 million   in capital contributions payable to the following captive reinsurers: MRV, MRD and MRSC, respectively, which were included in payables to subsidiaries at December 31, 2015. The payables were settled for cash in February 2016. See Note 6. 
  In December 2014, MetLife, Inc. accrued   $350 million   and   $95 million   in capital contributions payable to MRV and MRD, respectively, which were included in payables to subsidiaries at December 31, 2014. The payables were settled for cash in February 2015. 
  In 2014, in connection with the mergers into MetLife USA of certain of its affiliates and a subsidiary, MetLife, Inc. recorded   $5.7 billion   in non-cash returns of capital from subsidiaries, including   $2.0 billion   of Exeter s preferred stock, and correspondingly recorded   $5.7 billion   of non-cash capital contributions to subsidiaries. In November 2014, upon the consummation of the mergers, the   $2.0 billion   of outstanding preferred stock of Exeter was canceled. Consequently, MetLife, Inc. s preferred capital stock investment was added to its common capital stock investment in MetLife USA. 
    3. Loans to Subsidiaries 
    MetLife, Inc. lends funds, as necessary, to its subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital requirements. Payments of interest and principal on surplus notes of regulated subsidiaries, which are subordinate to all other obligations of the issuing company, may be made only with the prior approval of the insurance department of the state of domicile. 
  In May 2015, American Life issued a   $150 million   short-term note to MetLife, Inc. which was repaid in June 2015. The short-term note bore interest at   six-month LIBOR plus 1.00%  .

  In December 2013, MRD issued a   $350 million   surplus note to MetLife, Inc. due   December 2033  . The surplus note bears interest at a fixed rate of   6.00%  , payable semi-annually. MetLife, Inc. issued a   $350 million   senior note to MRD in exchange for the surplus note (see Note 4).

  Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  There were no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) during the quarter ended December 31,   2015   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  Management of MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are executed in accordance with management s authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. 
  Management has documented and evaluated the effectiveness of the internal control of the Company at December 31,     2015     pertaining to financial reporting in accordance with the criteria established in     Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)     issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
  In the opinion of management, MetLife, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at December 31,   2015  . 
  Deloitte   Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedules included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  .

  Report of the Company s Registered Public Accounting Firm

   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
  MetLife, Inc. 
  New York, New York 
  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of December 31,   2015  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework   (  2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,   2015  , based on the criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31,   2015  , of the Company and our report dated February 24,   2016   expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules.

Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Shares were awarded under the 2005 Stock Plan and 2015 Stock Plan. 
  The maximum performance factor for Performance Shares granted in 2013, 2014, and 2015 was 175%. The number of Performance Shares outstanding as of   December 31, 2015   at target (100%) performance factor was 3,907,174. 
  Deferred Shares are Shares that are covered by awards that have become payable under any plan, but the issuance of which has been deferred. 
  For a general description of how the number of Shares paid out on account of Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units is determined, and the vesting periods applicable to Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units, see Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
           (3)

                     Shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Stock Plan at its effective date, January 1, 2015     
    11,750,000 
      
      Shares remaining authorized for issuance under the 2005 Stock Plan that were not covered by awards, including shares previously covered by awards but once again available due to forfeiture of awards, as of January 1, 2015, the effective date of the 2015 Stock Plan 
    18,023,959 
      
      Shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Director Stock Plan as of January 1, 2015, the effective date of the 2015 Director Stock Plan (equals shares remaining authorized for issuance under the 2005 Director Stock Plan that were not covered by awards, including shares previously covered by awards but once again available due to forfeiture of awards) 
    1,642,208 
      
      Shares utilized under the 2005 Stock Plan or 2015 Stock Plan that were recovered from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 due to (i) termination of the award by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, lapse, or otherwise without the issuance of Shares; (ii) settlement of the award in cash either in lieu of Shares or otherwise; (iii) exchange of the award for awards not involving Shares; (iv) payment of the exercise price of a Stock Option, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to an award, satisfied by tendering Shares to MetLife, Inc. (by either actual delivery or by attestation); (v) satisfaction of tax withholding requirements with respect to an award satisfied by MetLife, Inc. withholding Shares otherwise issuable; and (vi) payout of the 2012-2014 Performance Shares in 2015 at a performance factor of 101% rather than the maximum performance factor of 175% 
    4,475,737 
      
      Less:   Shares covered by awards granted under the 2015 Stock Plan and 2015 Director Stock Plan since each became effective on January 1, 2015, including   Performance Shares assuming future payout at maximum performance factor, and Shares covered by imputed reinvested dividends credited in 2015 on Deferred Shares

    ) 
      Shares remaining available for future issuance under the 2015 Stock Plan and 2015 Director Stock Plan 
    31,478,119 

Each Share that will or may be issued in connection with awards granted under the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock Plan other than Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (such as Shares payable on account of Performance Shares or Restricted Stock Units) reduces the number of Shares remaining for issuance under that plan, or a successor plan, by 1.179. Each Share that will or may be issued in connection with a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under the 2005 Stock and Incentive Plan reduces the number of Shares remaining for issuance under the 2005 Stock and Incentive Plan, or a successor plan, by 1.0. 
  Each Share that will or may be issued under the 2005 Director Stock Plan, 2015 Stock Plan or 2015 Director Stock Plan reduces the number of Shares remaining for issuance under that plan by one. 
  Under both the 2015 Stock Plan and the 2015 Director Stock Plan, in the event of a corporate event or transaction (including, but not limited to, a change in the Shares or the capitalization of MetLife) such as a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, separation, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split up, spin-off, or other distribution of stock or property of MetLife, combination of securities, exchange of securities, dividend in kind, or other like change in capital structure or distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to shareholders of MetLife, or any similar corporate event or transaction, the appropriate committee of the Board of Directors of MetLife, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants  rights under the applicable plan, shall substitute or adjust, as applicable, the number and kind of Shares that may be issued under that plan and shall adjust the number and kind of Shares subject to outstanding awards. Any Shares related to awards under either plan which: (i) terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or otherwise without the issuance of Shares; (ii) are settled in cash either in lieu of Shares or otherwise; or (iii) are exchanged with the appropriate committee s permission for awards not involving Shares, are available again for grant under the applicable plan. If the option price of any Stock Option granted under either plan or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any award granted under either plan is satisfied by tendering Shares to MetLife (by either actual delivery or by attestation), or if a Stock Appreciation Right is exercised, only the number of Shares issued, net of the Shares tendered, if any, will be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under that plan. The maximum number of Shares available for issuance under either plan shall not be reduced to reflect any dividends or dividend equivalents that are reinvested into additional Shares or credited as additional Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units. 
  For a description of the kinds of awards that may be made under the 2005 Stock and Incentive Plan, 2005 Director Stock Plan, 2015 Stock Plan, and 2015 Director Stock Plan, see Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Exhibit 10.13 
    
  MetLife       
  Agreement to Protect Corporate Property 
  All of the protections described in this Agreement apply to MetLife, Inc., its past, present and future affiliates and each of their successors and assigns (collectively, "MetLife" or "the Company"). This Agreement is presented   to   me in anticipation of my becoming employed by MetLife. In the event that I do not actually become employed with MetLife, this Agreement will be of no force and effect. In consideration of my employment with MetLife, the new and updated access that I will be given to MetLife's intellectual property, MetLife's Confidential Information and MetLife's Proprietary Property (as defined below), and the specialized training and resources regarding MetLife's business, customers and practices that MetLife will provide to me, and intending to be legally bound, I agree as follows: 
           1. 
    Duty of Loyalty  :   I understand and agree that during the course of my employment with MetLife, I owe a duty of loyalty to the Company, which prohibits me from engaging in any act or omission that is adverse to the interests of the Company, except as permitted by law or required by legal process. This prohibition includes but is not limited to interfering with MetLife's business or trying to disrupt MetLife's business or operations, including such conduct as engaging in any activity that interferes with the performance of my duties during my employment, interferes with the duties of other MetLife employees, statutory employees or independent contractors, diverts any business, customers or employees away from MetLife, is reasonably deemed by MetLife to be harmful to the business, reputation or goodwill of MetLife, is in violation of this Agreement, is otherwise contrary to the interests of MetLife, and/or is recognized by any applicable statute, regulation or common law as constituting a breach of the duty of loyalty to my employer. 
              2. 
    Confidential Information and Proprietary Property  :   "Confidential Information" means, without limitation, all information and data provided or made available to me by MetLife, or used by me in the course of performing my duties as an employee of MetLife, that is non-public and/or proprietary, including without limitation all information related   to   (a) MetLife's employees, customers, and third-party contractors; and (b) MetLife's operations, business plans, pricing, financial information, methods, processes, code, data, lists (including customer lists), inventions, improvements, know-how, business methods, processes, techniques, apparatus, statistics, programs, research, development, information technology, network designs, passwords, sign-on codes, and usage data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information excludes information that is generally known or disclosed to the industry through no breach of this Agreement by me or other wrongful act or omission by me or any other person. "Proprietary Property" means, without limitation, property (whether tangible or intangible) owned by or licensed to MetLife, including all MetLife Intellectual Property (as defined below), all premises, proprietary equipment, supplies and other material provided or made available to me by MetLife, or used by me in the course of performing my duties as an employee of MetLife. All Confidential Information and Proprietary Property shall be and remain the sole and exclusive information and/or property of MetLife, as applicable. 
              3. 
    Proprietary Rights  :   I agree that any invention, modification, discovery, design, development, improvement, process, program, work of authorship, document, formula, data, technique, knowhow, trade secret or intellectual property right whatsoever or any interest therein (whether or not protectable under patent, copyright, trademark or similar statutes) made, invented or conceived by me (alone or jointly with others) during my employment with MetLife and for six (6) months thereafter that: (a) relate to the business of MetLife or any customer of or supplier to MetLife or any of the products or services being developed, marketed, distributed or sold by MetLife or which may be used in relation therewith; or (b) results from tasks assigned to me by MetLife or work performed by me for MetLife; or (c) results from the use of Confidential Information and/or Proprietary Property, shall be considered the sole and exclusive property of  

MetLife and its assigns ("MetLife Intellectual Property"). The only exception to the preceding shall be in the event that an officer at least at the level of a Senior Vice President in charge of my department agrees to some other arrangement in writing. I agree to inform MetLife promptly and fully of all MetLife Intellectual Property made or conceived by me or jointly with others. I further agree that any copyrightable works falling within the definition of MetLife Intellectual Property shall be considered "Works Made for Hire," as defined by U.S. Copyright laws, and shall be owned by and for the express benefit of MetLife. To the extent that any MetLife Intellectual Property does not automatically, by operation of law, constitute a "Work Made for Hire," I irrevocably transfer and assign to MetLife (or, to the extent not transferable, waive) all right, title and interest in and to that MetLife Intellectual Property for all forms and media, whether or not now existing, throughout the world, including, without limitation, any right to collect for past damages for the infringement or unauthorized use of such MetLife Intellectual Property. I waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all of my "moral rights" (i.e., accreditation rights to visual works such as videos, images, graphics, etc.) with respect to MetLife Intellectual Property assigned or transferred to MetLife. Promptly, upon the request of MetLife and at MetLife's expense, I will, during the course of my employment and thereafter, provide cooperation and assistance to MetLife in the preparation, prosecution, perfection and defense of any MetLife Intellectual Property. 
           4. 
    Protection and Non-Assignment of MetLife Property  :   I will maintain adequate and current records of all Confidential Information and Proprietary Property (including MetLife Intellectual Property) created by me or provided to me. I further agree that during my employment and after the termination of my employment, I will not disclose to any third party Confidential Information or Proprietary Property, except as authorized by MetLife, and I will comply with MetLife's policies regarding record keeping, non-disclosure, safe-keeping and retention of Confidential Information and/or Proprietary Property (including MetLife Intellectual Property). I represent and warrant that I am not a party to any contract relating to the granting or assignment to any party (other than MetLife) of any interest in MetLife Intellectual Property, Confidential Information and/or Proprietary Property except insofar as copies of such contracts, if any, have been supplied to and accepted by MetLife. I further represent and warrant that the Confidential Information and Proprietary Property created by me and MetLife's use of such Confidential Information and Proprietary Property, does not and will not violate, infringe or misappropriate any intellectual property and/or confidential information rights of any third party or the laws or regulations of any governmental or judicial authority. 
     5.   Non-Interference:   For 18 months following the termination of my employment with MetLife for any reason, I will not, directly or indirectly divert business away from MetLife or seek to have any MetLife customer, person or organization reduce, lapse or terminate any financial products or services obtained from or through MetLife, in such circumstances where I serviced, contacted, solicited or sold to such customer, person or organization, or supervised any MetLife employee in connection with such customer, person or organization during the course of my employment with MetLife, or for whom I possess or have possessed any Confidential Information MetLife Proprietary Property regarding MetLife's services to such customer, person or organization. 
           6. 
    Non-Solicitation  :   For 18 months following the termination of my employment with MetLife for any reason, I will not, directly or indirectly induce, divert, recruit, encourage or attempt to influence anyone in the employ of MetLife (hereinafter "Employee"), or who is a party to a Senior Partner Contract (055 Contract), any New England Financial Agent Contract or Retired Agent Contract (hereinafter "Independent Contractor") to reduce, lapse or terminate his or her employment and/or business relationship with MetLife. For example, I will not inform an Employee or Independent Contractor of a job opportunity with me or any other company or entity, or suggest that any person or entity contact an Employee or Independent Contractor to discuss or mention such a job opportunity. I also will not interview an Employee or Independent Contractor for a job, or offer,  
       2 
  2013 ATPCP 

authorize, approve or agree to hire an Employee or Independent Contractor for any job opportunity with me or any other company. 
           7. 
    Non-Disparagement  :   I will not make statements that damage, disparage or otherwise diminish the reputation and business practices of MetLife and its affiliated entities, and its and their current and/or former officers, agents, directors and employees. This includes statements made verbally, in writing or electronically. The only exception is if I am compelled by a court of law or I am otherwise permitted or authorized to do this pursuant to legal or administrative process. 
              8. 
    Agreement is Reasonable and Necessary to Protect MetLife's Legitimate Business Interests  :   I acknowledge and agree that: (1) the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are reasonable and necessary for the protection of MetLife's legitimate business interests in the intensely competitive insurance, securities, advisory services, retail banking and financial services industries, including without limitation MetLife's longstanding relationships with customers, and are reasonable and necessary to protect MetLife's Intellectual Property, Confidential Information and Proprietary Property (including MetLife Intellectual Property), in which MetLife has invested significant time and money; and (2) but for my employment by MetLife, I would not have access to such Confidential Information and/or Proprietary Property. 
              9. 
    Presentation of Agreement to Subsequent Employers  :   For a period of 18 months following the termination of my employment with MetLife for any reason, I will present a copy of this agreement to each of my subsequent employers or affiliations, and I will inform MetLife promptly of the identity of any such employers or affiliations. I hereby authorize MetLife to present a copy of this Agreement to such employers or affiliations. 
              10. 
    Return of Property  :   Upon the termination of my employment with MetLife for any reason or at any other time requested by MetLife, I shall immediately deliver to MetLife or its designee all MetLife Confidential Information and/or MetLife Proprietary Property (including MetLife Intellectual Property), and all copies thereof in whatever format stored, in my possession, custody or control including, but not limited to any computing device provided to or used by me during the course of my employment with MetLife, including, desk top or laptop computers, mobile devices, USBs, disks, drives, memory devices, telephones, personal digital assistants, or other electronic media. I understand that MetLife will return any computing devices purchased by me or a third party on my behalf after wiping the computing devices clean of all MetLife software and information. 
              11. 
    Geographic Scope  :   I acknowledge that the business of MetLife is conducted in all states and in certain foreign countries and that the employees of MetLife and its affiliated entities are working to further the interests of MetLife in those states and foreign countries. I also acknowledge that the Confidential Information or Proprietary Property (including MetLife Intellectual Property) I obtain in the course of my employment involves and affects MetLife's activities in all states and in those foreign countries in which it conducts its business. Therefore, it is not appropriate or feasible for MetLife to establish geographic limitations on the restrictions to which I am now agreeing. Accordingly, I agree to abide by these restrictions in all states and in those foreign countries in which MetLife is conducting business at the time that my employment terminates, or in any state or foreign countries where MetLife is planning to conduct business and I was or am in possession of any MetLife Intellectual Property, Confidential Information and/or Proprietary Property relating to such plans. 
              12. 
    Injunctive Relief and Attorney's Fees  :   I acknowledge that if I violate any provision of this Agreement, MetLife will suffer irreparable harm. Therefore, in addition to any other rights or remedies of MetLife, MetLife will have the right to obtain an injunction without posting a bond enjoining any such violation. If MetLife succeeds in any lawsuit or proceeding against me brought to enforce this Agreement, or to establish damages sustained by MetLife as a result of my  
       3 
  2013 ATPCP 

violation of this Agreement, I will reimburse MetLife's attorney's fees and costs, as these may be fixed by the court in which MetLife sues me or brings a proceeding against me. 
           13. 
    Tolling Provision  :   In the event that I violate any of the post-employment restrictions of this Agreement, the eighteen (18) month time period of the post-employment restrictions set forth in Sections 5, 6, and/or 9 above shall be extended for a period of time equal to the time between the start of the eighteen (18) month period and the date of the last violation. Such extension does not in any way operate to limit the types of remedies available to MetLife to address any violation of this Agreement. 
              14. 
    Entire Agreement, Severability and No Waiver  :   This document is the entire agreement between me and MetLife with respect to the contents contained herein. No previous promises or agreements, oral or written, including any prior Agreements to Protect Corporate Property with MetLife, will remain in effect. I further agree that my signature on any subsequent agreement with MetLife shall not impair the enforcement of these provisions, unless such subsequent agreement is in writing and expressly identifies this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is invalidated in any jurisdiction either by statute or by a court, it is the parties' intention that such provision will be deemed modified to comply with the law or deemed stricken from this Agreement, if that is necessary to comply with the law. If any provision is stricken for this reason, however, the remainder of this Agreement remains in effect. This Agreement cannot be waived by MetLife unless agreed to in writing by an officer of MetLife at least at the level of a Senior Vice President. Failure to strictly enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such provision or release either party from its obligation to perform strictly in accordance with such provision. 
     I have carefully read this Agreement and I understand it. I acknowledge that I have been given a copy of this Agreement.

Exhibit 10.14 
  Agreement to Protect Corporate Property 
  In consideration of my receipt of stock options from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("MetLife"), I agree to the following: 
           1. 
    All equipment, documents, and all information and other property that belongs to MetLife that I receive or develop in the course of my employment by MetLife, remain the property and information of MetLife. The products of all of my efforts in the course of my employment belong exclusively to MetLife and, unless the officer in charge of my department agrees to some other arrangement in writing, I will not retain any rights in any such work product. I agree to return all property and information immediately and without keeping any copies when my employment terminates for any reason. 
              2. 
    For 18 months following the termination of my employment with MetLife for any reason: 
              A. 
    I will not interfere in MetLife's business or try to disrupt MetLife's business. This includes things I might do through my own efforts, or indirectly through the efforts of others, and I will not use any MetLife information or property to assist others. This includes diverting business away from MetLife or seeking to have any MetLife customer reduce or terminate any insurance obtained from or through MetLife. 
              B. 
    I will not solicit any employee of MetLife or its affiliated entities ("Employee") to become employed, associated or contracted by or with me or any entity in which I am an employee, owner or investor ("Other Company"). I will not solicit any Employee to become employed, associated or contracted with an organization providing services to me or any Other Company. For example, I will not inform an Employee of a job opportunity with me or any Other Company, or suggest that any person or entity contact an Employee to discuss or mention such a job opportunity. I also will not interview an Employee for a job, or offer, authorize, approve or agree to hire an Employee for any job opportunity with me or any Other Company. 
              C. 
    I will not make statements that damage, disparage or otherwise diminish the reputation and business practices of MetLife and its affiliated entities, and its and their officers, directors and employees. This includes statements made verbally, in writing or electronically. The only exception is if I am compelled by a court of law or I am otherwise authorized to do this pursuant to legal or administrative process. 
              D. 
    I authorize MetLife to present a copy of this agreement to each of my subsequent employers. 
              3. 
    I acknowledge that the business of MetLife is conducted all states and in certain foreign countries and that the employees of MetLife and its affiliated entities are working to further the interests of MetLife in those states and foreign countries. I also acknowledge that the property and information I obtain in the course of my employment involves and affects MetLife's activities in all states and in those foreign countries in which it conducts its business. Therefore, it is not appropriate or feasible for MetLife to establish geographic limitations on the restrictions to which I am now agreeing. Accordingly, I agree to abide by these restrictions in all states and in those foreign countries in which MetLife is or has plans to conduct business at the time that my employment terminates. 
              4. 
    I acknowledge that, if I violate any provision of this Agreement, MetLife will suffer irreparable harm. Therefore, in addition to any other rights or remedies of MetLife, MetLife will have the right to obtain an injunction enjoining any such violation. If MetLife succeeds in any lawsuit or proceeding against me brought to enforce this Agreement, or to establish damages sustained by MetLife as a result of my  

violation of this Agreement, I will reimburse MetLife's attorney's fees and costs, as these may be fixed by the court in which MetLife sues me or brings a proceeding against me. 
           5. 
    If any provision of this Agreement is invalidated in any jurisdiction either by statute or by a court, that provision will be deemed modified to comply with the law or deemed stricken from this Agreement, if that is necessary to comply with the law.

    Return of Property  :   Upon the termination of my employment with  MetLife for any reason or at any other time requested by  MetLife, I shall immediately deliver to  MetLife or its designee all  MetLife Confidential and Proprietary Information, Intellectual Property, and all copies thereof in whatever format stored, in my possession, custody or control, as well as any other property and information of  MetLife including, but not limited to any computing device provided to or used by me during the course of my employment with  MetLife, including, but not limited to, computer, disks, drives, memory sticks, telephones, personal digital assistants, or other electronic media, including any leased, borrowed or purchased laptop computer, even if I purchased the computing devices. I understand that MetLife will return any computing devices I purchased after wiping the computing devices clean of all MetLife software and information.  
              11. 
    Geographic Scope  :   I acknowledge that the business of MetLife is conducted in all states and in certain foreign countries and that the employees of MetLife and its affiliated entities are working to further the interests of MetLife in those states and foreign countries. I also acknowledge that the  MetLife Intellectual Property and/or Confidential Information I obtain in the course of my employment involves and affects  MetLife's activities in all states and in those foreign countries in which it conducts its business. Therefore, it is not appropriate or feasible for MetLife to establish geographic limitations on the restrictions to which I am now agreeing. Accordingly, I agree to abide by these restrictions in all states and in those foreign countries in which MetLife is conducting business at the time that my employment terminates, or in any state or foreign countries where MetLife is planning to conduct business and I was or am in possession of any Intellectual Property and/or Confidential and Proprietary Information relating to such plans.  
              12. 
    Injunctive Relief and Attorney's Fees  :   I acknowledge that, if I violate any provision of this Agreement, MetLife will suffer irreparable harm. Therefore, in addition to any other rights or remedies of MetLife, MetLife will have the right to obtain an injunction without posting a bond enjoining any such violation. If  MetLife succeeds in any lawsuit or proceeding against me brought to enforce this Agreement, or to establish damages sustained by  MetLife as a result of my violation of this Agreement, I will reimburse  MetLife's attorney's fees and costs, as these may be fixed by the court in which  MetLife sues me or brings a proceeding against me. 
       3 

13. 
    Tolling Provision  :   In the event that I violate any of the post-employment restrictions of this Agreement, the eighteen (18) month time period of the post-employment restrictions set forth in Sections 5, 6, and/or 9 above shall be extended for a period of time equal to the time between the start of the eighteen (18) month period and the date of the last violation. Such extension does not in any way operate to limit the types of remedies available to MetLife to address any violation of this Agreement. 
              14. 
    Entire Agreement, Severability, and No Waiver  :   This document is the entire agreement between me and  MetLife with respect to the contents contained herein. No previous promises or agreements, oral or written, including any prior Agreements to Protect Corporate Property, will remain in effect. I further agree that my signature on any subsequent agreement with MetLife shall not impair the enforcement of these provisions, unless such subsequent agreement is in writing and expressly identifies this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is invalidated in any jurisdiction either by statute or by a court, it is the parties' intention that such provision will be deemed modified to comply with the law or deemed stricken from this Agreement, if that is necessary to comply with the law. If any provision is stricken for this reason, however, the remainder of this Agreement remains in effect. This Agreement cannot be waived by MetLife unless agreed to in writing by an officer of MetLife. Failure to strictly enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such provision or release either party from its obligation to perform strictly in accordance with such provision. While you are required to return your original signature below to MetLife, you acknowledge and agree that a facsimile of your signature shall be deemed to be binding upon you, unless prohibited by law.  
     I have carefully read this Agreement and I understand it. I acknowledge that I have been given a copy of this Agreement.

Exhibit 10.29 
  MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE SHARE AGREEMENT    
       MetLife, Inc. confirms that, on   [grant date]   (the  Grant Date ), it granted you,   [name]  ,   [number]   Performance Shares (your  Performance Shares ). Your Performance Shares are subject to the terms and conditions of this Management Performance Share Agreement (this  Agreement ) and the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the  Plan ).  
         1.   Standard Performance Terms  .    
       (a) The terms of this Section 1 shall be referred to as the  Standard Performance Terms  and will apply to your Performance Shares except in so far as Sections 2 (Change of Status) or 3 (Change of Control) apply.  
       (b) The Performance Period for your Performance Shares will begin on   [date]  ,   [year]   and end on the December 31 immediately preceding the third anniversary of the beginning of the Performance Period. After the conclusion of the Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing the number of Performance Shares payable in accordance with this Section 1 (your  Final Performance Shares ), and your Final Performance Shares will be due and payable in Shares at the time specified in Section 8.  
       (c) If the Committee determines in writing that the Company met one or more of the Section 162(m) Goals, then you will be eligible for a payment of up to 200% of your Performance Shares. The  Section 162(m) Goals  shall be the following:  
       (1) Positive Company income from continuing operations before provision for income tax, excluding net investment gains (losses) (determined in accordance with Section 3(a) of Article 7.04 of SEC Regulation S-X), which includes total net investment gains (losses) and net derivatives gains (losses), as presented in the financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the calendar year preceding the beginning of the Performance Period ( Adjusted Income ), for the Performance Period.  
       (2) Positive Adjusted Income for the third calendar year of the Performance Period.  
       (3) Positive Company Proportionate Total Shareholder Return for the Performance Period, as defined for the Company in Section 1(d)(2).  
       (4) Positive Company Proportionate Total Shareholder Return for the third calendar year of the Performance Period, as defined for the Company in Section 1(d)(2) with respect to the third calendar year of the Performance Period.  
       (d) If, under Section 1(c), you are eligible for a payment, the Committee will determine your Final Performance Shares by multiplying your Performance Shares by the  Performance Factor.  The Performance Factor means a percentage (from zero to 200%) which is the sum of two other percentages (each from zero to 100%), described in (1) and (2) below, multiplied by the factor determined by (3) below, if applicable.  
       (1) The first percentage will be based on the Company s average percentile performance with respect to Change in Annual Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share during the Performance Period relative to the other companies in the Index, determined in the following manner:  
       (a) First, the Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share will be determined for the Company and for each of the other companies in the Index, for each calendar year of the Performance Period and the calendar immediately preceding the first calendar year of the Performance Period. For this purpose,  Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share  for each calendar year will have the meaning of that term, or its substantial equivalent, defined in or derived from the Company s quarterly financial supplement for the fourth quarter of the prior year filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  
       (b) Second, the Change in Annual Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share will be determined for the Company and for each of the other companies in the Index for each calendar year of the Performance Period. For this purpose,  Change in Annual Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share  means Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share for each calendar year of the Performance Period divided by Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share in the immediately preceding calendar year.  
       (c) Third, the Company s Change in Annual Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share for each calendar year of the Performance Period will be compared to the Change in Annual Net Operating Income Available to Common Shareholders Per Share for each of the other companies in the Index for the same calendar year to determine the percentage of the other companies in the Index whose performance was less than that of the Company, rounded down to the nearest whole number percentile appearing on the left-hand column of Table 1 of Schedule A to this Agreement (Company performance greater than every other company in the Index being deemed  

to be performance in the ninety-ninth percentile), producing the Company s percentile performance relative to the other companies in the Index.  
       (d) Fourth, a percentage for each calendar year of the Performance Period will be determined using the percentile determined under Section 1(d)(1)(c) and the corresponding percentage on the right-hand column of Table 1 of Schedule A to this Agreement.  
       (e) Finally, the three percentages referenced in Section (1)(d)(1)(d) will be averaged.  
       (2) The second percentage will be based on the Company s performance with respect to Proportionate Total Shareholder Return during the Performance Period as a percentage of that of the Index, determined according to Table 2 of Schedule A to this Agreement, determined in the following manner:  
       (a) First, the Initial Closing Price of the Company and the Index will each be determined. For this purpose,  Initial Closing Price  means, in the case of the Company the average Closing Price, and in the case of the Index the value of the Index, in each case for the twenty (20) trading days prior to the first day of the Performance Period.  
       (b) Second, the Final Closing Price of the Company and the Index will each be determined. For this purpose,  Final Closing Price  means, in the case of the Company the average Closing Price, and in the case of the Index the value of the Index, in each case for the twenty (20) trading days prior to and including the final day of the Performance Period.  
       (c) Third, the Total Shareholder Return of the Company and the Index will each be determined, and expressed as a percentage. For this purpose,  Total Shareholder Return  means the change (plus or minus) from the Initial Closing Price to the Final Closing Price, plus (in the case of the Company) dividends (if any) actually paid on Shares on a reinvested basis from the first day of the Performance Period to and including the last day of the Performance Period.  
       (d) Fourth, the Proportionate Total Shareholder Return of the Company and the Index will each be determined. For this purpose,  Proportionate Total Shareholder Return  means Total Shareholder Return divided by Initial Closing Price.  
       (e) Fifth, the Proportionate Total Shareholder Return of the Index will be subtracted from the Company s Proportionate Total Shareholder Return, and the result rounded up or down to the nearest percentage appearing on the left-hand column of Table 2 of Schedule A to this Agreement (any result precisely halfway between two percentages being rounded up to the next highest percentage).  
       (f) Finally, a percentage will be determined using the result produced under Section 1(d)(2)(e) and the corresponding percentage on the right-hand column of Table 2 of Schedule A to this Agreement.  
       (3) If the Total Shareholder Return of the Company, as determined under Section (1)(d)(2)(c), is zero percent or less, then the sum of the percentages described under Sections (1)(d)(1) and (1)(d)(2) will be multiplied by a factor of seventy-five hundredths (0.75) and rounded up or down to the nearest whole percentage (any result precisely halfway between two percentages being rounded up to the next highest percentage) to determine the Performance Factor.  
       (e) For purposes of Section 1(d)(1), the companies in the Index refers to each company, other than the Company and other than Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (and any company that the Committee determines in its discretion is a successor to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.), that:  
       (1) does not adopt International Financial Reporting Standards with respect to a reporting period earlier than the reporting period with respect to which the Company does so,  
       (2) has publicly reported its earnings in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for each of the two calendar years being compared under Section 1(d)(1)(b); and     
       (3) is included in the Standard   Poor s Insurance Index derived from Fortune 500 companies for the entirety of the second of the two calendar years being compared under Section 1(d)(1)(b).  
       (f) For purposes of Section 1(d)(2), the Index refers to the Standard   Poor s Insurance Index derived from Fortune 500 companies, excluding Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (and any company that the Committee determines in its discretion is a successor to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.), including any weighting of the stock of the companies included in that index that is applied by Standard   Poor s, from time to time.  
         2.   Change of Status  .   For purposes of this Section 2, your transfer between the Company and an Affiliate, or among Affiliates, will not be a termination of employment. In the event of a Change of Control, any applicable terms of Section 3 (Change of Control) will supersede the terms of this Section 2.  
       (a)   Long-Term Disability  . In the event you qualify for long-term disability benefits under a plan or arrangement offered by the Company or an Affiliate for its Employees, the Standard Performance Terms will continue to apply to your Performance Shares. Once this provision applies, no other change of status described in this Section 2 (except  

the provision regarding termination for Cause) will affect your Performance Shares, even if you subsequently return to active service or your employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates other than for Cause.  
       (b)   Death  . In the event that your employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates due to your death, your Performance Shares will be due and payable in Shares (or cash at a value equal to the Closing Price on the date of your death, if so determined by the Committee). Any payment will be made at the time specified in Section 8.  
       (c)   Retirement  . If your employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates (other than for Cause) on after your early retirement date or normal retirement date (in each case determined under any ERISA qualified pension plan offered by the Company or an Affiliate in which you participate) ( Retirement ), the Standard Performance Terms will continue to apply to your Performance Shares.  
       (d)   Bridge Eligibility  . If your employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates (other than for Cause) with bridge eligibility for retirement-related medical benefits (determined under an ERISA qualified benefit plan offered by the Company or an Affiliate in which you participate, if any) ( Bridge Eligibility ), and your separation agreement (offered to you under the severance program offered by the Company or an Affiliate to its Employees) becomes final, the Standard Performance Terms will continue to apply to your Performance Shares.  
       (e)   Termination for Cause  . In the event that your employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates for Cause, your Performance Shares will be forfeited immediately.  
       (f)   Other Termination of Employment  . Unless the Committee determines otherwise, if no other provision in this Section 2 regarding change of status applies, including, for example, your voluntary termination of employment, your termination without Retirement or Bridge Eligibility, or your termination by the Company or an Affiliate without Cause, your Performance Shares will be forfeited immediately unless you are offered a separation agreement by the Company or an Affiliate under a severance program. To the extent your separation agreement becomes final, your Prorated Performance Shares will be due and payable to you. Any payment will be made at the time specified in Section 8. The number of your  Prorated Performance Shares  will be determined by dividing the number of calendar months in the Performance Period that have ended as of the end of the month of the termination of your employment by thirty-six (36), multiplying the result by the number of your Performance Shares, and rounding to the nearest whole number, and, if you were an Insider or an  executive officer  of the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder, at any time during the Performance Period, further multiplying the result by the lesser of 100% or the Performance Factor;   provided, however  , that if the date of the termination of your employment is prior to the first anniversary of the beginning of the Performance Period, then the number of your Prorated Performance Shares shall be zero (0). Payment for each of your Prorated Performance Shares will be made in cash at a value equal to the Closing Price on the Grant Date, and shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundred dollars ($100.00);   provided, however  , that if you were an Insider or an  executive officer  of the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder, at any time during the Performance Period, payment for each of your Prorated Performance Shares will be made in cash at a value equal to the lesser of the Closing Price on the Grant Date or the Closing Price on the date the Committee determines the Performance Factor, and shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundred dollars ($100.00). If your separation agreement does not become final, your Performance Shares will be forfeited.  
         3.   Change of Control  .    
       (a) Except as provided in Section 3(b), and unless otherwise prohibited under law or by applicable rules of a national security exchange, if a Change of Control occurs, your Performance Shares will be due and payable in the form of cash equal to the number of your Performance Shares multiplied by the Change of Control Price. Any payment will be made at the time specified in Section 8.  
       (b) The terms of Section 3(a) will not apply to your Performance Shares if the Committee reasonably determines in good faith, prior to the Change of Control, that you have been granted an Alternative Award for your Performance Shares pursuant to Section 15.2 of the Plan. Any such Alternative Award shall not accelerate the timing of payment or otherwise violate Code Section 409A.  
         4.   Nontransferability of Awards  .   Except as provided in Section 5 or as otherwise permitted by the Committee, you may not sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise alienate or hypothecate any of your Performance Shares, and all rights with respect to your Performance Shares are exercisable during your lifetime only by you.  
         5.   Beneficiary Designation  .   You may name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) who may then exercise any right under this Agreement in the event of your death. Each beneficiary designation for such purpose will revoke all such prior designations. Beneficiary designations must be properly completed on a form prescribed by the Committee and must be filed with the Company during your lifetime. If you  

have not designated a beneficiary, your rights under this Agreement will pass to and may be exercised by your estate.  
         6.   Tax Withholding  .   The Company will withhold from payment made under this Agreement an amount sufficient to satisfy the minimum statutory Federal, state, and local tax withholding requirements relating to payment on account of your Performance Shares.     
         7.   Adjustments  .   The Committee will make appropriate adjustments in the terms and conditions of your Performance Shares in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or its financial statements (such as a Common Stock dividend, Common Stock split, recapitalization, payment of an extraordinary dividend, merger, consolidation, combination, spin-off, distribution of assets to stockholders other than ordinary cash dividends, exchange of shares, or other similar corporate change), or in recognition of changes to applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, to prevent unintended dilution or enlargement of the potential benefits of your Performance Shares. The Committee s determinations in this regard will be conclusive.  
         8.   Timing of Payment  .    
       (a) This Agreement is intended to comply with Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted accordingly. If Shares are to be paid to you, you will receive evidence of ownership of those Shares.  
       (b) If payment is due and payable under Section 2(b), it will be made upon your death.  
       (c) If payment is due and payable under Section 2(f), it will be made six (6) months after the termination of your employment (or six (6) months after your  separation from service  under Code Section 409A, if that is a different date);   provided, however  , that if you were an Insider or an  executive officer  of the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder, at any time during the Performance Period, payment will be made in the calendar year after the end of the Performance Period but in no event earlier than six (6) months after the termination of your employment (or six months after your  separation from service  under Code Section 409A, if that is a different date).  
       (d) If payment is due and payable under Section 3(a), and the Change of Control that causes payment to be due and payable is a  change of control  as defined under Code Section 409A, such sum shall be paid to you within thirty (30) days of the Change of Control. If payment is due and payable under Section 3(a), and the Change of Control that causes payment to be due and payable is not a  change of control  as defined under Code Section 409A, such sum shall be paid to you at the time determined under Section 8(e).  
       (e) If payment is due and payable under the Standard Performance Terms and you have chosen to defer payment under an applicable deferred compensation plan offered by the Company or an Affiliate, payment will be made at the time determined under that plan. If payment is due and payable under the Standard Performance Terms and you have not chosen to defer payment under an applicable deferred compensation plan offered by the Company or an Affiliate, payment will be made in the calendar year after the end of the Performance Period.  
         9.   Closing Price  .   For purpose of this Agreement,  Closing Price  will mean the closing price of a Share as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system for the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other recognized quotation system on which the trading prices of the Shares are quoted at the relevant time), or in the event that there are no Share transactions reported on such tape or other system on the applicable date, the closing price on the immediately preceding date on which Share transactions were reported. Closing Price shall constitute  Fair Market Value  under the Plan for all purposes related to your Performance Shares.  
         10.   No Guarantee of Employment  .   This Agreement is not a contract of employment and it is not a guarantee of employment for life or any period of time. Nothing in this Agreement interferes with or limits in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate your employment at any time. This Agreement does not give you any right to continue in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate.  
         11.   Governing Law; Choice of Forum  .   This Agreement will be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the law that might be applied under principles of conflict of laws. Any action to enforce this Agreement or any action otherwise regarding this Agreement must be brought in a court in the State of New York, to which jurisdiction the Company and you consent.  
         12.   Miscellaneous  .   For purposes of this Agreement,  Committee  includes any direct or indirect delegate of the Committee as defined in the Plan and (unless otherwise indicated) the word  Section  refers to a Section in this Agreement. Any other capitalized word used in this Agreement and not defined in this Agreement, including each form of that word, is defined in the Plan. Any determination or interpretation by the Committee pursuant to this Agreement will be final and conclusive. In the event of a conflict between any term of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan control. This Agreement and the Plan represent the entire agreement between you and the Company, and you and all Affiliates, regarding your Performance Shares. No promises, terms, or agreements  

of any kind regarding your Performance Shares that are not set forth, or referred to, in this Agreement or in the Plan are part of this Agreement. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held illegal or invalid, the rest of this Agreement will remain enforceable. If you are an Employee of an Affiliate, your Performance Shares are being provided to you by the Company on behalf of that Affiliate, and the value of your Performance Shares will be considered a compensation obligation of that Affiliate. Your Performance Shares are not Shares and do not give you the rights of a holder of Shares. You will not be credited with additional Performance Shares on account of any dividend paid on Shares. The issuance of Shares or payment of cash pursuant to your Performance Shares is subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to any approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. No Shares will be issued or no cash will be paid if that issuance or payment would result in a violation of applicable law, including the federal securities laws and any applicable state or foreign securities laws. Your Performance Shares are subject to the Company s performance-based compensation recoupment policy (which currently covers only officers or officer-equivalent employees of the Company and its Affiliates) in effect from time to time.  
    
         13.   Amendments  .   The Committee has the exclusive right to amend this Agreement as long as the amendment does not adversely affect any of your previously-granted Awards in any material way (without your written consent) and is otherwise consistent with the Plan. The Company will give written notice to you (or, in the event of your death, to your beneficiary or estate) of any amendment as promptly as practicable after its adoption.     
         14.   Agreement to Protect Corporate Property  .   If you have not previously executed an Agreement to Protect Corporate Property ( Property Agreement ), the grant of your Performance Shares is subject to your execution of the Property Agreement provided to you by the Company with respect to this Agreement, and if you do not return a signed copy of the Property Agreement then this Agreement and the Performance Shares granted to you will be void. The Company may in its sole discretion allow an extension of time for you to return your signed Property Agreement.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused its duly authorized officer to execute this Agreement, and you have executed this Agreement.

  METROPOLITAN LIFE AUXILIARY  
  SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN  
  (Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2008)  
  1. Section 2.1 of the Plan is hereby amended as follows:  
   2.1  Administrative Participant  means any Participant in the Plan who is not classified by the Company as a Commissioned Participant.   
  2. There is hereby added to the end of Section 4.9 a new subsection to be known as subsection (c). Subsection (c) shall provide as follows:  
        (c)   Effect of Rehire As Administrative Participant  . In the event that an Administrative Participant has experienced a Termination of Employment and is later rehired by the Company, his or her rights with respect to any election made under this Section shall be determined as follows:  
       (1) If such Participant made an election under subsection (b) of this Section prior to his or her Termination of Employment, whether or not payments under this Plan in accordance with such election had commenced prior to the date of his or her reemployment by the Company, then payments will commence when scheduled in accordance with the terms of such Participant s election or continue if such payments have already commenced. Upon such Participant s reemployment any Company Contributions allocated to such Participant s Account under this Plan will be included as part of future payments under such election. Following the distribution of the final payment in accordance with such Participant s election, such Participant s election of the time and form of distribution will be governed solely by subsection (a), unless such Participant makes a subsequent election in accordance with subsection (b). Any Company Contributions allocated to the Participant s Account following the distribution of the final payment in accordance with the Participant s election shall be retained in such Participant s Account until such Participant s subsequent Termination of Employment, at which time distribution of such Participant s Account shall commence, either in accordance with subsection (a) or subsection (b).  
       (2) If such Participant has not made an election in accordance with subsection (b) at the time of his or her Termination of Employment, then she or he will receive his or her Account under this Plan in the Default Mode of Payment at the Default Commencement Date, notwithstanding the fact that such Participant is reemployed by the Company prior to the Default Commencement Date. If Company Contributions are allocated to such Participant s Account following the date of his or her Termination of Employment, but prior to the Default Commencement Date, such Contributions will be included in the Default Mode of Payment. Once such Participant has received a final distribution of his or her Account under subsection (a), any Company Contributions which are allocated to such Participant s Account following his or her final payment shall then be distributed following his or her subsequent Termination of Employment in accordance with subsection (a), unless such Participant makes an election in accordance with subsection (b).   
  3. Section 8.2(b) of the Plan is hereby amended as follows:  
        (b)   Limitations of Time for Submitting Claims and Suits Challenging Denial of Claims  .

  4. This Amendment shall become effective on January 1, 2010.

                           COMPENSATION PLAN FOR OFFICERS 
                  (As amended and restated as of November 1, 2003) 
    
        WHEREAS, the MetLife Deferred Compensation Plan for Officers, as last amended and restated November 1, 2003 (the "PLAN"), was adopted to permit certain eligible employees voluntarily to defer the payment of certain types of compensation; 
    
        WHEREAS, certain other nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements have been entered into with employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan, which arrangements either expressly or implicitly incorporate aspects of the Plan, and/or are otherwise administered, in whole or in part, in a manner consistent with the administration of the Plan; 
    
        WHEREAS, to facilitate the administration of such other arrangements, it has been recommended that such arrangements be incorporated into the Plan (cognizant of the need to preserve the differences from the Plan terms mandated by such arrangements, including, but not limited to, in order to avoid subjecting the amounts deferred under such arrangements and the Plan to the additional taxes imposed under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended); 
    
        WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 20 of the Plan, the Plan Administrator has reserved the right to amend the Plan; 
    
        NOW, THEREFORE, the Plan is hereby amended in the manner set forth below: 
    
        1.    Section 2 is amended to add a new Section 2.7 at the end thereof, to read as follows: 
    
              2.7. The Plan Administrator may permit other non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements between an Eligible Associate and any MetLife Company or an affiliate of any MetLife Company, whether or not elective, to be administered under and treated as part of the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall establish a separate Alternative Compensation Account for an Eligible Associate who is party to a non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement treated as part of the Plan. Unless otherwise specified herein, on Annex I or by the Plan Administrator in writing, the general provisions of the Plan shall apply to any such Alternative Compensation Account, including without limitation, those provisions related to (i) the value of the Alternative Contribution Account (including the Investment Tracking of such Account), (ii) the timing, number and form of payments from such Account and (iii) the designation of any beneficiary(ies) to receive payment from such Account upon the death of the Participant. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement as in effect on October 3, 2004, no distribution shall be made from any Alternative Contribution Account pursuant to Section 12, 13 or 14 of the Plan. 
    
        2.    Section 10 is amended to add a new Section 10.3.11 at the end of Section 10.3 thereof, to read as follows: 
    
              10.3.11. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.3 to the contrary, payment in respect of any Alternative Compensation Account shall not be accelerated from the date payment would have been made under the corresponding nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement, as identified on Annex I or as otherwise specified in writing by the Plan Administrator. 

3.    Section 21 is amended to new Sections 21.2 and 21.3 thereto, to read as follows, and to appropriately renumber all other sections thereof to reflect the addition of such Section: 
    
              21.2  "Alternative Compensation Account" means a record-keeping account established for the benefit of an Eligible Associate in which is credited such amounts of compensation as are deferred under the nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement to which such Account relates. 
    
              21.3  "Annex I" means the schedule established by the Plan Administrator, as the same may be amended by the Plan Administrator at any time and from time to time, on which is specified the terms of any non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement that is to be administered as part of the Plan that deviate from the general terms of the Plan. Annex I, as in effect from time to time, is expressly incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. 
    
        4.    Section 21 is further amended to add a new second sentence to 
  Section 21.11 (as renumbered pursuant to item 3 of this Amendment), "Deferred Compensation Account", to read as follows: 
    
              To the extent the context so requires, the term Deferred Compensation Account, as applied to any Participant, shall also include any Alternative Compensation Account established for the benefit of such Participant. 
    
        5.    Section 21 is further amended to add a new second sentence at the end of Section 21.23 (as renumbered pursuant to item 3 of this Amendment), "Participant", to read as follows: 
    
              To the extent that the context so requires, the term Participant shall also include any Eligible Associate for whose benefit an Alternative Compensation Account has been established under the Plan. 
    
        6.    The Plan is further amended to add at the end thereof of a new Annex I, as is attached hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. 
    
        7.    Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Plan shall continue in full force and affect, without amendment. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this amendment shall, or shall be construed to, amend or modify any provision or term of the Plan with respect to amounts otherwise credited thereunder immediately prior to the execution of this Amendment. 
    
        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the amendment to the MetLife Deferred Compensation Plan has been executed by the Plan Administrator thereof, on this 4th day of May, 2005.

  Deferred Compensation Plan 

Program Description and Plan Document 
  November 2012 

Important Notices 
  This Program   Description   provides   an overview   of the MetLife   Non-Management Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan").   It is also the official plan document that legally governs the Plan.    This Plan document will govern in every respect and instance, and replaces and supersedes prior Plan documents. 
  This Program Description may be updated from time to time to implement changes in the Plan.  Fund performance data will be updated periodically.  These updates will constitute part of the Prospectus distributed with respect to the Plan. 
  The Plan Administrator may amend, alter or terminate the Plan in accordance with its terms at any time and for any reason. 
  The Plan was effective on January 1, 2005, and the Plan will continue in effect until it is amended, suspended, or terminated according to its terms. 
  This Plan was designed to replace the MetLife Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors and Article VII of the MetLife, Inc. 2000 Directors Stock Plan, respectively, beginning with 2005 compensation deferrals; earlier deferrals will remain governed by the earlier plans. 
  MetLife, Inc. will have the obligation to pay amounts deferred under the Plan.  MetLife, Inc.'s obligations are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Since this is an unfunded plan, your rights or claims against assets or property are no greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of MetLife, Inc. 
  Your  deferrals  may  gain  or lose  value  over  time;  see "Investment Tracking  For Your Deferred  Cash  Accounts"  and  "MetLife Deferred  Stock  Accounts"  below.  Shares of MetLife, Inc. common  stock  paid  under  the  Plan  may  be  shares  of treasury  common stock, authorized but unissued common stock, or shares obtained on the open market. 
  This document constitutes part of a prospectus covering securities that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

MetLife Non-Management Director Deferred Compensation     Plan 
    
  The MetLife Non-Management Director Deferred Compensation  Plan (the "Plan")  allows eligible directors to defer receiving a portion of their retainer fees paid in cash or shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock ("MetLife Stock")  for services in  2005 and thereafter, thereby deferring payment of federal and most state income taxes until a later date when the deferred payments are received.  Participation in     the Plan is completely voluntary. 
    
  The Plan is a nonqualified plan that is unfunded and subject to the risks described in this document.  Amounts credited to an account are solely for recordkeeping purposes.  The Plan is not subject to protection under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and is not a qualified plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a). 
    
  Eligibility 
  Members of the Board of Directors of MetLife, Inc. (the "Board") who are not employees of MetLife, Inc. or any of its affiliates ("Non-Management Directors") are eligible to participate.  In this Program Description, "you" refers to a director who is eligible to participate in the Plan. 
    
  Making a Deferral Election 
  Incumbent Directors   - Prior to the calendar year in  which retainer fees will be paid to you for services you provide as a Non-Management Director, the Plan Administrator may offer you the opportunity  to defer all or a portion of the retainer fees paid as compensation  for such services.  Elections to defer cash retainer fees and/or stock retainer fees paid in 2013 will carry over from year to year. You will be notified of your current elections during the enrollment period, prior to the beginning of each calendar year and will have the opportunity to change your 
  election at that time. If you do not change your elections during the enrollment period, then at the end of the enrollment period, your elections will become irrevocable and will continue to apply to the retainer fees paid to you in the subsequent calendar year. 
    
  New Directors   - In general, you may defer all or a portion of your retainer fees for services in the calendar year you are appointed to the Board by submitting a deferral election offered to you by the Plan Administrator by the   earlier of  : 
    
       the day before the first Directors meeting following your appointment  or, 
       the thirtieth (30   th   ) day after your appointment. 
    
  If a Directors meeting occurs before the thirtieth (30   th   ) day after your appointment and before you have filed a deferral election, then, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, you may defer a prorated portion of your fees.  The proration will be determined according to the number of scheduled meetings for the year of your appointment. You must submit your deferral election no later than the thirtieth (30   th   ) day after your appointment. 
    
  All Directors   - To defer your cash retainer fees, you need to complete the deferral election form offered to you by the Plan Administrator specifying: 

The percentage of your cash retainer fees you want deferred into a Deferred Cash Account (if you choose to defer any of your cash fees, your deferral for the immediately subsequent calendar year must equal at least $1 0,000); 
       
    Page 4 

The investment tracking funds that will be used to adjust the value of that Deferred Cash 
  Account; and 
              
    A future distribution date and number of payments for that Deferred Cash Account (paid in cash). 
       
  To defer your MetLife Stock retainer fees, you need to complete a deferral election form specifying: 
    
        The percentage of your MetLife Stock retainer fees you want deferred into a MetLife 
  Deferred Stock Account; and 
              
    The future distribution date and number of payments for your MetLife Deferred Stock Account. 
       
  Your deferral election form must be submitted during the enrollment period.  If you submit an election form that does not specify when payment is to be made, payment will be made upon the termination of your service as a Non-Management Director.  If you submit an election form that does not specify the number of installments in which payment should be made, payment will be made in a single lump sum. 
    
  Before making your elections, you may wish to consult a tax or personal financial advisor regarding all of the ramifications of deferral of compensation. 
  All deferrals are subject to the terms of this Plan. 
  Income Taxes 
  Deferred compensation is not subject to current taxation under federal and most state 
  income tax laws at the time it is deferred.  However, income and self-employment taxes 
  will be due at the time payment is made.  Consult your financial advisor with any questions regarding how and when you should make payment of your tax obligations arising from payments under the Plan.  Note that amounts paid under the Plan may not be rolled-over into an IRA, qualified plan or another nonqualified plan. 
    
  Neither MetLife, Inc. nor any of its affiliates will be entitled to claim a tax deduction for any compensation (plus earnings) the payment of which is deferred under the terms of this Plan until the taxable period in which the payments are includible in the taxable income of a participant.  The deduction can be claimed only in the amount that such income is included in such participant's income. 
    
  Deferral Amounts 
  If you choose to defer any of your cash retainer fees, your deferral for the immediately subsequent calendar year must be at least $10,000. 
    
  Once you elect your deferral amount, you may not change it for the year immediately subsequent to the election, unless the Plan Administrator determines that you qualify for hardship treatment.  The Plan Administrator may suspend deferrals in cases of extreme hardship as provided   in   the Plan.  See "Hardship Exceptions," below.  Changes for later periods, to the extent covered by the election, may be allowed by the Plan Administrator, subject to Legal Deferral Requirements. 
    
    Page 5 

Deferred Compensation Accounts 
  If you defer any or all of your cash retainer fees, a Deferred Cash Account in your name for that year's deferrals will be established for recordkeeping purposes.  If you defer any of your MetLife Stock retainer fees, a MetLife Deferred Stock Account in your name for that year's deferrals will be established for recordkeeping purposes. You will receive account statements annually. 
    
  Your accounts will be credited effective on the date on which your retainer fees would have been paid had you not elected to defer receipt of such retainer fees. 
    
  Investment Tracking For Your Deferred Cash Accounts 
  Investment tracking funds are used as a device for adjusting the value of your Deferred Cash Accounts, from the time contributions are made until the time payments are made from your Deferred Cash Accounts, based on fund performance. 
    
  Each investment tracking fund reflects the investment returns of the actual fund or index, including any management fees and/or other expenses that apply to the actual fund.  Returns are measured each day the relevant stock exchange is open.  Your account will fluctuate based on the fund's performance (gains or losses) in effect "mirroring" the performance of the specified fund or index, determined on a Total Return basis. "Total Return" reflects the change (plus or minus) in price or value, plus dividends (if any) on a reinvested basis.  Your deferred cash account will not actually be invested in the funds.  If the aggregate performance of the funds mirrored by the investment tracking funds you choose is positive, the value of your account will increase; if it is negative, the value of your account will decrease. 
    
  You may change your investment tracking funds- either with regard to future deferrals or your existing account- at any time during the year by accessing the Plan's website or by calling the participant service center.  However, you may make no more than six changes per calendar year. For this purpose, all changes submitted on the same day will count as a single change. You can elect to track your account against one or more of the investment tracking funds, and fund allocations must be made in multiples of 5%.  If you have provided your e  mail address, you will receive confirmation of your changes shortly after they are made. 
    
  Under MetLife's Insider Trading Policy, active Directors are required to obtain pre-clearance from the MetLife Corporate Secretary before transferring funds into or out of the MetLife Common Stock Fund or changing the percentage of future deferred fees that will be allocated to the MetLife Common Stock Fund. 
    
  Detailed information about the available investment tracking funds will be provided to you. This will include descriptions and historic performance. The Plan Administrator may change, eliminate or replace any investment tracking fund or index at any time. When the Plan Administrator has determined to make a change, you will be informed and you will be given an opportunity to change your investment tracking selections to the extent they are affected by the change.

MetLife Deferred Stock Accounts 
  Your MetLife Deferred Stock Accounts will reflect the number of shares of MetLife Stock you deferred, plus imputed reinvested dividends (on the same basis as such dividends are paid on actual shares of MetLife Stock). 
    
  The value of your MetLife Deferred Stock Account will depend on the price of MetLife Stock, which is affected by market conditions and other factors, such as declared dividends. As a result, the value of your MetLife Deferred Stock Account is anticipated to have a relatively high risk profile. 
    
  Your MetLife Deferred Stock Accounts will be appropriately adjusted (as determined by the Governance Committee of the Board, or its successor) in the event of any MetLife Stock dividend, MetLife Stock split, recapitalization (including, but not limited, to the payment of an extraordinary  dividend), merger, consolidation,  combination, or spin-off affecting MetLife, Inc. capitalization,  distribution  of MetLife, Inc. assets to holders of MetLife Stock (other than ordinary cash dividends),  exchange of shares, or other similar corporate change. 
    
  The performance of MetLife Deferred Stock Account will be identical to that of the MetLife Common Stock Fund, and is labeled the "MetLife Deferred Shares Fund" in the "Total Return Historic Fund       Index Performance by Calendar Year" chart. 
    
  Distribution Dates 
  For each of your Deferred Cash Accounts and your MetLife Deferred Stock Accounts, you may choose to have your distributions begin either (1) on a specific date no less than three years after the year of deferral, or (2) upon the termination of your service as a Non  Management Director of MetLife, Inc. (the date of your termination of service will be determined in accordance with Legal Deferral Requirements). If you choose to receive your account on a specific date, your account will be paid to you on the earlier of (a) the date you selected, or (b) on the date of the termination of your service as a director. 
    
  Once you have designated a distribution date, you cannot change it except as described below under "Changing the Distribution Date and/or Number of Payments." 
    
  Number of Payments 
  You may elect to receive each of your account balances in either a lump-sum payment or up to 15 annual installments.  For each of your Deferred Cash Accounts, each annual installment will be a fraction of the account's cash value with one being the numerator and the number of payments remaining being the denominator. For each of your MetLife Deferred Stock Accounts, each annual installment will be a fraction of the number of shares of MetLife Stock represented in the account, with one being the numerator and the number of payments remaining being the denominator and disregarding any fraction of a share until the last installment.  For example, if you elect to receive 10 annual payments, the first payment is equal to 1/10   th    of the account; the second payment is equal to 1/9   th    of the account; and so on until final payment is made.  For purposes of Legal Deferral Requirements, any payment option selected under this plan will be considered to be a single payment form of benefit. 
    
    Page 7 

Form of Payments 
  All payments from your Deferred Cash Accounts (including portions allocated to the MetLife Common Stock investment tracking fund) will be made in cash.  All payments from your MetLife Deferred Stock Account will be made in MetLife Stock, except that fractional shares will be paid in cash at the Closing Price of MetLife Stock on the date of payment.* 
    
  Changing the Distribution Date and/or Number of Payments 
  For each of your Deterred Cash Account and your MetLife Deferred Stock Account for a given year, you may make changes only once on the form offered to you by the Plan Administrator, at which time you may change either or both: 
    
  1.  the date you previously elected to receive payment of your deferred compensation  to a date at least five (5) years later than your original election; and/or 
  2.   the number of payments you have chosen to receive (your change may increase or decrease the number of payments and must also delay payment for at least five (5) years from the original date elected). 
    
  You must make all changes to any particular account at the same time; and your changes will only become effective if you submit them no later than one year before the original date you had selected for payment and remain an active Director for at least another 6 years from the date your changes are submitted. Otherwise, such changes will not become effective.  All changes will be effective to the extent consistent with Legal Deferral Requirements. 
    
  Please note that elections for deferred payments on a fixed date will only be honored if you are still providing services as a Director as of the date that your deferred amounts become payable under your election.  All deterred amounts whose payment election dates have not been reached as of the date that you are no longer providing services as a Director are paid as soon as administratively  practical after your service as a Director ends.  This is true even for re-deferral elections made in accordance with the procedures described above. 
    
  Payment to Beneficiaries 
  If you die before your distributions begin or are completed, the balance in your accounts will be paid as a single lump sum to your beneficiary.  If you have not designated a beneficiary, or your beneficiary (or beneficiaries) die(s) before you do, the balance in your accounts will be paid to your estate. 
    
  You may designate an individual, entity, trustee, or your estate as your beneficiary, and you may change your beneficiary at any time.  Each beneficiary designation will apply to all of your deferrals under the Plan, and will supersede your previous beneficiary designations. Unless or until you submit a new beneficiary designation form, your last beneficiary designation (if any) under the MetLife Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors 
    
  __________________ 
  ' "Closing Price" means the closing price of a share of MetLife Stock as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system for the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other recognized quotation system on which the trading prices of shares of MetLife  Stock are quoted at the relevant time) on such date.  In the event that there are no transactions of MetLife Stock reported on such tape (or such other system) on such date, Closing Price shall mean the closing price on the immediately preceding date on which MetLife Stock transactions were so reported.

(or, if you have not designated  a beneficiary  under that plan, the beneficiary  you have designated under the MetLife, Inc. 2000 Directors Stock Plan, if any) will apply under this Plan. 
    
  You may update or designate your beneficiary(ies) during each enrollment period.  If you wish to change your beneficiary designations during the year you may do so by accessing the Plan recordkeeper's website or by calling the Participant Service Center. 
    
  Loans 
  No loans may be taken from your accounts. 
    
  Hardship Exceptions 
  In cases of extreme hardship, and consistent  with Legal Deferral Requirements for deferral of income taxation, the Plan Administrator may suspend deferrals or make payments to you, reducing the value of your account.  However, the total amount suspended and advanced cannot exceed the amount required to satisfy the financial consequences of the hardship and   tax   withholding requirements. 
    
  Unfunded, Unsecured Obligations of MetLife, Inc. 
  Deferrals under the Plan are unfunded and unsecured obligations of MetLife, Inc.  Your rights are those of a general unsecured creditor of MetLife, Inc.  The Plan is intended to be designed and administered in complete accordance with Legal Deferral Requirements, but in no event will MetLife, Inc., any affiliate, or the Plan be liable for any taxes, penalties, or other losses on account of the Plan or its administration failing to comply with Legal Deferral Requirements.  The total amount of deferrals under the Plan will depend on participant elections.  There are no fees charged to you for participation in the Plan. 
    
  Assignment 
  No assignment, hypothecation, or pledge of the right to receive the payment of amounts deferred or any other rights under the Plan may be made.  The Plan does not provide for the creation of a lien on any account. 
    
  Qualified Domestic Relations Orders ("QDROs") 
  Deferred compensation will be distributed or attached to the extent required by a QDRO. 
    
  Plan Administrator 
  The Plan is administered by a Plan Administrator who may establish, amend or rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan.  The Plan Administrator of this Plan is also the Plan Administrator of the Metropolitan Life Retirement Plan for U.S. Employees.   The Plan Administrator acts through an individual who is an employee of an affiliate of MetLife, Inc. and an officer of one or more affiliates of MetLife, Inc.  The Employee Benefits Committee of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company appoints the Plan Administrator of the Retirement Plan, who serves until such time as the Committee appoints a new Plan Administrator. 
    
  To the extent consistent with law, including Legal Deferral Requirements, the Plan Administrator may amend, modify, suspend, or terminate the Plan at any time and for any reason.  The Plan Administrator may not amend, modify or terminate the Plan in a way that will reduce the amount that has been accrued in your deferred compensation account prior to the effective date of the amendment, modification or termination. 
    
    Page 9 

The determinations and interpretations of the Plan made by the Plan Administrator shall be final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes under the Plan.  The Plan Administrator may prescribe forms for participants to take action authorized or allowed under the Plan and may appoint agents and consult legal counsel and other professionals to assist in administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator may, in his or her discretion, adjust the value of a deferred compensation account on a basis other than as prescribed in deferral or reallocation elections, including but not limited to the use of investment tracking funds other than those selected by the participant.  The Plan Administrator will administer any claims under the Plan by following Section 503 of ERISA, any applicable regulations, and any other procedures the Plan Administrator adopts. 
    
  The Plan Administrator may reject or reform a deferral election on any lawful basis, and may conform any provision of the Plan to Legal Deferral Requirements.  Where consistent with such requirements, the Plan Administrator may pay deferred compensation regardless of the participant's election for payment at another time. 
    
  Additional Information 
  Additional information about the Plan will be provided to you from time to time.  To the extent that information is part of a prospectus for the Plan, it will include a notice to that effect.

  AMENDMENT NUMBER FIVE TO THE  
  METLIFE AUXILIARY PENSION PLAN  
  (As amended and restated effective January 1, 2008)  
       The MetLife Auxiliary Pension Plan is hereby amended, effective January 1, 2010, as follows:  
  1. Part I, Article 4, Section 4.6, the first paragraph of subsection (b) shall be amended to read as follows:  
                    (b) 
      
    The annual variable incentive component ( AVIC ) of the Participant s Final Average Compensation representing the MetLife Annual Variable Incentive Plan or successor annual cash bonus plan or program shall have the same meaning given to this term under the Retirement Plan. However, this component of Final Average Compensation will be determined using the average of the Participant s highest 5 annual variable incentives (not necessarily consecutive) with respect to the 10 annual variable incentives preceding such Participant s date of Retirement or termination (including any projected payment(s) to be made beyond the Participant s date of Retirement or termination calculated as provided immediately below).  

2. Part I, Article 4, Section 4.6, the second paragraph of subsection (b) through the end of subsection (b) shall be amended to read as follows:  
   The AVIC, as set forth in subsection (b) immediately above, projected to be made beyond the Participant s date of Retirement or termination will be deemed equal to the result of the following calculation, as determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion:  
                       
    (i) 
      
    the highest of the last 3 annual variable incentives paid while the Participant was in active Company service multiplied by 

(ii) 
      
    a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months (or part thereof) that the Participant was actively employed in the calendar year(s) for which the annual variable incentive would be payable and the denominator of which is 12. 

(iii) 
      
    If the fraction determined under (ii) immediately above, is less than 1, then, the fractional amount determined under (ii) shall replace an equivalent fractional amount in the lowest of the 5 highest annual variable incentives used in (b) above. This replacement shall occur only if the fractional amount determined under (ii) is greater than the fractional amount it is replacing in the lowest of the 5 highest annual variable incentives. 

Notwithstanding (b)(i), (ii) and (iii), if a specific amount of annual variable incentive was already approved under its respective plan, prior to the Participant s date of Retirement or termination, such amount shall be used instead of the deemed estimate, and such amount shall also be taken into account in determining the highest of the Participant s last 3 annual variable incentives with regard to any annual variable incentive payable for the Participant s year of Retirement or termination.  
  If, at the time of Retirement or termination, fewer than 5 annual variable incentives have been made to a Participant, then the annual variable incentive component of Final Average Compensation shall be the average of all annual variable incentives actually made to the Participant and the projected payment (described above) for the year of Retirement or termination.  
  For an eligible Participant who is a Commissioned Employee Final Average Compensation will be the amount described in appropriate provisions of the Retirement Plan.  
  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 4.6, Final Average Compensation that can be taken into account to determine each Participant s benefit under this Plan cannot exceed $4.6 million.   

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Amendment to be adopted in its name and behalf this 21   st    day of December, 2010, by its officer thereunto duly authorized.

1. 
    GENERAL INFORMATION 
      The Plan covers medical treatment provided by registered medical practitioners and medical practices that are recognized by the World Health Organisation. Chinese Herbalist and Bonesetters who are Registered Chinese medicine practitioners under the Chinese Medicine Ordinance of the Hong Kong SAR or duly qualified practitioner of Chinese Medicine registered as such under the laws of the country you receive such treatment are also covered. 
    
  The Plan provides 24-hour worldwide coverage and gives you the flexibility to choose in which country   within your geographical zone  , hospital and clinic to have your treatment. Medical expenses resulting from an accident or unforeseeable illness occurring during travel in excluded countries (if applicable) are covered. In respect of hospitalisation, you   must   follow the procedures set out in section 2.2. The emergency assistance coverage is only applicable to overseas trips that do not exceed   90 days   per trip. 
    
   You are required to submit the following details for each person to be covered:- 
           a) 
    full name; 
              b) 
    date of birth; 
              c) 
    sex; 
              d) 
    nationality; 
              e) 
    employee s bank details, i.e. bank name, bank  address,  account number, account holder s name, swift code and currency (for reimbursement of claims); 
              f)

              g) 
    employee s email address 
        4 

Unless the total number of employees covered in your group is greater than 10, each employee member is required to complete a health declaration form (details of each eligible dependant will also need to be declared in the same form), which is then submitted to the Insurer for assessment. Cover will not commence until the application has been accepted by the Insurer. Depending on an individual s medical history, acceptance may include additional exclusions. 
  Each member will receive a Plan membership card which lists out important contact and membership numbers. You should, therefore, carry this card at all times in case you suddenly require medical treatment. These cards must be returned to Jardine Lloyd Thompson Limited (JLT) when you leave service. If you should lose a card, you must report it to JLT at the earliest opportunity. There will be a charge for a replacement card. 
           1.3 
    Dependant's Coverage 
     Provided it has been agreed with your employer, the Plan will cover your spouse and any unmarried children from birth up to the age of 20 years or 25 if they are still in full-time education (proof of full-time education will be required for those over the age of 20). 
    
  After you have joined the Plan, it is your responsibility to notify JLT (via your employer) of any additional eligible dependants. 
    
   You must be under the age of 65 when you first join the Plan. Once a member, cover is renewable until the age of 64.

    Hospitalisation   Planned Admission 
     For any planned confinement, including for childbirth, you must notify the Insurer by asking your attending doctor to promptly complete and return a    Prior Agreement Application - Hospitalisation   . This should be done   at least 10 days before     your admission date. This procedure enables the insurer to assess whether the charges to be incurred are within the reasonable and customary range. At the same time, GMC will arrange for the hospital to send bills directly to the Insurer for settlement. 
    
  A photocopy of the enclosed specimen form can be used. The completed form should be faxed to GMC on Singapore (65) 6849 4092 during office hours. For assistance, you may contact JLT on Hong Kong (852) 2864 5527 or 2864 5390 (facsimile Hong Kong (852) 2529 5333)

Please note that the Supplement includes terms for forfeiture of your Performance Units under some circumstances.  Any payment due under this Agreement may be made by any one or more Affiliates (the  Paying Affiliate ). 
  Standard Terms  .     
  (a)  These terms are the  Standard Terms  and will apply to your Performance Units except in so far as Sections S-2 ( Change of Status ), S-3 ( Change of Control ), or S-16 ( Restrictive Covenants ) apply.   
  (b)  The Performance Period for your Performance Units will begin on     January 1,   [year]   and end on the December 31 immediately preceding the third anniversary of the beginning of the Performance Period.  After the conclusion of the Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing the number of Performance Units payable in accordance with these Standard Terms (your  Final Performance Units ), and your Final Performance Units will be due and payable in cash equal to the Closing Price on the date the Committee determines your Final Performance Units.  Your Final Performance Units will be due and payable at the time specified in Section S-8 ( Timing of Payment ).   
  (c)  If the Committee determines in writing that the Company met one or more of the Section 162(m) Goals, then you will be eligible for a payment of up to 175% of your Performance Units.  Notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement, your payment may not exceed this amount.   
  (d)  If, under Section (c) of these Standard Terms, you are eligible for a payment, the Committee will determine your Final Performance Units by multiplying your Performance Units by the  Final Performance Factor.

  (1)  The first performance factor will be based on the Company s annual performance during the Performance Period with respect to Operating Return on Equity compared to its three-year business plan, as determined by the Committee in its discretion.  In exercising its discretion, the Committee may refer to the guidelines in

Performance Factor Appendix 1 to this Agreement, or such other considerations as it finds appropriate.   
  (2)  The second performance factor will be based on the Company s performance with respect to Total Shareholder Return during the Performance Period compared to the Company s peer companies, as determined by the Committee in its discretion.  In exercising its discretion, the Committee may refer to the list of peer companies and guidelines in Performance Factor Appendix 2 to this Agreement, or such other considerations as it finds appropriate. 
  (3)  In determining the Final Performance Factor in its discretion, the Committee may consider whether the Company s Total Shareholder Return for the Performance Period is zero or less, and if so may, in its discretion, choose to set the Final Performance Factor at the lesser of (a) the average of the percentages determined under Sections (d)(1) and (2) of these Standard Terms; or (b) 100%.

  (c)    Long-Term Disability  .

Once this Section S-2(c) applies, then none of Section S-2(d) ( Death ), Section S-2(e) ( Post-Employment Award Continuation ), or Section S-2(g) ( Other Termination of Employment ) will apply to your Covered Award, even if you subsequently return to active service.  Section 2(f) ( Termination for Cause ) will continue to apply to your Covered Award, and will supersede the terms of this Section 2(c).

  (g)    Other Termination of Employment  .  If none of Sections S-2(c) ( Long Term Disability ), (d) ( Death ), (e) ( Post-Employment Award Continuation ), or (f) ( Termination for Cause ) applies, then:

To the extent your separation agreement becomes final by March 15 of the calendar year after the separation agreement is offered to you, your Prorated Units will be due and payable to you.  The  
    3 

number of your  Prorated Units  will be determined by dividing the number of calendar months, beginning with the month of the Grant Date, that have ended as of the end of the month of the termination of your employment by thirty-six (36), multiplying the result by the number of your Restricted Stock Units or Restricted Units, and rounding to the nearest whole number;   provided, however  , that if the date of the termination of your employment is prior to the first anniversary of the Grant Date, then the number of your Prorated Units shall be zero (0).

The number of your  Prorated Performance Shares/Units  will be determined by dividing the number of calendar months in the Performance Period that have ended as of the end of the month of the termination of your employment by thirty-six (36), multiplying the result by the number of Performance Shares or Performance Units in your Covered Award, and rounding to the nearest whole number, and, if you were an Insider or an  officer  as defined for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (a  Section 16 Officer ) at any time during the Performance Period, further multiplying the result by the lesser of 100% or the Performance Factor;   provided, however  , that if the date of the termination of your employment is prior to the first anniversary of the beginning of the Performance Period, then the number of your Prorated Performance Shares/Units shall be zero (0).

If your separation agreement does not become final, the Performance Shares or Performance Units in your Covered Award will be forfeited.

    9 

Affiliate makes any representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with any aspect of any of your Award, including the grant or payment on account of the Award, and that neither the Company nor any Affiliate commits to structure the terms of the grant of or any aspect of any Award to reduce or eliminate your (or you estate s or any heir s) liability for such tax.

  (1)  the Plan and this Agreement are each established voluntarily by the Company, and that each is discretionary in nature and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, as provided in the Plan and this Agreement, respectively, and such change or the end of your participation in the Plan shall not constitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of your employment or give rise to any liability to you;  
  (2)  the grant of your Award is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Awards, or benefits in lieu of an Award, even if Awards have been granted repeatedly in the past;  
  (3)  all decisions with respect to future Award grants, if any, will be at the discretion of the Committee, including, but not limited to, the timing of any grants, the number of units or Shares in any Award, and vesting provisions;
