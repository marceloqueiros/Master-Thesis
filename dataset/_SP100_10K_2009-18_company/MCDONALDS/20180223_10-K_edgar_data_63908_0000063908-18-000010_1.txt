Reconciliation of Returns on Incremental Invested Capital 

ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. 
  The denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter   2017   investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter   2017   investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter   2016   is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on   2017   operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter   2016   investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter, resulting in a weighted-average that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented. Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. 
  The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: 

(1) 
    Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured. 
              (2) 
    Represents one-year and three-year, respectively, weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash (provided by) used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year and four-year periods ended   December 31, 2017  . 

(3) 
    Significant investing cash inflows resulting from the Company's strategic refranchising initiatives and the gain from the sale of businesses in China and Hong Kong benefited the one-year and three-year ROIIC calculation by 1623.5% and 49.5%, respectively.  Excluding these items, one-year and three-year ROIIC were 48.3% and 43.6%, respectively.
