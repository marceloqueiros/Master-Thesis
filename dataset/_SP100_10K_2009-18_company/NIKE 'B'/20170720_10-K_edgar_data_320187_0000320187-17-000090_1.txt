  ITEM 1. Business 
   
               General 

NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms  we,   us,   NIKE,  and the  Company  refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our NIKE digital commerce website is located at   www.nike.com.   On our NIKE corporate website, located at   investors.nike.com,   we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ): our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our definitive Proxy Statements are also posted on our corporate website. All such filings on our corporate website are available free of charge. Copies of these filings may also be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549, or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 and are available on the SEC's website (  www.sec.gov  ). Also available on our corporate website are the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. 
  Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores, internet websites, and mobile applications (which we refer to collectively as our  Direct to Consumer  or  DTC  operations), and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad. 
   
               Products 

We focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in nine key categories: Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Men s Training, Women s Training, Action Sports, Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products) and Golf. Men's Training includes our baseball and American football product offerings. We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as cricket, lacrosse, tennis, volleyball, wrestling, walking and outdoor activities. 
  NIKE s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales. 
  We also sell sports apparel covering the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Men s Training and Running are currently our top-selling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in  collections  of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos. 
  We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation. 
  Our Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. 
  One of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley products are included within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment with sales reported within the Action Sports category. 
  Another of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. 
  In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our DTC operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.

Sales and Marketing 

Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in   Note 17   Operating Segments and Related Information   of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors. 
  Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
  We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. For fiscal 2017, our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central   Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets.   In June 2017, we announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizational realignment, beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand will be: North America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific and Latin America.   Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are, and will continue to be, managed within each geographic operating segment. 
  Converse is, and will continue to be, a reportable segment and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse Direct to Consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results. 
   
               United States Market 

For   fiscal 2017  , NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately   46%   of total revenues, compared to   47%   and   46%   for   fiscal 2016   and   fiscal 2015  , respectively. We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During   fiscal 2017  , our three largest customers accounted for approximately   23%   of sales in the United States. 
  Our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to consumers through our digital commerce website,   www.nike.com   and through mobile applications. In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell through the following number of retail stores in the United States:

      TOTAL 
    384 

In the United States, NIKE has six significant distribution centers located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and four of which are leased. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our leased Foothill Ranch, California distribution center. Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from leased facilities in Ontario, California, as well as from Memphis, Tennessee. Smaller leased distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States. 
  We also operate a futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price. For   fiscal 2017  , orders under the futures program represented   83%   of our U.S. wholesale footwear revenues, compared to   84%   for   fiscal 2016   and   87%   for   fiscal 2015  . For   fiscal 2017  , futures orders represented   66%   of our U.S. wholesale apparel revenues, compared to   66%   for   fiscal 2016   and   67%   for   fiscal 2015  . 
   
               International Markets 

For   fiscal 2017  , non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for   54%   of total revenues, compared to   53%   and   54%   for   fiscal 2016   and   fiscal 2015  , respectively. We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own Direct to Consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and ship products from   60   distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, Europe and some Latin American countries, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures ordering program described above. During   fiscal 2017  , NIKE s three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately   12%   of total non-U.S. sales.

               Significant Customer 

No   customer accounted for   10%   or more of our worldwide net revenues during   fiscal 2017  . 
   
               Orders 

Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2017 were $14.7 billion compared to $15.0 billion for the same period last year. NIKE Brand futures orders include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. The U.S. Dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the actual currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period and have become less correlated due to our evolving business model. This is due to year-over-year   changes in shipment timing, changes in   the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times, and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. A portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales with short lead times, closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley. 
   
               Product Research, Design and Development 

We believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste. 
  In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. 
  As we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences. The proliferation of NIKE Air, Lunar, Zoom, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, Flyweave, ZoomX, React and NIKE+ technologies throughout our Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Men's Training, Women's Training and Sportswear categories, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products. 
   
               Manufacturing 

We are supplied by approximately   127   footwear factories located in   15   countries. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately   8%   of total   fiscal 2017   NIKE Brand footwear production. Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories. For   fiscal 2017  , contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 46%, 27% and 21% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in Argentina, India, Brazil, Mexico and Italy to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. For   fiscal 2017  ,   five   footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately   69%   of NIKE Brand footwear production. 
  We are supplied by approximately   363   apparel factories located in   37   countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately   13%   of total   fiscal 2017   NIKE Brand apparel production. Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. For   fiscal 2017  , contract factories in China, Vietnam and Thailand produced approximately 26%, 16% and 10% of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. For   fiscal 2017  ,   one   apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately   43%   of NIKE Brand apparel production.

The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During   fiscal 2017  , Air Manufacturing Innovation, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. NIKE s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE's independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products. 
  Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America ( Sojitz America ), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During   fiscal 2017  , Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 6% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2018 and contain a provision allowing us to extend the agreements to May 31, 2019.

Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future. 
  In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. 
  We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. Current   U.S. policy proposals, including potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods, if enacted, may negatively affect U.S. corporations with production activities outside the U.S., including NIKE. There have also been discussions and commentary regarding potential changes to U.S. trade policies. If any of these reforms are implemented, it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition  , with respect to trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers China's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community. 
  Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability. 
  NIKE advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. 
   
               Competition 

The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. 
  NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are: 
             
    Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development and consumer price/value. 
                
    Consumer connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics.  
                
    Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and online. 
     We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.

Trademarks and Patents 

We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success, and our competitive position. We pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement. 
  We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations. 
  We have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. In some instances, we also obtain registered copyrights. 
  We own patents and have a patent license, facilitating our use of  Air  technologies.  
  We file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility patents, as well as many U.S. and foreign design patents protecting components, technologies, manufacturing techniques, features and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, athletic equipment and digital devices. These patents expire at various times. 
  We believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positions.  
  However, we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the United States and select foreign countries on inventions, designs and improvements that we deem valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against third-party infringement. 
   
               Employees 

As of   May 31, 2017  , we had approximately   74,400   employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports 
  Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE s business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain the words  believe,   anticipate,   expect,   estimate,   project,   will be,   will continue,   will likely result  or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKE s increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, the changing mix of futures and orders with shorter lead times, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE s products; increases in the cost of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in NIKE s debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability and terrorism; proposed changes to U.S. tax laws or policy, tariff and import/export regulations; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change and natural disasters; litigation, regulatory proceedings and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the effects of NIKE s decision to invest in or divest of businesses and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports. 
  The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE s business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKE s business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. 
  Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE s policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. 
  Our products face intense competition. 
  NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products. Our DTC operations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers selling our products. 
  Product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service, digital commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers are shopping, and the rising trend of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our DTC and wholesale operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. 
  Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business. 
  Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity. In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. 
  In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. Negative posts or comments about us on social networking applications or websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image. If we do not maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits. 
  Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products. 
  Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. 
  Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. 
  We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers.   However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed. 
  Furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or endorsers, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, or public figures, to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures, and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability. 
  Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. 
  A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. As a result, we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom's impending exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as  Brexit  and current U.S. policy proposals. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
  We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.

Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
  The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition: 
             
    Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins. 
                
    In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. 
                
    We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies, including in response to certain policies advocated by the U.S. presidential administration, could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition. 
                
    Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability. 
                
    If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense. 
                
    If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers. 
                
    If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. 
     Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results. 
  We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such as the Olympics or the European Football Championship, among others. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. 
  Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues. 
  We utilize a futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We currently report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports. Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for any future period, and the relationship between reported futures and reported revenues in a given period has become less correlated over time based on our evolving business model. Differences are also due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales with short lead times, closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our Direct to Consumer in-line stores and digital commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley. 
  Our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business. 
  We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. 
  The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.

We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers. 
  We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. 
  Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products. 
  The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional retail, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. 
  Our Direct to Consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. 
  Our Direct to Consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our Direct to Consumer operations, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs. 
  Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company s control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business.  
  If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. 
  Many of our customers shop with us through our digital commerce website and mobile applications. Increasingly, customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
  Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. 
  Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. 
  We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products. 
  The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights.  
  We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importation and/or sale of certain products. 
  We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. Such actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties, and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective. For example, confidential information that is related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions.

In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. 
  We are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.  
  We currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.  
  We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on   that brand and on us. 
  We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation. 
  In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we collect transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network, or vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers , users' or employees  personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, including, unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation and result in lost sales and consumers, fines, or lawsuits. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach. 
  In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data. Compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits. 
  Failure of our contractors or our licensees  contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harm our business. 
  We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. 
  Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. 
  Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union, as well as the current proposals affecting trade policy in the U.S. The U.S. presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through potential tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S. If any of these reforms are implemented, it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations. The administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain U.S. multinational corporations in public statements which, if directed at us, could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business. 
  In addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or additional tax liabilities. 
  We are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the United States, subject to significant change. There have been proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted.  
  Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time. These tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, our effective income tax rate would increase in the future. 
  We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. 
  Proposed changes to U.S. tax law or policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  During, and following, the recent U.S. presidential election, there has been discussion and commentary regarding potential significant changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including NAFTA and trade policies and tariffs affecting China. There have also been discussions of a disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products. It is unknown at this time whether and to what extent new legislation will be passed into law, pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted, international trade agreements will be negotiated, or the effect that any such action would have, either positively or negatively, on our industry, or on us. The Company, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by these changes. If any new legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated, it may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes. Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. 
  As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
  We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products. 
  NIKE is supplied by approximately   127   footwear factories located in   15   countries. We do not own or operate any of our own footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal   2017  ,   five   footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal   2017   footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately   69%   of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal   2017  . Our ability to meet our customers' needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
  Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing. 
  The principal materials used in our apparel products   natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware   are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products   natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films   are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured.

     Table of Contents  

There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long-term. 
  Because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. Current U.S. trade policy proposals, including potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2017, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Thailand (collectively the  Sojitz Markets ), excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the Sojitz Markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. 
  Our success depends on our global distribution facilities. 
  We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. 
  We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. 
  We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services ( Information Technology Systems ), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, or failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. 
  We also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users.

The market for prime real estate is competitive. 
  Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
  Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
  Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. 
  Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. 
  Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. 
  From time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our digital commerce operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. However, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. 
  We are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  As a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties, or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation. The global nature of our business means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, which could adversely affect us. In addition, any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert management s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. 
  We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business. 
  Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. 
  The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock. 
  As of June 30, 2017, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned more than 78% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2017, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. On June 30, 2016, Mr. Knight sold his voting interest in Swoosh, LLC to a trust controlled by his son and NIKE director, Travis Knight. 
  Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options. 
  Our long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard   Poor s and Moody s Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.

If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
  Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.  
  If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with   accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets, hedge accounting for derivatives, stock-based compensation, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock. 
  Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock. 
  There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company. 
  We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. 
  Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts  estimates of our future performance. Analysts  estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile for any reason, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in reputational damage, substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.

  ITEM 2. Properties 
  The following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased by NIKE: 
  The NIKE World Campus, owned by NIKE and located near Beaverton, Oregon, USA, is a 400-acre site consisting of over 40 buildings which, together with adjacent leased properties, functions as our world headquarters and is occupied by approximately 10,800 employees engaged in management, research, design, development, marketing, finance and other administrative functions serving nearly all of our divisions. We also lease various office facilities in the surrounding metropolitan area. We lease a similar, but smaller, administrative facility in Hilversum, the Netherlands, which serves as the headquarters for the Western Europe and Central   Eastern Europe geographies and management of certain brand functions for our non-U.S. operations. We also lease an office complex in Shanghai, China, our headquarters for Greater China, occupied by employees focused on implementing our wholesale, DTC and merchandising strategies in the region, among other functions. In the United States, NIKE has six significant distribution centers located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and four are leased. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center, which we lease. Smaller leased distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States. We also own or lease distribution and customer service facilities outside the United States. The most significant are the distribution facilities located in Laakdal, Belgium; Taicang, China; Tomisato, Japan and Incheon, Korea, all of which we own. 
  Air Manufacturing Innovation manufactures Air-Sole cushioning components at NIKE-owned facilities and one leased facility located near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri. Air Manufacturing Innovation also manufactures and sells small amounts of various other plastic products to other manufacturers. 
  Aside from the principal properties described above, we lease many offices worldwide for sales and administrative purposes. We lease approximately   1,141   retail stores worldwide, which consist primarily of factory outlet stores. See  United States Market  and  International Markets  in Part I of this Report. Our leases expire at various dates through the year 2033.

ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites and mobile applications (which we refer to collectively as our  Direct to Consumer  or  DTC  operations), and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative,  must have  products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail, online and through mobile applications. 
  In June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. Leveraging the power of digital, NIKE will drive growth   by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities, and deepening one-to-one connections. 
  In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: 
             
    Expanding gross margin by: 
     -   Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced price-to-value equation for consumers; 
  -   Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation; 
  -   Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market; and 
  -   Driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC business, led by digital commerce, as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our DTC and wholesale operations. 
             
    Optimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on: 
     -   Investments in consumer engagement   that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit; 
  -   Infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations; and 
  -   Investments in key areas of future growth, including our DTC business. 
             
    Managing working capital efficiency; and 
                
    Deploying capital effectively. 
     Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2020, on average per year, are as follows: 
             
    High single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth; 
                
    Mid-teens earnings per share growth; 
                
    High-twenties to low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital;  
                
    Free cash flow growing faster than net income; and 
                
    Sustainable, profitable, long-term growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. 
     Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of our financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 8% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. We expanded gross margin by approximately 70 basis points, and our return on invested capital has increased from 21.9% to 34.7%. 
  On November 19, 2015, we announced a   two  -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a   100   percent stock dividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. 
  Our fiscal 2017 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver continued growth and expanding profitability. Despite foreign currency headwinds, we achieved record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2017. NIKE, Inc.   Revenues   grew 6% to $34.4 billion,   Net income   increased 13% and diluted earnings per common share grew 16% to $2.51. We also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for long-term growth. 
  Earnings before interest and income taxes ( EBIT ) increased 7% for fiscal 2017, driven by revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage, partially offset by gross margin contraction. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across all NIKE Brand geographies and Converse, footwear and apparel, and several key categories. This broad-based growth was primarily fueled by: 
             
    Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Free, Zoom, Lunar, Flywire, Dri-Fit and Flyknit;  
                
    Deep brand connections with consumers through our category offense, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes, sports teams and leagues, high-impact marketing around global sporting events and digital marketing; and 
                
    Strong category retail presentation through digital commerce and NIKE-owned and retail partner stores.  
     NIKE, Inc. gross margin decreased 160 basis points primarily due to higher product costs and foreign currency exchange rate headwinds, which more than offset higher full-price average selling price (ASP). At current rates, we anticipate foreign currency exchange rate headwinds will continue to negatively impact gross margin and   Net income   in fiscal 2018. 
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

Converse revenues increased 4% and EBIT declined 2%, as growth in direct distribution markets and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by lower gross margin, primarily a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs, as well as the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues primarily due to market transitions. 
  For fiscal 2017, the growth in   Net income   was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate of 550 basis points primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States. Diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than   Net income   due to a 3% decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program. 
  While foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above. 
  Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no Direct to Consumer operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations, which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  
  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company     s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

     Fiscal 2017   Compared to   Fiscal 2016 
  On a constant-currency basis, NIKE, Inc.   Revenues   grew 8% for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by higher revenues for the NIKE Brand and Converse. All NIKE Brand geographies delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2017 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving demand for NIKE Brand products. Revenue growth was broad-based as Greater China, Western Europe, Emerging Markets and North America each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc.   Revenues  . 
  On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 8% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2017, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 3%. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by strong growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2017 increased 7%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 1 percentage point of footwear revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price and off-price ASPs, partially offset by the impact of higher off-price sales.  
  The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was fueled by growth in several key categories, most notably Sportswear, Men s Training and Running. Unit sales of apparel increased 6%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and, to a lesser extent, growth in our higher-priced DTC business. 
  While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. Our NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as NIKE-owned digital commerce. For fiscal 2017, DTC revenues represented approximately 28% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 26% for fiscal 2016. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2017, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 30%, the addition of new stores and 7% comparable store sales growth. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. On a reported basis, digital commerce sales through NIKE-owned websites and mobile applications, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017 compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2016 and represented approximately 24% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2017 compared to 22% for fiscal 2016. 
  On a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand Men s revenues increased 6%, driven by significant growth in Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, while Women's revenues increased 8%, led by growth in Sportswear and Running. Revenues for our Young Athletes' business increased 8%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand. 
  Fiscal 2016   Compared to   Fiscal 2015    
  On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc.   Revenues   grew 12% for fiscal 2016, primarily driven by higher revenues for the NIKE Brand. Every NIKE Brand geography grew revenues for fiscal 2016. North America contributed approximately 4 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc.   Revenues  , while Greater China and Western Europe each contributed approximately 3 percentage points, Emerging Markets contributed approximately 2 percentage points and Central   Eastern Europe contributed approximately 1 percentage point.  
  On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 15% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 2%. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, including strong growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 9%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher full-price ASP, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business.  
  The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Men s Training, Running, Women s Training and Football (Soccer). Apparel unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in our higher-priced DTC business. 
  For fiscal 2016, DTC revenues represented approximately 26% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 23% in fiscal 2015. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 25% for fiscal 2016, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 10%. Digital commerce sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 51% in fiscal 2016. Digital commerce sales grew 59% in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, digital commerce sales represented approximately 22% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues compared to 18% for fiscal 2015. 
  On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, fiscal 2016 NIKE Brand Men s revenues increased 11%, driven by growth in Sportswear and the Jordan Brand, while Women s revenues increased 17%, led by Sportswear, Running and Women s Training. Revenues for our Young Athletes  business increased 11%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand.

Futures Orders 
  Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2017 totaled $  14.7 billion  ,   2%   lower than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. NIKE Brand futures orders include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. The U.S. Dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period.  
  By geography, futures orders were as follows:  

(1) 
    Futures orders have been calculated using prior year exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
     Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period and have become less correlated due to our evolving business model. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times, and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. A portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales with short lead times, closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley. 
  Gross Margin 

Fiscal 2017   Compared to   Fiscal 2016 
  For fiscal 2017, our consolidated gross margin was 160 basis points lower than fiscal 2016, primarily driven by the following factors: 
             
    Higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, (increasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premium products to the consumer; 
                
    Higher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 100 basis points) as an increase in the mix of higher cost products and labor input cost inflation more than offset lower material input costs; 
                
    Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 90 basis points); and 
                
    Lower NIKE Brand DTC margins (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points) reflecting the impact of higher off-price sales. 
     Fiscal 2016   Compared to   Fiscal 2015    
  For fiscal 2016, our consolidated gross margin was 20 basis points higher than fiscal 2015, primarily attributable to the following factors: 
             
    Higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, (increasing gross margin approximately 190 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premium products with higher prices and, to a lesser extent, due to price increases reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories; 
                
    Growth in our higher-margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points); 
                
    Higher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) as shifts in mix to higher-cost products and labor input cost inflation were only partially offset by lower material input costs; 
                
    Higher off-price mix (decreasing gross margin approximately 30 basis points), primarily reflecting the impacts from clearing excess inventory in North America; 
                
    Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points);  
                
    Higher other costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primarily due to higher product design and development costs; and 
                
    Lower gross margin from Converse (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primarily resulting from shifts in mix to lower-margin products.

Total Selling and Administrative Expense 

(1) 
    Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events and retail brand presentation. 
     Fiscal 2017   Compared to   Fiscal 2016 
  Demand creation expense   increased 2% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, driven by higher sports marketing costs, as well as higher marketing and advertising costs, primarily to support key sporting events including the Rio Olympics and European Football Championship. These increases were partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced   Demand creation expense   by approximately 1 percentage point. 
  Operating overhead expense   was flat compared to fiscal 2016 as continued investments in our growing DTC business were offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced   Operating overhead expense   by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2017. 
  Fiscal 2016   Compared to   Fiscal 2015    
  Demand creation expense   increased 2% for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to investments in digital brand marketing, including for our DTC business, as well as support for key brand events and initiatives, and sports marketing investments, partially offset by lower advertising expense. For fiscal 2016, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in   Demand creation expense   by approximately 6 percentage points. 
  Operating overhead expense   increased 8% compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of continued investments in our DTC business, including new store openings and higher variable expenses, as well as higher wage-related expenses and investments in consumer-focused digital capabilities, partially offset by lower variable compensation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in   Operating overhead expense   by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2016. 
  Other (Income) Expense, Net 

Other (income) expense, net   comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business. 
  Fiscal 2017   Compared to   Fiscal 2016    
  Other (income) expense, net   increased from $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016 to $196 million of other income, net for fiscal 2017, primarily due to a $56 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses.  
  We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in   Other (income) expense, net   had an unfavorable impact on our   Income before income taxes   of $59 million for fiscal 2017.  
  Fiscal 2016   Compared to   Fiscal 2015    
  Other (income) expense, net   increased from $58 million of other income, net for fiscal 2015 to $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016, driven by a $26 million net change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, a favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case in Western Europe and net gains from other non-operating items.  
  We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in   Other (income) expense, net   had an unfavorable impact on our   Income before income taxes   of $423 million for fiscal 2016. 
  Income Taxes 

Fiscal 2017   Compared to   Fiscal 2016    
  The 550 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States. 
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

Fiscal 2016   Compared to   Fiscal 2015    
  The 350 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside the United States, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate.  
   
               Operating Segments 

Our operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.  
  Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central   Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company s NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. 
  As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established.   Inventories   and   Cost of sales   for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. 
  The breakdown of revenues is as follows: 

(1)   
    Results have been restated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.

North America 

Fiscal 2017   Compared to   Fiscal 2016 
  North America revenues increased 3%, driven by growth in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories, including NIKE Basketball. DTC revenues increased 9% for fiscal 2017 due to digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 3%. The broader retail marketplace in North America is being impacted by several significant trends, including shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels, retail consolidation and a promotional environment. 
  Footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories. Unit sales of footwear increased 4%, while ASP per pair was flat as higher off-price ASP was offset by unfavorable off-price mix. 
  The increase in apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was due to growth concentrated in Sportswear, partially offset by declines in several other categories. Unit sales of apparel grew 2% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP. 
  EBIT grew 3% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin increased 10 basis points as higher full-price ASP and favorable off-price margin more than offset higher product costs and increased off-price mix as a result of clearing excess inventories through off-price channels, including through our DTC business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead as continued investments in our growing DTC business were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Demand creation was flat as higher sports marketing and retail brand presentation costs offset lower marketing and advertising costs. 
  Fiscal 2016   Compared to   Fiscal 2015    
  On a constant-currency basis, North America revenues increased 8% primarily due to growth in our Sportswear, Jordan Brand and Running categories. DTC revenues grew 17% for fiscal 2016, fueled by strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 6%.

Currency-neutral footwear revenue growth was attributable to higher revenues in most key categories, led by the Jordan Brand, Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, partially offset by a slight decline in NIKE Basketball. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of footwear increased 8%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, partially offset by higher off-price mix. 
  Apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by our Sportswear and Men's Training categories. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of apparel grew 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP.  
  EBIT increased 3% for fiscal 2016 as higher revenues were largely offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin declined 80 basis points as higher off-price mix, higher warehousing and inventory obsolescence costs, as well as higher product input costs more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead to support our growing DTC operations and bad debt expense related to customer bankruptcies was partially offset by lower variable compensation. Demand creation also grew at a faster rate than revenues due to higher spending for sports marketing, DTC marketing and key brand events and initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising expense. 
  Western Europe 

Fiscal 2017   Compared to   Fiscal 2016    
  On a currency-neutral basis, Western Europe revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 11%. Revenue growth was broad-based across all territories, led by Western Europe s largest territory, the UK   Ireland, which grew 11%. On a category basis, revenues increased for nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand. DTC revenues grew 28% for fiscal 2017 due to strong digital commerce sales growth, comparable store sales growth of 16% and the addition of new stores. 
  The constant-currency increase in footwear revenues was led by Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, partially offset by declines concentrated in Football (Soccer). For fiscal 2017, unit sales of footwear increased 5% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our DTC business. 
  Currency-neutral apparel revenue growth was due to higher revenues for nearly every key category, most notably Sportswear and, to a lesser extent, Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel for fiscal 2017 increased 16%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of growth in our DTC business and higher full-price ASP. 
  Reported EBIT decreased 16% for fiscal 2017, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by significant gross margin contraction.   Gross margin declined 550 basis points primarily driven by the effects of significant unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates.   Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation expense, as increased sports marketing and advertising expenses more than offset lower marketing costs. Operating overhead also increased due to continued investments in our growing DTC business, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation costs.

On a reported basis, EBIT grew 12% for fiscal 2016, despite the negative translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the Euro. EBIT grew at a higher rate than revenue as selling and administrative expense leverage and the favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case reflected in   Other (income) expense, net  , were only partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 10 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher off-price mix were mostly offset by higher full-price ASP, shifts in mix to lower-cost products and growth in our higher-margin DTC business. Selling and administrative expense was lower as a percent of revenues despite higher operating overhead, primarily to support DTC expansion. Demand creation increased slightly as higher spending for DTC and other demand creation costs more than offset lower sports marketing costs.

Converse 

In territories we define as  direct distribution markets  Converse designs, markets and sells products directly to distributors and wholesale customers, and to consumers through DTC operations. The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. 
  Fiscal 2017   Compared to   Fiscal 2016 
  On a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse increased 6% for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e. markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) grew 4%, contributing approximately 4 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the increase in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the United States, partially offset by lower revenues in Europe. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total Converse revenues by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by the market transition in Italy. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 5%, having an insignificant impact to total Converse revenue. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues is primarily due to lower revenues in Latin America. 
  Reported EBIT declined 2% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased 300 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin products. Gross margin also contracted due to the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues, primarily due to market transitions. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense, primarily as a result of lower retail brand presentation costs, partially offset by higher advertising expense. Operating overhead increased as higher wage-related expenses were only partially offset by lower administrative costs. 
  Fiscal 2016   Compared to   Fiscal 2015    
  Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Converse revenues increased 2% for fiscal 2016. Comparable direct distribution markets  grew 4%, contributing approximately 3 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of direct distribution market revenue growth. On a territory basis, growth in the United States and Asia Pacific was partially offset by declines in Europe, primarily the United Kingdom. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution markets had an insignificant impact on total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 15% for fiscal 2016, reducing total Converse revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues was primarily due to poor macroeconomic conditions in Latin America. 
  Reported EBIT for Converse decreased 6% for fiscal 2016 as a decrease in reported revenues and lower gross margin more than offset selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin declined 220 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, shifts in mix to higher-cost products and higher off-price mix more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense declined faster than reported revenues primarily due to lower demand creation, which more than offset slightly higher operating overhead due to higher wage-related expenses. 
  Corporate 

Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program. 
  The Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses. 
  In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments.

    a beneficial change of $280 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; 
                
    a beneficial change of $115 million, primarily driven by lower variable compensation and administrative costs in operating overhead expense; and 
                
    an increase in net foreign currency gains of $54 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated   Other (income) expense, net. 
     Fiscal 2016   Compared to   Fiscal 2015    
  For fiscal 2016, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $76 million primarily due to the following: 
             
    an increase of $179 million, primarily driven by higher operating overhead expense to support corporate growth initiatives; 
                
    a beneficial change of $76 million from net foreign currency losses to net foreign currency gains related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these gains are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; and 
                
    a beneficial change of $27 million in net foreign currency gains related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated   Other (income) expense, net. 
      
               Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices 

Overview 
  As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. 
  Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company ( NTC ) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
  Transactional Exposures 
  We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: 
             
    Product Costs   NIKE s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: 
              1. 
    Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: 
              a. 
    Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. 
              b. 
    Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. 
     In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.

2. 
    Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories  foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ( factory currency exposure index ) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ( factory input costs ) are denominated. 
     For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within   Inventories   and is recognized in   Cost of sales   when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through   Other (income) expense, net  . Refer to   Note 16   Risk Management and Derivatives   in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. 
  As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthe  ning U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. 
             
    Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales   A portion of our Western Europe and Central   Eastern Europe geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. 
                
    Other Costs   Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to foreign currencies and create embedded derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value through     Other (income) expense, net  .   Refer to   Note 16   Risk Management and Derivatives   in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. 
                
    Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities   Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in   Other (income) expense, net   within our consolidated results of operations. 
     Managing Transactional Exposures 
  Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above. 
  Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in   Other (income) expense, net   and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged.  
  Refer to   Note 6   Fair Value Measurements   and   Note 16   Risk Management and Derivatives   in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. 
  Translational Exposures 
  Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries  non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to   Accumulated other comprehensive income   within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders  Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated   Revenues   was a detriment of approximately $542 million and $1,985 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our   Income before income taxes   was a detriment of approximately $115 million and $449 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
  Managing Translational Exposures 
  To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

  We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in   Other (income) expense, net   had an unfavorable impact of approximately $59 million and $423 million on our   Income before income taxes   for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
  Net Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries 
  We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2017 and 2016. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016. 
   
               Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow Activity 
  Cash provided by operations   was   $3,640 million   for   fiscal 2017   compared to   $3,096 million   for   fiscal 2016  . Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated   $4,781 million   of operating cash flow in   fiscal 2017   compared to   $4,676 million   for   fiscal 2016  . Our   fiscal 2017   change in working capital was a cash   outflow   of   $1,141 million   compared to an   outflow   of   $1,580 million   for   fiscal 2016  . The change in working capital was primarily due to the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging activities. For fiscal 2017, cash collateral received from counterparties, which is recorded in   Accrued liabilities   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, decreased $105 million compared to a decrease of $863 million during fiscal 2016. Refer to the Credit Risk section of   Note 16   Risk Management and Derivatives   in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.   This decrease in cash collateral was partially offset by a $486 million increase in   Accounts Receivable, net   driven by higher revenues. 
  Cash used by investing activities   was   $1,008 million   for   fiscal 2017   compared to   $1,034 million   for   fiscal 2016  , driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments and reverse repurchase agreements, as well as additions of property, plant and equipment. During   fiscal 2017  , the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of   $118 million   compared to an outflow of   $57 million   in   fiscal 2016  . This change was partially offset by the maturity of reverse repurchase agreements of   $150 million   in   fiscal 2016   which did not recur in   fiscal 2017  . Additions of property, plant and equipment were   $1,105 million   in fiscal 2017 compared to   $1,143 million   in   fiscal 2016  . 
  In fiscal 2018, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, new DTC stores, and expanding our digital capabilities. We continue to expect such investments will be approximately 4% of revenues, on average. 
  Cash used by financing activities   was   $1,942 million   for   fiscal 2017   compared to   $2,671 million   for   fiscal 2016  . The decrease in   Cash used by financing activities   was primarily driven by increased proceeds from the issuance of debt and commercial paper in fiscal 2017, partially offset by higher dividends and lower excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. 
  In   fiscal 2017  , we purchased   59.7 million   shares of NIKE s Class B Common Stock for   $3,249 million   (an average price of $  54.43   per share) under the four-year, $12 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of May 31, 2017, we had repurchased   79.8 million   shares at a cost of approximately   $4,437 million   (an average price of   $55.63   per share) under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. 
  Capital Resources 
  On October 21, 2016, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2026 and 2046. The 2026 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion at a 2.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2026. The 2046 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2046. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of $1,493 million. Refer to   Note 8   Long-Term Debt   in the accompanying Notes   to the Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional detail on   Long-term debt  . 
  On August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and for the periods ended   May 31, 2017   and   2016  , we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility. 
  We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of   May 31, 2017  , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.

     Table of Contents  

Liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended   May 31, 2017  , the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $919 million. As of   May 31, 2017  , there were $325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2018 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. 
  As of   May 31, 2017  , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling   $6.2 billion  , of which   $5.8 billion   was held by our foreign subsidiaries.   Cash equivalents   and   Short-term investments   consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of   May 31, 2017  , the average duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was   65   days. 
  To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. 
  We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of   May 31, 2017   and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows: 

(1) 
    Capital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements.  
              (2) 
    The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of   May 31, 2017   (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations. 
              (3) 
    The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. 
     In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. 
           (4) 
    We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. 
              (5) 
    Other purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases.

In addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to   Note 9   Income Taxes   and   Note 13   Benefit Plans   in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively.  
  We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of   May 31, 2017  .

               New Accounting Pronouncements 

Refer to   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards.  
   
               Critical Accounting Policies 

Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. 
  Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. 
  In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. 
  In certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. 
  As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination. 
  Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable 
  We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to   Operating overhead expense   in the period in which such a determination is made. 
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

Inventory Reserves 
  We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to   Cost of sales  . If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to   Cost of sales  .  
  Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts 
  A significant portion of our   Demand creation expense   relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. 
  Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. 
  Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are recorded in   Demand creation expense   ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s performance, increased or decreased   Demand creation expense   may be recorded in a future period. 
  Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in   Cost of sales   as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in   Demand creation expense   uniformly over the contract term. 
  Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets 
  We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group s carrying amount and its estimated fair value. 
  Hedge Accounting for Derivatives 
  We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in   Other comprehensive income  , rather than   Net income  , until the underlying hedged transaction affects   Net income  . In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from   Other comprehensive income   into   Net income   sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from   Other comprehensive income   to   Other (income) expense, net   during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. 
  Stock-based Compensation 
  We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. 
  Income Taxes 
  We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our   Income tax expense   in the period when such determination is made. 
  In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducing our overall   Income tax expense  . The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. 
  
   40

We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional   Income tax expense   in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our   Income tax expense   would be reduced in the year of such determination. 
  On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date   Income before income taxes   excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date   Income tax expense  . The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. 
  On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in   Income tax expense  . 
  Other Contingencies 
  In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes. 
  We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to   12   to   24   months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to   100%   of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of   May 31, 2017   are designated   as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs.   Refer to   Note 16   Risk Management and Derivatives   in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. 
  Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities. 
               Market Risk Measurement 

We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk ( VaR ). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. 
  We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a  variance/co-variance  technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the  delta  and  gamma ) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. 
  The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. 
  The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $97 million and $109 million at May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The VAR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2017. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $161 million and $209 million during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. 
  The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. 
  Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

The fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries. Accordingly, the monthly translation of these instruments, which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recognized in   Accumulated other comprehensive income   upon consolidation of this subsidiary.

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) - 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  While  reasonable assurance  is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of   May 31, 2017  . 
  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the Consolidated Financial Statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of   May 31, 2017  , as stated in their report herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NIKE, Inc.: 
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of   May 31, 2017   and   2016  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   May 31, 2017   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   May 31, 2017  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework     (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse.   The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across a wide range of sport categories, amplified with sport-inspired sportswear products carrying the Swoosh trademark as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks.   The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. The Hurley brand is focused on surf and action sports and youth lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories, using the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results of Hurley brand products are reported within the NIKE Brand s North America geographic operating segment. Converse designs, distributes, markets and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. 
  Basis of Consolidation 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
  On November 19, 2015, the Company announced a   two  -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a   100   percent stock dividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to   fiscal 2017   presentation. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Wholesale revenues are recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. Post-invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. Estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated discounts, returns and claims expected, but not yet finalized with customers. As of   May 31, 2017   and   2016  , the Company s reserve balances for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were   $643 million   and   $789 million  , respectively. 
  Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales   consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and research, design and development costs. Outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in   Cost of sales  . 
  Demand Creation Expense 
  Demand creation expense   consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising communication costs are expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is completed and delivered. 
  A significant amount of the Company s promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. Accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in   Prepaid expenses and other current assets   or   Deferred income taxes and other assets   depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. 
  Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. 
  Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in   Demand creation expense   ratably over the contract period based on the Company s best estimate of the endorser s performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from the Company s estimate due to changes in the endorser s performance, increased or decreased demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. 
  Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments in   Cost of sales   as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which the Company estimates it will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in   Demand creation expense   uniformly over the contract period.

     Table of Contents  

Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses customers for certain costs of advertising the Company s products. The Company records these costs in   Demand creation expense   at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. 
  Total advertising and promotion expenses were   $3,341 million  ,   $3,278 million   and   $3,213 million   for the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled   $558 million   and   $540 million   at   May 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively, of which   $311 million   and   $272 million  , respectively, was recorded in   Prepaid expenses and other current assets  , and   $247 million     and     $268 million  , respectively, was recorded in   Deferred income taxes and other assets,   depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. 
  Operating Overhead Expense 
  Operating overhead expense   consists primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses as well as other administrative costs, such as rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services and meetings and travel. 
  Cash and Equivalents 
  Cash and equivalents   represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market funds, time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. 
  Short-Term Investments 
  Short-term investments   consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, time deposits and corporate debt securities, with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At   May 31, 2017   and   2016  , the Company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity. 
  At   May 31, 2017   and   2016  ,   Short-term investments   consisted of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in   Accumulated other comprehensive income  , unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within   Short-term investments   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Refer to   Note 6   Fair Value Measurements   for more information on the Company s short-term investments. 
  Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable 
  Accounts receivable, net   consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in   Deferred income taxes and other assets  . The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was   $19 million   and   $43 million   at   May 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively. 
  Inventory Valuation 
  Inventories   are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on either an average or specific identification cost basis. For inventories in transit that represent direct shipments to customers, the related inventory and cost of sales are recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees. 
  Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation 
  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over   2   to   40   years and for machinery and equipment over   2   to   15   years. 
  Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in   Cost of sales  . Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in   Operating overhead expense  . 
  Software Development Costs 
  Internal Use Software  : Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a   2   to   12   year period on a straight-line basis. The Company s policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. 
  Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed  : Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.

     Table of Contents  

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
  The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group s carrying amount and its estimated fair value. 
  Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
  The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. 
  Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the   C  ompany determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. 
  Operating Leases 
  The Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Certain leases also provide for contingent rent, which is generally determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable. 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). 
  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 
             
    Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
                
    Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
     The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
  Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of its counterparties.

     Table of Contents  

Level 1 investments include U.S. Treasury securities. Assets and liabilities included within Level 2 include commercial paper, U.S. Agency securities, money market funds, time deposits, corporate debt securities and derivative contracts. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs and are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. 
  The Company s fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. 
  Refer to   Note 6   Fair Value Measurements   for additional information. 
  Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions 
  Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of   Accumulated other comprehensive income   in   Total shareholders  equity  . 
  The Company s global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in   Other (income) expense, net  , within the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in   Accumulated other comprehensive income   (a component of   Total shareholders  equity  ),   Long-term debt   or   Net income   depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the   Cash provided by operations   component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is within the   Cash used by investing activities   component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the Company s fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the   Cash provided by operations   component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to   Note 16   Risk Management and Derivatives   for more information on the Company s risk management program and derivatives. 
  Stock-Based Compensation 
  The Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan and employees  purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as   Operating overhead expense   in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. 
  Refer to   Note 11   Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation   for more information on the Company s stock-based compensation programs. 
  Income Taxes 
  The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. 
  The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in   Income tax expense  . 
  Refer to   Note 9   Income Taxes   for further discussion. 
  Earnings Per Share 
  Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing   Net income   by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. 
  Refer to   Note 12   Earnings Per Share   for further discussion. 
  Management Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03,   Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The updated guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability on the balance sheet. The Company adopted the standard on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this standard reduced both   Deferred income taxes and other assets   and   Long-term debt   by     $17 million   on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   May 31, 2016  . 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  . The updated guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect recognized through retained earnings at the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which interim or annual financial statements have not been issued. The Company is evaluating the impact this update will have on its existing accounting policies and the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company anticipates the updated guidance could have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements at adoption through the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of previously deferred charges. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees. The updated guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies from share-based payment awards to be recorded in income tax expense in the income statement. Currently, excess tax benefits and deficiencies are recognized in shareholders  equity on the balance sheet. This change is required to be applied prospectively. In addition, the updated guidance also changes the accounting for statutory tax withholding requirements, classification in the statement of cash flows and provides an option to continue to estimate forfeitures or account for forfeitures as they occur. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2017 and will elect to continue to estimate forfeitures. The ASU is expected to result in increased volatility to the Company s income tax expense in future periods dependent upon, among other variables, the price of its common stock and the timing and volume of share-based payment award activity, such as employee exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , that replaces existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance will require the Company to continue to classify leases as either operating or financing, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2019. The ASU is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest period presented, with optional practical expedients. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its existing accounting policies and the Consolidated Financial Statements, but expects there will be an increase in assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at adoption due to the recording of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities, which may be material. Refer to   Note 15   Commitments and Contingencies   for information about the Company s lease obligations. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The update to the standard is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ,     that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effective of initially applying the new standard recognized in retained earnings at the date of initial application. The Company is in the process of evaluating the new standard against its existing accounting policies, including the timing of revenue recognition, and its contracts with customers, to determine the effect the guidance will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company elects to record the gross assets and liabilities of its derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company s derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early termination of the contract. Any amounts of cash collateral received related to these instruments associated with the Company's credit-related contingent features are recorded in   Cash and equivalents   and   Accrued liabilities  , the latter of which would further offset against the Company s derivative asset balance (refer to   Note 16   Risk Management and Derivatives  ). Any amounts of cash collateral posted related to these instruments associated with the Company's credit-related contingent features are recorded in   Prepaid expenses and other current assets  , which would further offset against the Company's derivative liability balance (refer to   Note 16   Risk Management and Derivatives  ). Cash collateral received or posted related to the Company's credit related contingent features is presented in the   Cash provided by operations   component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Any amounts of non-cash collateral received, such as securities, are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets pursuant to U.S. GAAP.

The provision for income taxes is as follows: 

A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows: 

The effective tax rate for the year ended   May 31, 2017   was   550   basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended   May 31, 2016   primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States. 
  The effective tax rate for the year ended   May 31, 2016   was   350   basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended   May 31, 2015   primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside of the United States, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise the following:    

The following is a reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits: 

As of   May 31, 2017  , total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were   $461 million  ,   $230 million   of which would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. 
  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in   Income tax expense  . The liability for payment of interest and penalties decreased by   $38 million   during the year ended   May 31, 2017  , increased by   $45 million   during the year ended   May 31, 2016   and decreased by   $3 million   during the year ended   May 31, 2015  . As of   May 31, 2017   and   2016  , accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were   $171 million   and   $209 million  , respectively (excluding federal benefit). 
  The Company is subject to taxation in the United States as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, the Company received statutory notices of deficiency from the IRS for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 proposing a total increase in tax of   $254 million  , subject to interest, related to a foreign tax credit matter. The Company contested these deficiencies by filing petitions with the U.S Tax Court. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company reached a resolution with the IRS on this matter. Decisions were subsequently filed in U.S. District Tax Court stating there is   no   deficiency in income tax due from the Company. In the current period, the Company closed all U.S. federal income tax matters for fiscal years 2013 and 2014, with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for fiscal years   2015 and 2016  .  
  The Company s major foreign jurisdictions, China and the Netherlands, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2006 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to   $69 million   within the next 12 months.

The Company provides for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At   May 31, 2017  , the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided were approximately   $12.2 billion  . If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings would be approximately   $4.1 billion   at   May 31, 2017  . 
  A portion of the Company's foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in   2021  . This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday was   $187 million  ,   $173 million   and   $174 million   for the fiscal years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was   $0.11  ,   $0.10   and   $0.10   for the fiscal years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Deferred tax assets at   May 31, 2017   and   2016   were reduced by a valuation allowance primarily relating to tax benefits of certain entities with operating losses. There was a   $30 million   net increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended   May 31, 2017  , compared to a net increase of   $43 million   for the year ended   May 31, 2016   and   no   net change for the year ended   May 31, 2015  .  
  The Company has recorded deferred tax assets of   $208 million   at   May 31, 2017   for foreign tax credit carry-forwards which expire in 2027. 
  The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of   $266 million   at   May 31, 2017  . Such losses will expire as follows:    

During the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , income tax benefits attributable to employee stock-based compensation transactions of   $177 million  ,   $281 million   and   $224 million  , respectively, were allocated to   Total shareholders  equity  .

Sojitz America is the sole owner of the Company s authorized redeemable preferred stock,   $1   par value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par value aggregating   $0.3 million  . A cumulative dividend of   $0.10   per share is payable annually on May 31 and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the redeemable preferred stock in the three years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  . As the holder of the redeemable preferred stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights, but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. The redeemable preferred stock has been fully issued to Sojitz America and is not blank check preferred stock. The Company's articles of incorporation do not permit the issuance of additional preferred stock. 
   
               NOTE 11   Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation 

The authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock,   no   par value, and Class B Common Stock,   no   par value, are   400 million   and   2,400 million  , respectively.   Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock.   Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock. 
  The NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the  Stock Incentive Plan ) provides for the issuance of up to   718 million   previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the Stock Incentive Plan are granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over   four   years and expire   ten   years from the date of grant. 
  The following table summarizes the Company s total stock-based compensation expense recognized in   Operating overhead expense  :    

(1) 
    Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. Accelerated stock option expense was   $14 million  ,   $30 million   and   $19 million   for the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
     As of   May 31, 2017  , the Company had   $201 million   of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized in   Operating overhead expense   over a weighted average remaining period of   1.9   years.

     Table of Contents  

The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , computed as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was   $9.38  ,   $12.66   and   $8.48  , respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows: 

The Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Company s common stock with a term greater than   one   year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options. 
  The following summarizes the stock option transactions under the plan discussed above:    

(1) 
    Includes stock appreciation rights transactions. 
     The weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at   May 31, 2017   was   5.7   years and   4.5   years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at   May 31, 2017   was   $2,027 million   and   $1,846 million  , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was   $594 million  ,   $946 million   and   $795 million  , respectively. 
  In addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Subject to the annual statutory limit, employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions of up to   10%   of their compensation. At the end of each   six  -month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at   85%   of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased   3.1 million  ,   2.5 million   and   2.7 million   shares during each of the three years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  From time to time, the Company grants restricted stock and restricted stock units to key employees under the Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares underlying such awards granted to employees during the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were   0.4 million  ,   1.0 million   and   0.5 million  , respectively, with weighted average values per share of   $57.59  ,   $54.87   and   $39.69  , respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The value of all grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , the aggregate fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested was   $60 million  ,   $49 million   and   $20 million  , respectively, determined as of the date of vesting. As of   May 31, 2017  , the Company had   $43 million   of unrecognized compensation costs from restricted stock and restricted stock units to be recognized in   Operating overhead expense   over a weighted average period of   2.4   years.

NOTE 12   Earnings Per Share 

The following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per common share to diluted earnings per common share. The computations of diluted earnings per common share excluded options, including shares under employee stock purchase plans, to purchase an additional   30.5 million  ,   0.2 million   and   1.7 million   shares of common stock outstanding for the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, because the options were anti-dilutive. 

The Company has a qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, in which all U.S. employees are able to participate. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions to the savings plan. Company contributions to the savings plan were   $75 million  ,   $72 million   and   $58 million   and included in   Operating overhead expense   for the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The terms of the plan also allow for annual discretionary profit sharing contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, to the accounts of eligible U.S. employees who work at least 1,000 hours in a year. Profit sharing contributions of   $68 million  ,   $64 million   and   $58 million   were made to the plan and included in   Operating overhead expense   for the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) that was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by shareholders in September 1997 and later amended and approved in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2012. The Company recognized   $21 million  ,   $85 million   and   $68 million   of   Operating overhead expense   related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Company allows certain highly compensated employees and non-employee directors of the Company to defer compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Deferred compensation plan liabilities were   $569 million   and   $475 million   at   May 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively, and primarily classified as long-term in   Deferred income taxes and other liabilities  . 
  The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was   $107 million   and   $93 million   at   May 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively, and primarily classified as long-term in   Deferred income taxes and other liabilities  . 
   
               NOTE 14   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 

The changes in   Accumulated other comprehensive income  , net of tax, were as follows: 

(1) 
    The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. 
              (2) 
    Net of tax benefit (expense) of $  0 million  , $  24 million  , $  0 million  , $  3 million   and $  27 million  , respectively.

     Table of Contents  

In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Company s historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
  In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
   
               NOTE 16   Risk Management and Derivatives 

The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
  The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. 
  The majority of derivatives outstanding as of   May 31, 2017   are designated   as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs  .   All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instrument s maturity date. 
  The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   May 31, 2017   and   2016  :

    All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. Refer to  Fair Value Hedges  in this note for additional detail. 
     Refer to   Note 6   Fair Value Measurements   for a description of how the above financial instruments are valued and   Note 14   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income   and the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders  Equity for additional information on changes in   Accumulated other comprehensive income   for the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  . 
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  The purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures that the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions. 
  Product cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities     purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company ( NTC ), a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. 
  The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories  foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Company s payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ( factory currency exposure index ) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ( factory input costs ) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory s acceptance of NIKE s purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below. 
  The Company s policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to   12   to   24   months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to   100%   of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs.   The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was   $11.1 billion   as of   May 31, 2017  . 
  During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company terminated all forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of   $1.5 billion   in connection with the October 21, 2016 debt issuance (refer to Note 8 - Long-Term Debt). Upon termination of these forward-starting swaps, the Company made cash payments to the related counterparties of   $92 million  , which was recorded in   Accumulated other comprehensive  
  
   68 

     Table of Contents  

income   and will be released through   Interest expense (income), net   as interest expense is incurred over the term of the issued debt. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company terminated certain forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of   $1 billion   in connection with the October 29, 2015 debt issuance (refer to   Note 8   Long-Term Debt  ). Upon termination of these forward-starting swaps, the Company received cash payments from the related counterparties of   $34 million  , which was recorded in   Accumulated other comprehensive income   and will be released through   Interest expense (income), net   as interest expense is incurred over the term of the issued debt. 
  All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in   Accumulated other comprehensive income   until   Net income   is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts recorded in   Accumulated other comprehensive income   will be released to   Net income   in periods following the maturity of the related derivative, rather than at maturity. Effective hedge results are classified within the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. The results of hedges of non-functional currency denominated revenues and product cost exposures, excluding embedded derivatives, are recorded in   Revenues   or   Cost of sales   when the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated   Net income  . Results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. Amounts recorded in   Accumulated other comprehensive income   related to forward-starting interest rate swaps will be released through   Interest expense (income), net   as interest expense is incurred over the term of the issued debt. Results of hedges of anticipated purchases and sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in     Other (income) expense, net     when the securities are sold. Results of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in   Other (income) expense, net     when the transaction occurs. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the   Cash provided by operations   component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Premiums paid or received on options are initially recorded as deferred charges or deferred credits, respectively. The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options  fair value to   Accumulated other comprehensive income   to the degree they are effective. 
  The Company formally assesses, both at a hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on changes in forward rates  . Ineffectiveness was   immaterial   for the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  . 
  The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (1) it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. 
  When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, but is expected to occur within an additional   two  -month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in   Accumulated other comprehensive income   and is reclassified to   Net income   when the forecasted transaction affects consolidated   Net income  . However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were in   Accumulated other comprehensive income   will be recognized immediately in   Other (income) expense, net  . In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recognizing future changes in the fair value in   Other (income) expense, net  . For the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , the amounts recorded in   Other (income) expense, net   as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring were   immaterial  . 
  As of   May 31, 2017  ,   $100 million   of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in   Accumulated other comprehensive income   are expected to be reclassified to   Net income   during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in   Net income  . Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to   Net income   are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of   May 31, 2017  , the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was   24   months. 
  Fair Value Hedges 
  The Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Company s fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected within the   Cash provided by operations   component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   The Company recorded   no   ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   or   2015  . On October 15, 2015, the Company repaid the long-term debt which had previously been hedged with these interest rate swaps. Accordingly, a  s of   May 31, 2017  , the Company had   no   interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges. 
  Net Investment Hedges 
  The Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in   Accumulated other comprehensive income   along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the   Cash used by investing activities   component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded   no   ineffectiveness from net investment hedges for the years ended   May 31, 2017  ,   2016   or   2015  .   The Company had   no   outstanding net investment hedges as of   May 31, 2017  .

Undesignated Derivative Instruments 
  The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or the embedded derivative contracts. These forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, these undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in   Other (income) expense, net  , together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from undesignated instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the   Cash provided by operations   component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was   $10.5 billion   as of   May 31, 2017  . 
  Embedded Derivatives 
  As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory s acceptance of NIKE s purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in   Other (income) expense, net  , from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through the date the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations. 
  In addition, the Company has entered into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. These payment terms expose NIKE to variability in foreign exchange rates and create embedded derivative contracts that must be bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as   derivative assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding changes in fair value recognized in   Other (income) expense, net   until each payment is settled. 
  At   May 31, 2017  , the total notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately   $265 million  . 
  Credit Risk 
  The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Company s exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. 
  The Company s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties  creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Company s bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of     $50 million     should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than     $50 million  .   Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of   May 31, 2017  , the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and had derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position of   $59 million  . However, no derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position were greater than   $50 million   by counterparty. Accordingly,   the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of   May 31, 2017  , the Company had received   no   cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer to   Note 6   Fair Value Measurements  ). Given the considerations described above, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be     immaterial  . 
   
               NOTE 17   Operating Segments and Related Information 

The Company s operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. 
  Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central   Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. 
  In June 2017, NIKE, Inc. announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizational realignment, beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand will be: North America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific and Latin America. 
  The Company s NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer (DTC) operations are, and will continue to be, managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company, and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. 
  Global Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarily represents NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand.  
  Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Company s headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. 
  
   70 

     Table of Contents  

The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as  EBIT ), which represents   Net income   before   Interest expense (income), net   and   Income tax expense   in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established.   Inventories   and   Cost of sales   for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. 
  Accounts receivable, net  ,   Inventories   and   Property, plant and equipment, net   for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures.

The Company s largest concentrations of long-lived assets primarily consist of the Company s world headquarters and distribution facilities in the United States and distribution facilities in Belgium, China and Japan. Long-lived assets attributable to operations in the United States, which are primarily composed of net property, plant   equipment, were   $2,629 million   and   $2,241 million   at   May 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively. Long-lived assets attributable to operations in Belgium were   $390 million   and   $348 million   at   May 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively.

 COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.20 

COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT 
    
  PARTIES: 
    
  Michael Spillane ("EMPLOYEE") 
    
  and 
    
  NIKE, Inc.  ,   and its parent, divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns ("NIKE"): 
    
  RECITALS: 
    
           A  
    This Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement is executed upon EMPLOYEE's bona fide advancement with NIKE and is a condition of such advancement. Employee acknowledges that he/she was   informed   in a written job offer at   least   two weeks before starting work in his/her new position that this Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement is required and is a condition of advancement. 
       
           A. 
    Over the course of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE, EMPLOYEE will be or has been exposed to and/or is in a position to develop confidential information peculiar to NIKE's business and not generally known to the public as defined below ("Protected Information"). It is anticipated that EMPLOYEE will continue to be exposed to Protected Information of greater sensitivity as EMPLOYEE advances in the company, and this Agreement will remain in effect in the event EMPLOYEE advances and until EMPLOYEE leaves the company or it is superseded by a new written agreement executed by the parties. 
       
           B. 
    The nature of NIKE's business is highly competitive, and disclosure of any Protected Information would result in severe damage to NIKE and be difficult to measure. 
       
           C. 
    NIKE makes use of its Protected Information throughout the world. Protected Information of NIKE can be used to NIKE's detriment anywhere in the world. 
       
  AGREEMENT: 
  In   consideration of the foregoing, and the terms and conditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows: 
    
           1. 
    Covenant Not to Compete  . 
       
           (a) 
    Competition Restriction  .   During EMPLOYEE's employment by NIKE, under the 
     terms of any employment contract or otherwise, and for one (1) year thereafter (the "Restriction Period"), EMPLOYEE will not directly or indirectly  own,  manage, control or participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be employed by, consult for or be connected in any manner with, any business  engaged anywhere in the world in the athletic footwear, athletic apparel or sports equipment, sports electronics/technology and sports accessories business, or any other business that directly competes with NIKE or any of its parent, subsidiaries or affiliated corporations (a "Competitor").  This provision is subject to NIKE s option to waive all or any porti 

on of the Restriction Period as more specifically provided below. 
    
           (b) 
    Extension of Time  .      In the event EMPLOYEE breaches this covenant not to compete, the Restriction Period shall automatically toll from the date of the first breach, and all subsequent breaches, until the resolution of the breach through private settlement, judicial or other action, including all appeals. The Restriction Period shall continue upon the effective date of any such settlement, judicial or other resolution. NIKE shall not be obligated to pay EMPLOYEE the additional compensation described in paragraph 1.1 below during any period of time in which this Agreement is tolled due to EMPLOYEE s breach.   In the event EMPLOYEE receives such additional compensation after any such breach, EMPLOYEE must immediately reimburse NIKE in the amount of all such compensation upon the receipt of a written request by NIKE. 
       
           (c) 
    Waiver of Non-Compete  .     NIKE has the option, in its sole discretion, to elect to waive all or a portion of the Restriction Period or to limit the definition of Competitor by giving EMPLOYEE seven (7) days' prior notice of such election.  In the event all or a portion of the Restriction Period is waived or the definition of Competitor is limited, NIKE shall not be obligated to pay EMPLOYEE for   any period of time as to which the covenant not to compete has been waived. 
       
           (d) 
    Additional Consideration  .      As additional consideration for the covenant not to compete described above, should   NIKE terminate EMPLOYEE's   employment without cause and elect to enforce the non-competition agreement, while the Restriction Period is in effect, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal to one hundred percent (100%) of EMPLOYEE s last monthly base salary. Except where prohibited by law, if NIKE terminates EMPLOYEE for "cause," no additional consideration will be owed to EMPLOYEE under this Agreement, and the covenant not to   compete will   remain enforceable.  For  purposes  of  this Agreement  only, "cause" shall   mean (i)  insubordination,  (ii) acts of dishonesty,  (iii) involvement  in illegal  activities where such involvement in illegal activities  violates NIKE policies, places NIKE at risk or has or could damage NIKE's reputation in the community or any  of  its  related or subsidiary companies, (iv) violation of NIKE's anti-harassment or anti-discrimination policy or (v) gross neglect of EMPLOYEE'S duties or willful  misconduct that, in either case, results in economic harm to  NIKE or  harm to  NIKE's reputation. Nothing in this paragraph or Agreement alters the employment-at-will relationship between NIKE and EMPLOYEE. 
       
  If EMPLOYEE voluntarily terminates employment and NIKE elects to enforce the non-competition agreement, while the Restriction Period is in effect, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal to the greater of fifty percent (50%) of   EMPLOYEE  '  s last monthly base salary or the equivalent of one-twelfth (1/12) of fifty percent of the median family income for a four-person family in the state where EMPLOYEE resides, as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau for the most recent year available at the time of EMPLOYEE's termination.     The first payment to EMPLOYEE of additional consideration shall follow on the last business day of the month after NIKE's election to enforce the non-competition agreement. Subsequent payments during the Restriction Period shall be payable monthly on   the   last business day of the month in accordance with NIKE's payroll practices. 
    
           (e) 
    Withholding and Offset  .    NIKE reserves the right to withhold from Additional Consideration payable to EMPLOYEE all federal, state and local taxes as shall be required, as well as any other amounts authorized or required by NIKE policy. NIKE reserves the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to reduce the amount of Additional  

Consideration by amounts that EMPLOYEE owes NIKE, including but not limited to any payments due to NIKE in accordance with the NIKE Tax Equalization Policy if EMPLOYEE is employed as a transferee during his or her employment with NIKE. Employee agrees that notwithstanding the amount of any withholding and/or offset, even in an amount that reduces payments of Additional Consideration to zero dollars ($0.00), the covenant not to compete will remain enforceable.  To the extent withholding or offset does not extinguish amounts that EMPLOYEE owes to NIKE, EMPLOYEE remains obligated for the balance of the amounts owed. 
    
           2. 
    Subsequent   Employer  .     EMPLOYEE agrees to notify NIKE at the time of separation of employment of the name of EMPLOYEE s new employer, if known.  EMPLOYEE further agrees to disclose to NIKE the name of any subsequent employer during the Restriction Period, wherever located and regardless of whether such employer is a competitor of NIKE. 
       
           3. 
    Non-Disclosure Agreement  . 
       
           (a) 
    Protected Information Defined  .  "Protected information" shall mean all proprietary information, in whatever form and format, of NIKE and all information provided to NIKE by third parties that NIKE is obligated to keep confidential. EMPLOYEE agrees that any and all information to which EMPLOYEE has access concerning NIKE projects and internal NIKE information is Protected Information, whether in verbal form, machine-readable form, written or other tangible form, and whether designated as confidential or unmarked.  Without limiting the foregoing, Protected Information includes trade secrets and competitively sensitive business or professional  information  (regardless of  whether such information  constitutes  a trade secret)  relating to NIKE's research and development activities, its intellectual property and the filing or pendency of patent applications, confidential techniques, methods, styles, designs, design  concepts and ideas, customer and vendor lists, contract factory lists, pricing information, manufacturing plans, business and marketing plans  or  strategy,  product development plans, product launch plans, financial information, sales information, methods of operation, manufacturing processes and methods, products and personnel information. 
       
           (b) 
    Excluded Information  .     Notwithstanding paragraph 3(a), Protected Information excludes any information that   is   or becomes part of the public domain through no act or failure to act on the part of EMPLOYEE. Specifically, EMPLOYEE shall be permitted to retain as part of his or her personal portfolio copies of EMPLOYEE's original artwork and designs, provided EMPLOYEE presents those personal portfolio copies to his or her supervisor for review and approval and provided the artwork or designs have become part of the public domain.  In any dispute between the parties with respect to this exclusion, the burden of proof will be on EMPLOYEE, and such proof will be by clear and convincing evidence. 
       
           (c) 
    Employee's Obligations  .   During the period of employment by NIKE and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, EMPLOYEE will hold in confidence and protect all Protected Information and will not, at any time, directly or indirectly, use any Protected Information for any purpose outside the scope of   EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE or disclose any Protected Information to any third person or organization without the prior written consent of NIKE. Specifically, but not by way of limitation, EMPLOYEE will not ever copy, transmit, reproduce, summarize, quote, publish or make any commercial or other use whatsoever of any Protected Information without the prior written consent of NIKE.   EMPLOYEE will also take reasonable security precautions and such other actions as may be necessary to ensure that there is no use  

or disclosure, intentional or inadvertent, of Protected Information in violation of this Agreement. 
    
           4. 
    Return of     Protected      Information  .     At   the    request of  NIKE at any time,  and in  any event, upon  termination  of   employment,   EMPLOYEE   shall   immediately   return to   NIKE all Protected Information in whatever form, including   tapes,   notebooks, drawings, digital files or   other   media   containing   Protected   Information,   and   all   copies   thereof, then in EMPLOYEE's possession or under EMPLOYEE's control. 
       
           5. 
    Unauthorized Use  .     During   the   period   of   employment   with   NIKE  and   thereafter, EMPLOYEE   will   notify   NIKE   immediately    if   EMPLOYEE   becomes   aware of  the unauthorized  possession,  use or  knowledge of any  Protected  Information  by any person employed or  not employed  by NIKE at the time  of  such  possession,  use  or knowledge. EMPLOYEE will cooperate with NIKE in the investigation of any  such  incident and will cooperate with NIKE  in  any  litigation  with  third  parties deemed  necessary  by  NIKE  to protect  the  Protected  Information.   NIKE  shall  provide reasonable  reimbursement  to EMPLOYEE  for  each  hour  so  engaged,  and   that  amount  shall  not  be  diminished  by operation of any payment under paragraph 1(d)   of this Agreement. 
       
           6. 
    Non-Solicitation/Non-Recruitment  .    During the term  of this Agreement  and for  a period of one (1) year thereafter, EMPLOYEE will not directly or indirectly solicit,  divert  or hire away (or attempt to solicit, divert or hire away) to or for himself or any other company or business organization any NIKE employee, whether or not such employee is a full-time employee or temporary employee and whether or not such employment is pursuant to a written agreement or is at will or any independent contractor working for NIKE. 
       
           7. 
    Accounting   of  Profits  .     EMPLOYEE  agrees that,  if EMPLOYEE should violate any term of this Agreement, NIKE shall be entitled to an accounting and repayment  of  all  profits, compensation,  commissions,  remuneration   or   benefits   that   EMPLOYEE   directly   or indirectly  has realized  and/or  may  realize as a  result  of  or  in connection  with any  such violation  (including  the  return  of any  additional  consideration  paid by  NIKE  pursuant  to paragraph  1(d)  above).   Such  remedy  shall  be in addition to  and not  in limitation of any   injunctive relief or other rights or remedies to which NIKE may be entitled at  law or in equity. 
       
           8. 
    General Provisions  . 
       
           (a) 
    Survival. This Agreement shall continue in effect after the termination of EMPLOYEE's employment, regardless of the reason for termination. 
       
           (b) 
    Waiver. No waiver, amendment, modification or cancellation of any term  or condition of this Agreement will be effective unless executed in writing by both parties. No written waiver will excuse the  performance  of any  act other  than the act or acts specifically referred to therein. 
       
           (c) 
    Severability. Each provision herein will be   treated   as a separate and independent clause, and unenforceability of any one clause will in no way impact the enforceability of any other clause. Should any of the provisions in this  Agreement be found to be unreasonable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be enforceable to the maximum extent enforceable by the law of that jurisdiction. 
       
           (d) 
    Applicable Law/Jurisdiction. This Agreement, and EMPLOYEE's employment hereunder, shall be construed according to the laws of the state of Oregon.  

EMPLOYEE further hereby submits to the jurisdiction of, and agrees that exclusive jurisdiction over and venue for, any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall lie in the state and federal courts located in Oregon.
