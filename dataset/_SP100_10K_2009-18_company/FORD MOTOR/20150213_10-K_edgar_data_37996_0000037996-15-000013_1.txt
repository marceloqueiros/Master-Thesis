      Item 1.  Business (Continued)                                                                                                                                                                          

   OVERVIEW 
    
  Segments.    We review and present our business results in two sectors:  Automotive and Financial Services.  Within these sectors, our business is divided into reportable segments (referred to herein as  segments,   business units,  or  regions ) based on the organizational structure that we use to evaluate performance and make decisions on resource allocation, as well as availability and materiality of separate financial results consistent with that structure. 
    
  The reportable segments within our Automotive and Financial Services sectors at December 31, 2014 were as described in the table below: 
                   Business Sector

AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR 
    
  General 
    
  Our vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln.  In 2014, we sold approximately 6,323,000 vehicles at wholesale throughout the world.  See  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ( Item 7 ) for discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volumes. 
    
  Substantially all of our vehicles, parts, and accessories are sold through distributors and dealers (collectively,  dealerships ), the substantial majority of which are independently owned.  At December 31, 2014, the approximate number of dealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands was as follows: 

We do not depend on any single customer or a few customers to the extent that the loss of such customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.  
    
  In addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale, we also sell vehicles to our dealerships for sale to fleet customers, including commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments.  We also sell parts and accessories, primarily to our dealerships (which in turn sell these products to retail customers) and to authorized parts distributors (which in turn primarily sell these products to retailers).  We also offer extended service contracts.  
    
  The worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic conditions over which we have little control.  Vehicles are durable goods, and consumers have latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing vehicle.  The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth,  
    2 

    Item 1.  Business (Continued)                                                                                                                                                                          

   geopolitical events, and other factors (including the cost of purchasing and operating cars and trucks and the availability and cost of financing and fuel).  As we recently have seen in the United States and Europe, in particular, the number of cars and trucks sold may vary substantially from year to year.  Further, the automotive industry is a highly competitive business that has a wide and growing variety of product offerings from a growing number of manufacturers. 
    
  Our wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand.  Our wholesale unit volumes also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory.  Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived in comparison to those offered by other manufacturers based on many factors, including price, quality, styling, reliability, safety, fuel efficiency, functionality, and reputation.  Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions.  Our ability to satisfy changing consumer preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle, as well as design and performance characteristics, affects our sales and earnings significantly. 
    
  As with other manufacturers, the profitability of our business is affected by many factors, including: 

Wholesale unit volumes 
                
    Margin of profit on each vehicle sold - which in turn is affected by many factors, such as: 
                
    Market factors - volume and mix of vehicles and options sold, and net pricing (reflecting, among other factors, incentive programs)   
                
    Costs of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles 
                
    Costs for customer warranty claims and additional service actions 
                
    Costs for safety, emissions, and fuel economy technology and equipment 
                
    A high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can significantly affect overall profitability 
       
  Our industry has a very competitive pricing environment, driven in part by industry excess capacity, which is concentrated in Europe and Asia but affects other markets because much of this capacity can be redirected to other markets.  The decline in the value of the yen during the past three years also has contributed significantly to competitive pressures in many of our markets.  For the past several decades, manufacturers typically have given price discounts and other marketing incentives to maintain market share and production levels.  A discussion of our strategies to compete in this pricing environment is set forth in the  Overview  section in Item 7. 
    
  Competitive Position.    The worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers, with no single dominant producer.  Certain manufacturers, however, account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries, especially their countries of origin.  Key competitors with global presence include Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, General Motors Company, Honda Motor Company, Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Renault-Nissan B.V., Suzuki Motor Corporation, Toyota Motor Corporation, and Volkswagen AG Group.   
    
  Seasonality.    We generally record the sale of a vehicle (and recognize revenue) when it is produced and shipped or delivered to our customer (i.e., the dealership).  See the  Overview  section in Item 7 for additional discussion of revenue recognition practices. 
    
  We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors, including retail sales (i.e., units sold by our dealerships to their customers at retail) and dealer stock levels (i.e., the number of units held in inventory by our dealerships for sale to their customers).  Historically, we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in the business, with production in many markets tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer (typically the strongest sales months of the year).   
    
  Raw Materials.    We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in production of our vehicles.  These materials include base metals (e.g., steel, iron castings, and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene).  We believe we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs.  There always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials, however, which could impact availability in sufficient quantities to meet our needs.  See the  Overview  section of Item 7 for a discussion of commodity and energy price trends, and  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  ( Item 7A ) for a discussion of commodity price risks. 
    
  Backlog Orders.    We generally produce and ship our products on average within approximately 20 days after an order is deemed to become firm.  Therefore, no significant amount of backlog orders accumulates during any period.

    Item 1.  Business (Continued)                                                                                                                                                                          

   Intellectual Property.    We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, copyrights, and trademarks on a global basis.  Our policy is to protect our competitive position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and international patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business.  We have generated a large number of patents, and expect this portfolio to continue to grow as we actively pursue additional technological innovation.  We currently have approximately 30,400 active patents and pending patent applications globally, with an average age for patents in our active patent portfolio of just under five and a half years.  In addition to this intellectual property, we also rely on our proprietary knowledge and ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.  Although we believe these patents, patent applications, and know-how, in the aggregate, are important to the conduct of our business, and we obtain licenses to use certain intellectual property owned by others, none is individually considered material to our business.  We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our Company and its products and services globally.  Certain of these marks are integral to the conduct of our business, a loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
    
  Warranty Coverage, Field Service Actions, and Customer Satisfaction Actions.    We currently provide warranties on vehicles we sell.  Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage, and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale.   Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust all parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period.  In addition to the costs associated with this warranty coverage provided on our vehicles, we also incur costs as a result of field service actions (i.e., safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns), and for customer satisfaction actions. 
    
  For additional information regarding warranty and related costs, see  Critical Accounting Estimates  in Item 7 and Note 27 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

   FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR 
    
  Ford Motor Credit Company LLC 
    
  Our wholly-owned subsidiary Ford Motor Credit Company LLC ( Ford Credit ) offers a wide variety of automotive financing products to and through automotive dealers throughout the world.  The predominant share of Ford Credit s business consists of financing our vehicles and supporting our dealers.  Ford Credit earns its revenue primarily from payments made under retail installment sale and lease contracts that it originates and purchases; interest rate supplements and other support payments from us and our subsidiaries; and payments made under dealer financing programs. 
    
  As a result of these financing activities, Ford Credit has a large portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases which it classifies into two portfolios   consumer  and  non-consumer.   Finance receivables and operating leases in the consumer portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of our vehicles from dealers for personal and commercial use.  Retail financing includes retail installment sale contracts for new and used vehicles and direct financing leases for new vehicles to retail customers, government entities, daily rental car companies, and fleet customers.  Finance receivables in the non-consumer portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers.  Ford Credit makes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory (i.e., floorplan financing), as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership real estate, and finance other dealer vehicle programs.  Ford Credit also purchases receivables generated by us and our subsidiaries, primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers, receivables from Ford-related loans, and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet companies. 
    
  Ford Credit does business in the United States and Canada through business centers.  Outside of the United States, Europe is Ford Credit s largest operation.  Ford Credit s European operation is managed through its United Kingdom-based subsidiary, FCE Bank plc ( FCE ).  Within Europe, FCE s largest markets are the United Kingdom and Germany, representing approximately 67% of FCE s finance receivables and operating leases.  
    
  The following table shows Ford Credit s financing shares of new Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold by dealers in the United States and new Ford vehicles sold by dealers in Europe, as well as its wholesale financing shares of new Ford and Lincoln vehicles acquired by dealers in the United States (excluding fleet) and new Ford vehicles acquired by dealers in Europe: 

See Item 7 and Notes 5, 6, and 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of Ford Credit s receivables, credit losses, allowance for credit losses, loss-to-receivables ratios, funding sources, and funding strategies. See Item 7A for discussion of how Ford Credit manages its financial market risks. 
    
  We routinely sponsor special retail and lease incentives to dealers  customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit.  In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract.  These programs increase Ford Credit s financing volume and share.  See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information about our accounting for these programs. 
    
  On April 30, 2014, we entered into a Relationship Agreement with Ford Credit, pursuant to which, if Ford Credit s managed leverage for a calendar quarter were to be higher than 11.5 to 1 (as reported in its most recent periodic report), Ford Credit could require us to make or cause to be made a capital contribution to it in an amount sufficient to have caused such managed leverage to have been 11.5 to 1.  No capital contributions have been made pursuant to this agreement.  The agreement also limits to $2 billion the amount Ford Credit may borrow under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2014.  In a separate agreement with FCE, Ford Credit also has agreed to maintain FCE s net worth in excess of $500 million; no payments have been made pursuant to that agreement.

      Item 1.  Business (Continued)                                                                                                                                                                          

   GOVERNMENTAL STANDARDS 
    
  Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere.      In addition, manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances.  The most significant of the standards and regulations affecting us are discussed below: 
    
  Vehicle Emissions Control 
    
  U.S. Requirements - Federal Emissions Standards.      The federal Clean Air Act imposes stringent limits on the amount of regulated pollutants that lawfully may be emitted by new vehicles and engines produced for sale in the United States.  In     2014, the EPA finalized new  Tier 3  regulations that phase in increasingly stringent motor vehicle emissions standards beginning with the 2017 model year; compliance with these standards could be challenging.  Compliance with automobile emission standards depends in part on the widespread availability of high-quality and consistent automotive fuels that the vehicles were designed to use.  Fuel variables that can affect vehicle emissions include ethanol content, octane rating, and the use of metallic-based fuel additives, among other things.  There are various ongoing regulatory and judicial proceedings related to fuel quality at the national and state level, and the outcome of these proceedings could affect vehicle manufacturers  warranty costs as well as their ability to comply with vehicle emission standards. 
        
  U.S. Requirements - California and Other State Emissions Standards.      Pursuant to the Clean Air Act, California may establish its own unique vehicle emissions control standards; the California standards can also be adopted by other states.  The California Air Resources Board has adopted  LEV III  standards, which took effect with the 2015 model year and impose increasingly stringent tailpipe and evaporative emissions requirements for light and medium duty vehicles.  Thirteen states, primarily located in the Northeast and Northwest, have adopted the LEV III standards. 
    
  The California vehicle emissions program also includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale so-called zero-emission vehicles ( ZEVs ).  The current ZEV regulations mandate substantial annual increases in the production and sale of battery-electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, particularly for the 2018 - 2025 model years.  By the 2025 model year, approximately 15% of a manufacturer s total California sales volume will need to be made up of such vehicles.  Compliance with the 2018 - 2025 model year ZEV rules could have a substantial adverse effect on our sales volumes and profits.  We are concerned that the market and infrastructure in California may not support the large volumes of advanced-technology vehicles that manufacturers will be required to produce, especially if gasoline prices remain relatively low  .    We also are concerned about enforcement of the ZEV mandate in other states that have adopted California s ZEV program, where the existence of a market for such vehicles is even less certain.  CARB conducts periodic reviews of its upcoming ZEV requirements, taking into account factors such as technology developments and market acceptance.  Ford and the industry will be active participants in such reviews, with the goal of ensuring that ZEV requirements are feasible and not excessively burdensome. 
      
  European Requirements.      European Union ( EU ) directives and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the EU.      Stringent new  Stage V  emissions standards took effect for vehicle registrations starting in January 2011; Stage     VI requirements apply from September     2014, with a second phase beginning in September 2017.      Stage V particulate standards drove the deployment of particulate filters in diesel engines, and Stage VI further tightens the standard for oxides of nitrogen.      This     will drive the need for additional diesel exhaust after-treatment, which will add cost and potentially impact the diesel CO   2    advantage.      These technology requirements add cost and further erode the fuel economy cost/benefit advantage of diesel vehicles.  The additional requirements for the second phase of Stage VI will further increase the stringency of particle emissions for direct injection gasoline vehicles, and apply more demanding on-board diagnostic thresholds for all vehicles.  The costs associated with additional testing that may be required for the second phase of Stage VI concerning real driving emissions could be significant.

      Item 1.  Business (Continued)                                                                                                                                                                          

   Other National Requirements.      Many countries, in an effort to address air quality concerns, are adopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ( UN-ECE ) mobile source emissions regulations.  Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of European or U.S. regulations; for example, China adopted emission regulations for large cities based on European Stage V emissions standards.  Korea and Taiwan have adopted very stringent U.S.-based standards for gasoline vehicles, and European-based standards for diesel vehicles.      Although these countries have adopted regulations based UN-ECE or U.S. standards, there may be some unique testing provisions that require emission-control systems to be redesigned for these markets.      Canadian criteria emissions regulations are aligned with U.S. Tier 2 requirements discussed above.  In September 2014, the Canadian federal government published the proposed amendments to the   On-Road Vehicle and Engine Emission Regulations   and the   Sulphur in Gasoline Regulations  .  The final regulations are expected to align standards with the U.S. Tier 3 regulations. 
    
  Furthermore, not all countries have adopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emissions standards adopted.      This could lead to compliance problems, particularly if on-board diagnostic or in-use surveillance requirements are implemented.  Japan has unique standards and test procedures, which may require that unique emissions control systems be designed for the Japanese market.        
    
  Brazil, Argentina, and Chile have also introduced more stringent emissions standards.  Since 2012, Brazil has applied European Stage V emissions and on-board diagnostic standards for heavy trucks, and more stringent light vehicle limits.  Argentina also will apply light vehicle Stage V standards beginning in 2015 (for new vehicle homologations) and 2017 (for new vehicle registrations).  Chile introduced more stringent emission standards (i.e., European Stage V or corresponding U.S. emissions standards) nationwide for light and medium duty vehicles     in September 2014.  Since October 2014, new heavy duty vehicle models are required to meet Stage V (or corresponding U.S. emissions standards).  All other new heavy vehicles are required to meet these standards beginning October 2015. 
    
  Vehicle Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Standards 
    
  U.S. Requirements - Light Duty Vehicles  .    Federal law requires that light duty vehicles meet minimum corporate average fuel economy ( CAFE ) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ).      A manufacturer is subject to substantial civil penalties if it fails to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all available credits for the preceding three model years and expected credits for the five succeeding model years.  The law requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each manufacturer s fleet of domestic passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light trucks, respectively. 
    
  The EPA also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.  Because the vast majority of greenhouse gases emitted by a vehicle are the result of fuel combustion, greenhouse gas emission standards effectively are fuel economy standards.  Thus, it is necessary for NHTSA and EPA to coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and greenhouse gas ( GHG ) standards, respectively, to avoid potential inconsistencies.  
    
  In 2010, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated regulations establishing the  One National Program  of CAFE and GHG regulations for light duty vehicles for the 2012-2016 model years.  In 2012, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated regulations extending the One National Program framework through the 2025 model year.  These rules require manufacturers to achieve, across the industry, a light duty fleet average fuel economy of approximately 35.5 mpg by the 2016 model year, 45 mpg by the 2021 model year, and 54.5 mpg by the 2025     model year.  Each manufacturer s specific task depends on the mix of vehicles it sells. The rules include the opportunity for manufacturers to earn credits for technologies that achieve real-world CO   2    reductions, and fuel economy improvements that are not captured by EPA fuel economy test procedures.  Manufacturers also can earn credits for GHG reductions not specifically tied to fuel economy, such as improvements in air conditioning systems. 
    
  The One National Program standards become increasingly stringent over time, and they will be difficult to meet if fuel prices remain relatively low and market conditions do not drive consumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuel-efficient vehicles in large numbers.  The rules provide for a midterm evaluation process under which, by 2018, EPA and NHTSA will re-evaluate their standards for model years 2022-2025 in order to ensure that those standards are feasible and optimal in light of intervening events.  We are particularly concerned about the commercial feasibility of meeting the 2022-2025 model year GHG and CAFE standards, and therefore the midterm evaluation process is very important to Ford and the auto industry.  Ford s ability to comply with the 2022-2025 model year standards remains unclear because of the many unknowns regarding technology development, market conditions, and other factors so far into the future.  We intend to be an active participant in the midterm evaluation process for these standards.  Our concern about the feasibility of the fuel economy / GHG standards also extends to some of the pre-2022 model year standards, which are not covered by the midterm evaluation. 
    10 

      Item 1.  Business (Continued)                                                                                                                                                                          

   If the agencies seek to impose and enforce fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market conditions, we likely would be forced to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on our sales volume and profits.  Such actions likely would include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options; increasing market support programs for our most fuel-efficient cars and light trucks; and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicles such as high-performance cars, utilities, and/or full-size light trucks, in order to maintain compliance. 
    
  California has asserted the right to regulate motor vehicle GHG emissions, and other states have asserted the right to adopt the California standards.  With the adoption of the federal One National Program standards discussed above, California and the other states have agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with any purported state GHG requirements for the 2012-2025 model years.  This avoids a patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state GHG standards.  Should California and other states ever renew their efforts to enforce state-specific motor vehicle GHG rules, this would impose significant costs on automotive manufacturers.   
    
  U.S. Requirements - Heavy Duty Vehicles.    EPA and NHTSA have jointly promulgated GHG and fuel economy standards on heavy duty vehicles (generally, vehicles over 8,500     pounds gross vehicle weight rating).  In our case, the standards primarily affect our heavy duty pickup trucks and vans, plus vocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks.  In 2015, EPA and NHTSA are expected to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking on a new round of standards for these vehicles, covering model year 2019 and beyond.  Ford plans to review and comment on the proposed standards.  As the heavy-duty standards increase in stringency, it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavy duty trucks.    
    
  European Requirements.    In December 2008, the EU approved regulation of passenger car CO   2    emissions beginning in 2012 that limits the industry fleet average to a maximum of 130 grams per kilometer ( g/km ), using a sliding scale based on vehicle weight.  This regulation provides different targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for its fleet of vehicles.  Limited credits are available for CO   2    off-cycle actions ( eco-innovations ), certain alternative fuels, and vehicles with CO   2    emissions below 50 g/km.  A penalty system will apply for manufacturers failing to meet targets, with fees ranging from      5 to      95 per vehicle per g/km shortfall in the years 2012 2018, and      95 per g/km shortfall beginning in 2019.  Manufacturers will be permitted to use a pooling agreement between wholly-owned brands to share the burden.  Further pooling agreements between different manufacturers also are possible, although it is not clear that these will be of much practical benefit under the regulations.  Starting in 2020, an industry target of 95 g/km has been set.  Other non-EU European countries are likely to follow with similar regulations.  For example, Switzerland has introduced similar rules, which began phasing-in starting in July 2012 with the same targets (which likely also will include a 2020 target of 95 g/km), although the industry average emission target is significantly higher.  We face the risk of advance premium payment requirements if, for example, unexpected market fluctuation within a quarter negatively impact our average fleet performance. 
    
  In separate legislation,  complementary measures  have been mandated, including requirements related to fuel economy indicators, and more-efficient low-CO   2    mobile air conditioning systems.      The EU Commission, Council and Parliament have approved a target for commercial light duty vehicles to be at an industry average of 175 g/km (with phase-in from 2014 2017), and 147 g/km in 2020;     it is likely that other European countries, like Switzerland, will implement similar rules but under even more difficult conditions.  This regulation also provides different targets for each manufacturer based on its respective average vehicle weight in its fleet of vehicles.      The final mass and CO   2    requirements for so-called  multi-stage vehicles  (e.g., our Transit chassis cabs) are fully allocated to the base manufacturer (e.g., Ford) so that the base manufacturer is fully responsible for the CO   2    performance of the final up-fitted vehicles.      The EU proposal also includes a penalty system,  super-credits  for vehicles below 50     g/km, and limited credits for CO   2    off-cycle eco-innovations, pooling, etc., similar to the passenger car CO   2    regulation. 
    
  The United Nations has a project underway to develop a new technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO   2.     This new world light duty test procedure ( WLTP ) is focused primarily on delivering realistic CO   2    and fuel consumption figures.  The introduction of WLTP in Europe is likely to start with updates to CO   2    labeling beginning in 2019 and could lower certain consumer label values.  Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP could be significant.  The European Commission continues to apply political pressure for mandatory WLTP testing for regulated emissions and CO   2     starting in September 2017.  The European Commission has assured equivalent stringency to the existing fleet average rules for each automobile manufacturer if the 2020 fleet average targets are required to be measured on WLTP instead of under the current European NEDC requirements.

      Item 1.  Business (Continued)                                                                                                                                                                          

   Some European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO   2    vehicle emissions, including fiscal measures and CO   2    labeling.      For example, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, among others, have introduced taxation based on CO   2    emissions.      The EU CO   2    requirements are likely to trigger further measures.  To limit GHG emissions, the EU directive on mobile air conditioning currently requires the replacement of the current refrigerant with a lower  global warming potential  refrigerant for new vehicle types, and for all newly registered vehicles starting in January 2017.  A refrigerant change adds considerable costs along the whole value chain. 
    
  Other National Requirements.      The Canadian federal government has regulated vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, beginning with the 2011 model year.      The standards track the new U.S. CAFE standards for the 2011 model year and U.S. EPA GHG regulations for the 2012-2016 model years.      In October, 2014, the Canadian federal government published the final changes to the regulation for light duty vehicles, which maintain alignment with U.S. EPA vehicle GHG standards for the 2017-2025 model years.  The final regulation for 2014-2018 heavy duty vehicles was published in February 2013.  
    
  Mexico adopted fuel economy/CO   2    standards, based on the U.S. One National Program framework, that took effect in 2014. 
    
  Many Asia Pacific countries (such as Australia, China, Japan, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam) are developing or enforcing fuel efficiency or labeling targets.  For example, South Korea and Japan have set fuel efficiency targets for 2020, with incentives for early adoption.  China published standards for Stage IV fuel efficiency targets for 2016 2020.  The fuel efficiency targets will impact the cost of vehicle technology in the future. 
    
  In South America, Brazil introduced a voluntary vehicle energy-efficiency labeling program, indicating fuel consumption rates for light duty vehicles with a spark ignition engine.  Brazil also published a new automotive regime which requires participation in the fuel economy labeling program.  It establishes a minimum absolute CAFE value as a function of Fleet Corporate Average Mass for 2017 light duty vehicles with a spark ignition engine in order to qualify for industrialized products tax reduction for customers.  Additional tax reductions are available if further fuel efficiency improvements are achieved.  A severe penalty system will apply to qualified manufacturers failing to meet fuel efficiency requirement for the 2013 2017 sales period.  Chile introduced requirements for fuel consumption and CO   2    emissions levels of light duty vehicles to be posted at sales locations and in owner manuals beginning in February 2013.  Chile introduced a tax based on urban fuel consumption and NOx emission for light and medium vehicles beginning in late 2014.  In general, fuel efficiency targets may impact the cost of technology of our models in the future. 
    
  Vehicle Safety 
    
  U.S. Requirements.    The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the  Safety Act ) regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in two primary ways.  First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA.  Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards.  Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns.  A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard.  Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.

      Item 1.  Business (Continued)                                                                                                                                                                          

   Other National Requirements.      The EU and many countries around the world have established vehicle safety standards and regulations, and are likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirements in the future.      The European General Safety Regulation introduced United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ( UN-ECE ) regulations, which will be required for the European Type Approval process.      EU regulators also are focusing on active safety features such as lane departure warning systems, electronic stability control, and automatic brake assist.      Globally, governments generally have been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with minor variations to address local concerns.      Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to the development of global platform vehicles, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing a common level of safety performance; several recently launched bilateral negotiations on free trade can potentially contribute to this goal.  New safety and recall requirements in China, India, and Gulf Cooperation Council countries also may add substantial costs and complexity to our global recall practice.  In South America, additional safety requirements are being introduced or proposed in Argentina, Brazil, Chile (mainly for heavy vehicles), Ecuador, and Uruguay, influenced by Latin NCAP, which may be a driver for similar actions in other countries.  In Canada, regulatory requirements are currently aligned with U.S. regulations.  However, recent amendments to the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act could introduce broad powers to the Minister of Transport to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it would be in the interest of safety. 
    
    EMPLOYMENT DATA 
    
  The approximate number of individuals employed by us and entities that we consolidated as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows (in thousands):  

The year-over-year increase in employment primarily reflects hiring in North America and Asia Pacific to support product-led growth initiatives and increased vehicle production.  
    
  Substantially all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements.  In the United States, approximately 99% of these unionized hourly employees in our Automotive sector are represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America ( UAW  or  United Auto Workers ).  Approximately 1.5% of our U.S. salaried employees are represented by unions.  Most hourly employees and many non-management salaried employees at our operations outside of the United States also are represented by unions. 
    
  In 2011, we entered into a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the UAW.  The agreement covers approximately 50,000 employees, and maintained our progress on improving competitiveness in the United States by providing for lump-sum payments (in lieu of general wage increases and cost of living increases) and continuation of an entry-level wage structure.  
    
  In 2014, we negotiated collective bargaining agreements (covering wages, benefits and/or other employment provisions) with labor unions in Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, and Thailand.  
    
  In 2015, we will negotiate collective bargaining agreements (covering wages, benefits and/or other employment provisions) with labor unions in Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Romania, Russia, Thailand, United Kingdom, and United States. 
    
    ENGINEERING, RESEARCH, AND DEVELOPMENT 
    
  We engage in engineering, research, and development primarily to improve the performance (including fuel efficiency), safety, and customer satisfaction of our products, and to develop new products.  Engineering, research, and development expenses for 2014, 2013, and 2012 were $6.9 billion, $6.4 billion, and $5.5 billion, respectively.   
    13 

ITEM 1A.   Risk Factors. 
    
    We have listed below (not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence) the most significant risk factors applicable to us: 
    
  Decline in industry sales volume, particularly in the United States, Europe, or China, due to financial crisis, recession, geopolitical events, or other factors.    Because we, like other manufacturers, have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, relatively small changes in industry sales volume can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and profitability.  If industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption, particularly in the United States, Europe, or China, due to financial crisis, recession, geopolitical events, or other factors, such as occurred during 2008 and 2009, our financial condition and results of operations would be substantially adversely affected.  For discussion of economic trends, see the  Overview  section of Item 7. 
    
  Decline in Ford s market share or failure to achieve growth.    To maintain competitive economies of scale and grow our global market share, we must grow our market share in fast-growing newly developed and emerging markets, particularly in our Asia Pacific region and our Middle East   Africa region, as well as maintain or grow market share in mature markets.  Our market share in certain growing markets, such as China, is lower than it is in our mature markets.  A significant decline in our market share in mature markets or failure to achieve growth in newly developing or emerging markets, whether due to capacity constraints, competitive pressures, protectionist trade policies, or other factors, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of Ford s new or existing products.    Although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicles, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products in the marketplace.  Offering vehicles that customers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but vehicles that are perceived to be less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall value, fuel efficiency, or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks.  For example, if a new model were to experience quality issues at the time of launch, the vehicle s perceived quality could be affected even after the issues had been corrected, resulting in lower sales volumes, market share, and profitability.  In addition, with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media, and other media, mere allegations relating to quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate social responsibility, or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products, even where such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.    
    
  Market shift away from sales of larger, more profitable vehicles beyond Ford s current planning assumption, particularly in the United States.    A shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles at levels beyond our current planning assumption could result in an immediate and substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  Although we have a balanced portfolio of small, medium, and large cars, utilities, and trucks with competitive fuel efficiency, a shift in consumer preferences away from sales of larger, more profitable vehicles at levels greater than our current planning assumption whether because of spiking fuel prices, a decline in the construction industry, government actions or incentives, or other reasons still could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  An increase in or continued volatility of fuel prices, or reduced availability of fuel  .    An increase in fuel prices, continued price volatility, or reduced availability of fuel, particularly in the United States, could result in weakening of demand for relatively more-profitable large cars, utilities, and trucks, while increasing demand for relatively less-profitable small vehicles.  Continuation or acceleration of such a trend beyond our current planning assumption, or volatility in demand across segments, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Continued or increased price competition resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, or other factors.    The global automotive industry is intensely competitive, with manufacturing capacity far exceeding current demand.  According to the January 2015 report issued by IHS Automotive, the global automotive industry is estimated to have had excess capacity of about 29 million units in 2014.  Industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share; these incentives historically have included a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs, price rebates, and other incentives.  As a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher costs of marketing incentives, commodity or other cost increases, or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations, including pricing advantages foreign competitors may have because of their weaker home market currencies.  Continuation of or increased excess capacity could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

    Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)                                                                                                         

   Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates.    As a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, we are exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates.  These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors.  We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business.  Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged.  In addition, because of intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs, we may not be able to address such changes even if foreseeable.  As a result, substantial unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  See  Overview  to Item 7 and Item 7A for additional discussion of currency, commodity price, and interest rate risks. 
    
  Adverse effects resulting from economic, geopolitical, or other events.      With the increasing interconnectedness of global economic and financial systems, a financial crisis, natural disaster, geopolitical crisis, or other significant event in one area of the world can have an immediate and devastating impact on markets around the world.  For example, the financial crisis that began in the United States in 2008 quickly spread to other markets; natural disasters in Japan and Thailand during 2011 caused production interruptions and delays not just in Asia Pacific but other regions around the world; and episodes of increased geopolitical tensions or acts of terrorism have at times caused adverse reactions that may spread to economies around the globe.   
    
  Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain countries that have adopted the euro currency ( euro area countries ) and the ability of these countries to meet future financial obligations, as well as concerns regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual euro area countries.  If a country within the euro area were to default on its debt or withdraw from the euro currency, or in a more extreme circumstance the euro currency were to be dissolved entirely, the impact on markets around the world, and on Ford s global business, could be immediate and significant.  Such a scenario or the perception that such a development is imminent could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations.  In addition, such a development could cause financial and capital markets within and outside Europe to constrict, thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business, and also could cause a substantial dip in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact sales of vehicles.  Any one of these impacts could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   
    
  In addition, we have operations in various markets with volatile economic or political environments and are pursuing growth opportunities in a number of newly developed and emerging markets.  These investments may expose us to heightened risks of economic, geopolitical, or other events, including governmental takeover (i.e., nationalization) of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual property, restrictive exchange or import controls, disruption of operations as a result of systemic political or economic instability, outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities, and acts of terrorism, each of which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Further, the U.S. government and other governments could impose additional sanctions that could restrict us from doing business directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties, which could include affiliates. 
    
  Economic distress of suppliers that may require Ford to provide substantial financial support or take other measures to ensure supplies of components or materials and could increase costs, affect liquidity, or cause production constraints or disruptions.   The automotive industry supply base experienced increased economic distress due to the sudden and substantial drop in industry sales volumes beginning in 2008.  Dramatically lower industry sales volume made existing debt obligations and fixed cost levels difficult for many suppliers to manage, increasing pressure on the supply base.  As a result, suppliers not only were less willing to reduce prices, but some requested direct or indirect price increases as well as new and shorter payment terms.  At times, we have had to provide financial assistance to key suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of materials and components.  In addition, where suppliers have exited certain lines of business or closed facilities due to the economic downturn or other reasons, we generally experience additional costs associated with transitioning to new suppliers.  Each of these factors could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
    15 

    Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)                                                                                                         

   Work stoppages at Ford or supplier facilities or other limitations on production (whether as a result of labor disputes, natural or man-made disasters, tight credit markets or other financial distress, production constraints or difficulties, or other factors).    A work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at Ford or supplier facilities for any number of reasons, including as a result of disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements, or as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints or difficulties, or for other reasons.  Recent examples of situations that have affected industry production to varying degrees include:  supplier financial distress due to reduced production volumes during the economic downturn in 2008 2009; capacity constraints as suppliers that restructured or downsized during the downturn work to satisfy growing industry volumes; short-term constraints on production as consumer preferences shift more fluidly across vehicle segments and features; and the impact on certain suppliers of natural disasters during 2011.  As indicated, a work stoppage or other limitations on production at Ford or supplier facilities for any reason (including but not limited to labor disputes, natural or man-made disasters, tight credit markets or other financial distress, or production constraints or difficulties) could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Single-source supply of components or materials.    Many components used in our vehicles are available only from a single supplier and cannot be re-sourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier (due to long lead times, new contractual commitments that may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the components or materials, etc.).  In addition to the general risks described above regarding interruption of supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to a component.  
    
  Labor or other constraints on Ford s ability to maintain competitive cost structure.    Substantially all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations in the United States and Canada are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements.  We negotiated a four-year agreement with the UAW in 2011, and a four-year agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers Union in 2012.  Although we have negotiated transformational agreements in recent years, these agreements provide guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the contract term and some degree of employment security, subject to certain conditions.  As a practical matter, these agreements may restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses.      A substantial number of our employees in other regions are represented by unions or government councils, and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other employment in the state, country, or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or other facilities.   
    
  Substantial pension and postretirement health care and life insurance liabilities impairing liquidity or financial condition.    We have defined benefit retirement plans in the United States that cover many of our hourly and salaried employees.  We also provide pension benefits to non-U.S. employees and retirees, primarily in Europe.  In addition, we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor plans to provide other postretirement benefits ( OPEB ) for retired employees (primarily health care and life insurance benefits).  See Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information about these plans.  These benefit plans impose significant liabilities on us that are not fully funded and will require additional cash contributions, which could impair our liquidity. 
    
  Our qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans are subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ).  Under Title IV of ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( PBGC ) has the authority under certain circumstances or upon the occurrence of certain events to terminate a qualified underfunded pension plan.  One such circumstance is the occurrence of an event that unreasonably increases the risk of unreasonably large losses to the PBGC.  Although we believe it is unlikely that the PBGC would terminate any of our plans, in the event that our qualified U.S. pension plans were terminated at a time when the liabilities of the plans exceeded the assets of the plans, we would incur a liability to the PBGC that could be equal to the entire amount of the underfunding. 
    
  If our cash flows and capital resources were insufficient to fund our pension or OPEB obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, suspend dividend payments, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.  
    
    16 

    Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)                                                                                                         

   Worse-than-assumed economic and demographic experience for postretirement benefit plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns).    The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our postretirement benefit plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants.  We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates, including assumptions related to discount rates, investment returns on designated plan assets, and demographic experience (e.g., mortality and retirement rates).  To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, there could be a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  For discussion of our assumptions, see  Critical Accounting Estimates  in Item 7 and Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. 
    
  Restriction on use of tax attributes from tax law  ownership change.     Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its tax attributes, including net operating losses and tax credits ( Tax Attributes ).  At December 31, 2014, we had Tax Attributes that would offset more than $15 billion of taxable income.  For these purposes, an ownership change occurs if 5 percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.  In 2012, we renewed for an additional three-year period our tax benefit preservation plan (the  Plan ) to reduce the risk of an ownership change under Section 382.  Under the Plan, shares held by any person who acquires, without the approval of our Board of Directors, beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of our outstanding Common Stock could be subject to significant dilution.  Our shareholders approved the renewal at our annual meeting in May 2013. 
    
  The discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs.    Meeting or exceeding many government-mandated safety standards is costly and often technologically challenging, especially where standards may be in tension with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet government-mandated emissions and fuel-economy standards.  Government safety standards also require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard.  In addition, the introduction of new and innovative features and technology to our vehicles could increase the risk of defects or customer dissatisfaction.  In 2014, there was an unprecedented increase in both the number of safety recalls by manufacturers in the United States and vehicles involved in those recalls due, in part, to significant public and governmental attention on the recall process at one of our domestic competitors and NHTSA s expanded definition of safety defects.  In addition, NHTSA s enforcement strategy shifted to a significant increase in civil penalties levied and the use of consent orders requiring direct oversight by NHTSA of certain manufacturers  safety processes, a trend that could continue.  Should we or government safety regulators determine that a safety or other defect or a noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles prior to the start of production, the launch of such vehicle could be delayed until such defect is remedied.  The costs associated with any protracted delay in new model launches necessary to remedy such defects, or the cost of recall campaigns or warranty costs to remedy such defects in vehicles that have been sold, could be substantial.  These recall and warranty costs could be exacerbated to the extent they relate to global platforms.  Furthermore, launch delays or recall actions also could adversely affect our reputation or market acceptance of our products as discussed above under    Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of Ford s new or existing products  .  
    
  Increased safety, emissions, fuel economy, or other regulations resulting in higher costs, cash expenditures, and/or sales restrictions.    The worldwide automotive industry is governed by a substantial amount of government regulation, which often differs by state, region, and country.  Government regulation has arisen, and proposals for additional regulation are advanced, primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about the possibility of global climate change and its impact), vehicle safety, and energy independence.  For example, as discussed above under  Item 1. Business - Governmental Standards,  in the United States the CAFE  standards for light duty vehicles are 35.5 mpg by the 2016 model year, 45 mpg by the 2021 model year, and 54.5 mpg by the 2025 model year; EPA s parallel CO   2    emission regulations impose similar standards.  California s ZEV rules also mandate steep increases in the sale of electric vehicles and other advanced technology vehicles beginning in the 2018 model year.  In addition, many governments regulate local product content and/or impose import requirements as a means of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, and influencing the balance of payments.   
    
    17 

    Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)                                                                                                         

   In recent years, we have made significant changes to our product cycle plan to improve the overall fuel economy of vehicles we produce, thereby reducing their GHG emissions.  There are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, however, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies, consumer acceptance of new technologies and changes in vehicle mix, willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies, the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles, the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new technologies, and the human, engineering, and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time.  The current fuel economy, CO   2   , and ZEV standards will be difficult to meet if fuel prices remain relatively low and market conditions do not drive consumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuel-efficient vehicles in large numbers.  The cost to comply with existing government regulations is substantial, and future, additional regulations or changes in consumer preferences that affect vehicle mix could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  For more discussion of the impact of such standards on our global business, see the  Governmental Standards  discussion in  Item 1. Business  ( Item 1 ) above.  In addition, a number of governments, as well as non-governmental organizations, publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols.  The protocols could change aggressively, and any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicles subjected to such tests could reduce future sales. 
    
  Unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise.    We spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with governmental safety regulations, mobile and stationary source emissions regulations, and other standards.  Compliance with governmental standards, however, does not necessarily prevent individual or class actions, which can entail significant cost and risk.  In certain circumstances, courts may permit tort claims even where our vehicles comply with federal and/or other applicable law.  Furthermore, simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards, whether related to our products or business or commercial relationships, may require significant expenditures of time and other resources.  Litigation also is inherently uncertain, and we could experience significant adverse results.  In addition, adverse publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could have a significant adverse effect on our sales. 
    
  A change in requirements under long-term supply arrangements committing Ford to purchase minimum or fixed quantities of certain parts, or to pay a minimum amount to the seller ( take-or-pay  contracts).    We have entered into a number of long-term supply contracts that require us to purchase a fixed quantity of parts to be used in the production of our vehicles.  If our need for any of these parts were to lessen, we could still be required to purchase a specified quantity of the part or pay a minimum amount to the seller pursuant to the take-or-pay contract, which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Adverse effects on results from a decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentives related to investments.    We receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production.  These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, and tax abatements or credits.  The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period.  For example, most of our manufacturing facilities in South America are located in Brazil, where the state or federal governments have historically offered, and continue to offer, significant incentives to manufacturers to encourage capital investment, increase manufacturing production, and create jobs.  As a result, the performance of our South American operations has been impacted favorably by government incentives to a substantial extent as we have increased our investment and manufacturing presence in Brazil, and we expect this favorable impact to continue for the next several years.  In Brazil, the federal government has levied assessments against us concerning our calculation of federal incentives we received, and certain states have challenged the grant to us of tax incentives by the state of Bahia, including a constitutional challenge of state incentives that is pending in Brazil s Supreme Court.  A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting for government incentives, and  Item 3. Legal Proceedings  for discussion of tax proceedings in Brazil. 
    
  Inherent limitations of internal controls impacting financial statements and safeguarding of assets.    Our internal control over financial reporting and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect misstatements or loss of assets because of  inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement accuracy and safeguarding of assets.

    Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)                                                                                                         

   Cybersecurity risks to operational systems, security systems, or infrastructure owned by Ford, Ford Credit, or a third-party vendor or supplier.    We are at risk for interruptions, outages, and breaches of: (i) operational systems (including business, financial, accounting, product development, consumer receivables, data processing, or manufacturing processes); (ii) facility security systems; and/or (iii) in-vehicle systems or mobile devices.  Such cyber incidents could materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information of customers, employees, or others; jeopardize the security of our facilities; and/or affect the performance of in-vehicle systems.  A cyber incident could be caused by malicious third parties using sophisticated, targeted methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption, and other security defenses, including hacking, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception.  The techniques used by third parties change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time.  A significant cyber incident could harm our reputation and subject us to regulatory actions or litigation.     
    
  Failure of financial institutions to fulfill commitments under committed credit and liquidity facilities.    Under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2014 and as further amended (the  revolving credit facility ), we are able to borrow, repay, and then re-borrow up to $12.2 billion.  Certain of our subsidiaries have standby or revolving credit facilities on which they depend for liquidity.  If the financial institutions that provide these or other committed credit facilities were to default on their obligation to fund the commitments, these facilities would not be available to us, which could substantially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.  For discussion of our Credit Agreement, see  Liquidity and Capital Resources  in Item 7 and Note 13 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. 
    
  Inability of Ford Credit to access debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts, due to credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors.     Ford Credit s ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost is dependent on its credit ratings or its perceived creditworthiness.  Ford Credit s ability to obtain securitized funding under its committed asset-backed liquidity programs and certain other asset-backed securitization transactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs, as well as Ford Credit s ability to obtain appropriate credit ratings and, for certain committed programs, derivatives to manage the interest rate risk.  Over time, and particularly in the event of any credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints.  In addition, Ford Credit may be limited in the amount of receivables it purchases or originates in certain countries or regions if the local capital markets, particularly in developing countries, do not exist or are not adequately developed.  Similarly, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there is a significant decline in the demand for the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its securitization transactions.  A significant reduction in the amount of receivables Ford Credit purchases or originates would significantly reduce its ongoing profits and could adversely affect its ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles. 
    
  Higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles.      Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer s or dealer s failure to make payments according to contract terms.  Credit risk (which is heavily dependent upon economic factors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, dealer profitability, and used car prices) has a significant impact on Ford Credit s business.  The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, Ford Credit projects expected residual values (including residual value support payments from Ford) and return volumes for the vehicles it leases.  Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected, which would reduce the profitability of the lease transaction.  Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume of vehicles returned, economic conditions, and quality or perceived quality, safety, fuel efficiency, or reliability of the vehicles.  Actual return volumes may be higher than expected and can be influenced by contractual lease-end values relative to auction values, marketing programs for new vehicles, and general economic conditions.  Each of these factors, alone or in combination, has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credit s profitability if actual results were to differ significantly from Ford Credit s projections.  See  Critical Accounting Estimates  in Item 7 for additional discussion.

    Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)                                                                                                         

   Increased competition from banks, financial institutions, or other third parties seeking to increase their share of financing Ford vehicles.    No single company is a dominant force in the automotive finance industry.  Most of Ford Credit s bank competitors in the United States use credit aggregation systems that permit dealers to send, through standardized systems, retail credit applications to multiple finance sources to evaluate financing options offered by these sources.  Also, direct on-line or large dealer group financing options provide consumers with alternative finance sources and/or increased pricing transparency.  All of these financing alternatives drive greater competition based on financing rates.  Competition from such institutions and alternative finance sources could adversely affect Ford Credit s profitability and the volume of its retail business.  In addition, Ford Credit may face increased competition on wholesale financing for Ford dealers. 
    
  New or increased credit, consumer, or data protection or other regulations resulting in higher costs and/or additional financing restrictions.      As a finance company, Ford Credit is highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations in which it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business.  In the United States, for example, Ford Credit s operations are subject to regulation, supervision, and licensing under various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Fair Credit Reporting Act.   
    
  Congress also passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Protection Act ( Act ) in 2010 to reform practices in the financial services industries, including automotive financing and securitizations.  The Act directs federal agencies to adopt rules to regulate the consumer finance industry and the capital markets and, among other things, gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) broad rule-making and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer finance protection laws that regulate consumer finance businesses, such as Ford Credit s retail automotive financing business.  Exercise of these powers by the CFPB may increase the costs of, impose additional restrictions on, or otherwise adversely affect companies in the automotive finance business.  For example, in March 2013, the CFPB issued a bulletin recommending that indirect vehicle lenders, a class that includes Ford Credit, take steps to monitor and/or impose controls over dealer discretionary pricing.  In September 2014, the CFPB issued a  
  proposed rule for the supervision of the largest nonbank automotive finance companies, such as Ford Credit.  This is the initial step that is expected to lead to examinations of nonbank automotive finance companies for compliance with consumer finance protection laws as early as 2015.   
    
  In addition, the Act provides that a non-bank financial company could be designated a  systemically important financial institution  by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and thus be subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  Such a designation would mean that a non-bank finance company such as Ford Credit, in effect, could be regulated like a bank with respect to capital and other requirements, but without the benefits of being a bank such as the ability to offer Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insured deposits. 
    
  The Act also creates an alternative liquidation framework under which the FDIC may be appointed as receiver of a non-bank financial company if the U.S. Treasury Secretary (in consultation with the President of the United States) determines that the company is in default or danger of default and the resolution of the company under other applicable law (e.g., U.S. bankruptcy law) would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States.  The FDIC s powers under this framework may vary from those of a bankruptcy court under U.S. bankruptcy law, which could adversely impact securitization markets, including Ford Credit s funding activities, regardless of whether Ford Credit ever is determined to be subject to the Act s alternative liquidation framework.   
    
  In some countries outside the United States, some of Ford Credit s subsidiaries are regulated banking institutions and are required, among other things, to maintain minimum capital reserves.  In many other locations, governmental authorities require companies to have licenses in order to conduct financing businesses.  Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes additional costs on Ford Credit and affects the conduct of its business.  Additional regulation could add significant cost or operational constraints that might impair Ford Credit s profitability.

ITEM 2.   Properties. 
    
    Our principal properties include manufacturing and assembly facilities, distribution centers, warehouses, sales or administrative offices, and engineering centers. 
    
  We own substantially all of our U.S. manufacturing and assembly facilities.  Our facilities are situated in various sections of the country and include assembly plants, engine plants, casting plants, metal stamping plants, transmission plants, and other component plants.  About half of our distribution centers are leased (we own approximately 51% of the total square footage, and lease the balance).  A substantial amount of our warehousing is provided by third-party providers under service contracts.  Because the facilities provided pursuant to third-party service contracts need not be dedicated exclusively or even primarily to our use, these spaces are not included in the number of distribution centers/warehouses listed in the table below.  The majority of the warehouses that we operate are leased, although many of our manufacturing and assembly facilities contain some warehousing space.  Substantially all of our sales offices are leased space.  Approximately 98% of the total square footage of our engineering centers and our supplementary research and development space is owned by us.   
    
  In addition, we maintain and operate manufacturing plants, assembly facilities, parts distribution centers, and engineering centers outside of the United States.  We own substantially all of our non-U.S. manufacturing plants, assembly facilities, and engineering centers.  The majority of our parts distribution centers outside of the United States are either leased or provided by vendors under service contracts.  
    
  We and the entities that we consolidated as of December 31, 2014 use eight regional engineering, research, and development centers, and 62 manufacturing plants as shown in the table below: 

Included in the number of plants shown above are plants that are operated by us or our consolidated joint ventures that support our Automotive sector.  The significant consolidated joint ventures and the number of plants each owns are as follows: 

Ford Lio Ho Motor Company Ltd. ( FLH )     a joint venture in Taiwan among Ford (70% partner), the Lio Ho Group (25% partner), and individual shareholders (5% ownership in aggregate) that assembles a variety of Ford and Mazda vehicles sourced from Ford as well as Mazda.  In addition to domestic assembly, FLH also has local product development capability to modify component parts for local needs, and imports Ford brand built-up vehicles from the Asia Pacific Africa region, Europe, and the United States.  The joint venture operates one plant in Taiwan. 

Ford Vietnam Limited     a joint venture between Ford (75% partner) and Diesel Song Cong One Member Limited Liability Company (a subsidiary of the Vietnam Engine and Agricultural Machinery Corporation, which in turn is owned by the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade)(25% partner).

   ITEM 3.   Legal Proceedings. 
    
    The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual litigated matters is not predictable with assurance.  See Note 27 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of loss contingencies.  Following is a discussion of our significant pending legal proceedings: 
    
  PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS 
    
  We are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts within and outside of the United States alleging damages from injuries resulting from (or aggravated by) alleged defects in our vehicles.  In many, no dollar amount of damages is specified, or the specific amount alleged is the jurisdictional minimum.  Our experience with litigation alleging a specific amount of damages suggests that such amounts, on average, bear little relation to the actual amount of damages, if any, that we will pay in resolving such matters. 
    
  In addition to pending actions, we assess the likelihood of incidents that likely have occurred but not yet been reported to us; we also take into consideration specific matters that have been raised as claims but have not yet proceeded to litigation.  Individual product liability matters which, if resolved unfavorably to the Company, likely would involve a significant cost would be described herein.  Currently there are no such matters to report.   
    
  ASBESTOS MATTERS  
    
  Asbestos was used in some brakes, clutches, and other automotive components from the early 1900s.  Along with other vehicle manufacturers, we have been the target of asbestos litigation and, as a result, are a defendant in various actions for injuries claimed to have resulted from alleged exposure to Ford parts and other products containing asbestos.  Plaintiffs in these personal injury cases allege various health problems as a result of asbestos exposure, either from component parts found in older vehicles, insulation or other asbestos products in our facilities, or asbestos aboard our former maritime fleet.  We believe that we are being targeted more aggressively in asbestos suits because many previously-targeted companies have filed for bankruptcy, or emerged from bankruptcy relieved of liability for such claims.    
    
  Most of the asbestos litigation we face involves individuals who claim to have worked on the brakes of our vehicles over the years.  We are prepared to defend these cases, and believe that the scientific evidence confirms our long-standing position that there is no increased risk of asbestos-related disease as a result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the brakes on our vehicles.  The extent of our financial exposure to asbestos litigation remains very difficult to estimate and could include both compensatory and punitive damage awards.  The majority of our asbestos cases do not specify a dollar amount for damages; in many of the other cases the dollar amount specified is the jurisdictional minimum, and the vast majority of these cases involve multiple defendants, sometimes more than one hundred.  Many of these cases also involve multiple plaintiffs, and often we are unable to tell from the pleadings which plaintiffs are making claims against us (as opposed to other defendants).  Annual payout and defense costs may become significant in the future. 
    
  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  
    
  We have received notices under various federal and state environmental laws that we (along with others) are or may be a potentially responsible party for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage, recycling, or disposal sites in many states and, in some instances, for natural resource damages.  We also may have been a generator of hazardous substances at a number of other sites.  The amount of any such costs or damages for which we may be held responsible could be significant.  At this time, we have no individual environmental legal proceedings to which a governmental authority is a party and in which we believe there is the possibility of monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000.

    Item 3. Legal Proceedings (Continued)                                                                                                 

   CLASS ACTIONS  
    
  In light of the fact that very few of the purported class actions filed against us in the past have ever been certified by the courts as class actions, in general we list below those actions that (i) have been certified as a class action by a court of competent jurisdiction (and any additional purported class actions that raise allegations substantially similar to an existing and certified class), and (ii) likely would involve a significant cost if resolved unfavorably to the Company.   
    
  Medium/Heavy Truck Sales Procedure Class Action.    This action pending in the Ohio state court system alleges that Ford breached its Sales and Service Agreement with Ford truck dealers by failing to publish to all Ford dealers all price concessions that were approved for any dealer.  The trial court certified a nationwide class consisting of all Ford dealers who purchased from Ford any 600-series or higher truck from 1987 to 1997, and granted plaintiffs  motion for summary judgment on liability.  During 2011, a jury awarded $4.5 million in damages to the named plaintiff dealer and the trial court applied the jury s findings with regard to the named plaintiff to all dealers in the class, entering a judgment of approximately $2 billion in damages.  We appealed, and on May 3, 2012, the Ohio Court of Appeals reversed the trial court s grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs, vacated the damages award, and remanded the matter for a new trial.  The retrial in Septe  mber 2013 resulted in a verdict in Ford s favor.  On February 7, 2014, the trial court granted plaintiffs  motion for a new trial, but     on December 11, 2014, the Ohio Court of Appeals reversed the order granting a new trial and reinstated the verdict in Ford s favor.  Plaintiffs have   sought further review in the   Ohio Supreme Court.  
    
  OTHER MATTERS 
  Brazilian Tax Matters.    Three Brazilian states and the Brazilian federal tax authority have levied substantial tax assessments against Ford Brazil related to state and federal tax incentives Ford Brazil receives for its operations in the Brazilian state of Bahia.  All assessments have been appealed to the relevant administrative court of each jurisdiction.  For each assessment, if we do not prevail at the administrative level, we plan to appeal to the relevant state or federal judicial court, which would likely require us to post significant collateral in order to proceed.  Our appeals with one state and the federal tax authority remain at the administrative level.  In the other two states, where three cases are pending, we have appealed to the judicial court and to date we have not been required to post collateral.  
    
  Transit Connect Customs Ruling.    On March 8, 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) ruled that Transit Connects imported as passenger wagons and later converted into cargo vans are subject to the 25% duty applicable to cargo vehicles, rather than the 2.5% duty applicable to passenger vehicles.  As a result of the ruling, CBP (1) is requiring Ford to pay the 25% duty upon importation of Transit Connects that will be converted to cargo vehicles, and (2) is seeking the difference in duty rates for prior imports.  Our protest of the ruling within CBP was denied and we filed a challenge in the U.S. Court of International Trade ( CIT ).   A decision by CIT may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  If we prevail, we will receive a refund of the contested amounts paid, plus interest.  If we do not prevail, CBP would recover the increased duties for prior imports, plus interest, and might assert a claim for penalties.

    ITEM 5.    Market for Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
    
  Our Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the United States, and on certain stock exchanges in Belgium and France. 
    
  The table below shows the high and low sales prices for our Common Stock, and the dividends we paid per share of Common and Class B Stock, for each quarterly period in 2013 and 2014: 

__________

    New York Stock Exchange composite intraday prices as listed in the price history database available at www.NYSEnet.com. 
       
  As of February 6, 2015, stockholders of record of Ford included approximately 137,803 holders of Common Stock and 36 holders of Class B Stock.   
    
  In May 2014 we commenced and in August 2014 we completed a repurchase program for approximately 116 million shares of Ford Common Stock, or 3% of diluted shares, at a total cost of about $2 billion.  Approximately 12.6 million shares were repurchased to offset the dilutive effect of share-based employee incentive compensation granted in 2014.  Approximately 103 million shares were repurchased to offset the dilutive effect of our 4.25% Senior Convertible Notes due November 15, 2016, as well as to offset the increase in outstanding shares that would result from settling conversions with shares.  On October 21, 2014, we announced our election to terminate holders  conversion rights in accordance with the terms of the convertible notes, effective November 20, 2014.  Until November 19, 2014, holders had the right to convert their notes and almost all of the total $882 million principal amount of convertible notes that were outstanding was converted.  Approximately 103 million shares of Ford Common Stock were issued by us to settle the conversions.

ITEM 6.   Selected Financial Data. 
    
  On January 1, 2014, we changed our accounting method for determining the obligation for long-term disability benefits (see Note   1  ).  We have applied the change in accounting method retrospectively to periods covered in this Report, and the amounts below reflect this change.  The following table sets forth selected financial data for each of the last five years (dollar amounts in millions, except for per share amounts):

      ITEM 7.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
    OVERVIEW    
    
  Revenue 
    
  Our Automotive sector s revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories; we generally treat sales and marketing incentives as a reduction to revenue.  Revenue is recorded when all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors).  For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities.  This is not the case, however, with respect to vehicles produced for sale to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option.  These vehicles are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue and profits recognized over the term of the lease.  When we sell the returned vehicle at auction, we recognize a gain or loss on the difference, if any, between actual auction value and the projected auction value.  
    
  Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit.  Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant legal entity in our Automotive sector in payment of the dealer s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle.  The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer. 
    
  Our Financial Services sector s revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables, net of certain deferred origination costs that are included as a reduction of financing revenue, and such revenue is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method.  Also, revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  Income is generated to the extent revenues exceed expenses, most of which are interest, depreciation, and operating expenses. 
    
  Transactions between our Automotive and Financial Services sectors occur in the ordinary course of business.  For example, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers  customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit.  The estimated cost for these incentives is recorded as revenue reduction to   Automotive sales   at the later of the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded or the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated.  In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease rates offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer s customer.  Ford Credit recognizes the amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation.  See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions and payments between our Automotive and Financial Services sectors.   
    
  Costs and Expenses 
    
  Our income statement classifies our Automotive total costs and expenses into two categories:  (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses.  We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, manufacture, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, and accessories.  Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following:  material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall and customer satisfaction program costs; labor and other costs related to the development and manufacture of our products; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs.  We include within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and manufacture of our products, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs.   
    
  Certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production.  In our industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.  Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons, and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches).  As we have seen in recent years, annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel.   
    
    28 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   As a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels.  We analyze these cost changes in the following categories:   

Material excluding commodity costs - primarily reflecting the change in cost of purchased parts used in the assembly of our vehicles.   
                
    Commodity costs - reflecting the change in cost for raw materials (such as steel, aluminum, and resins) used in the manufacture of our products.   
                
    Structural costs - reflecting the change in costs that generally do not have a directly proportionate relationship to our production volumes, such as labor costs, including pension and health care; other costs related to the development and manufacture of our vehicles; depreciation and amortization; and advertising and sales promotion costs.  
                
    Warranty and other costs - reflecting the change in cost related to warranty coverage, field service actions, and customer satisfaction actions, as well as the change in freight and other costs related to the distribution of our vehicles and support for the sale and distribution of parts and accessories.   
       
  While material (including commodity), freight, and warranty costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume.  We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs.  For example, depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions.  On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase overtime, add a production shift or add personnel to support volume increases.  Other structural costs, such as advertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume.  Our structural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors.    
    
  We consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue.  For example, increases in structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability as we expand around the world, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing industry sales volume, and grow our market share.  
    
  Automotive total costs and expenses for full-year 2014 was $133.8 billion.  Material costs (including commodity costs) make up the largest portion of our Automotive total costs and expenses, representing in 2014 about two-thirds of the total amount.  Of the remaining balance of our Automotive costs and expenses, the largest piece is structural costs.  Although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs. 
    
  Key Economic Factors and Trends Affecting the Automotive Industry 
    
  Currency Exchange Rate Volatility.    The U.S. Federal Reserve has ended financial asset purchases, and the resulting shifts in capital flows have contributed to downward pressure on several emerging market currencies.  In some cases that pressure is aggravated by high inflation, unstable policy environments, or both.   Additionally, the yen and euro have depreciated as a result of policy changes by the Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank.  The weak yen, in particular,  adds significant potential downward pressure on vehicle pricing across many markets globally.  In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile.  However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments. 
    
  Excess Capacity.    According to IHS Automotive, an automotive research firm, the estimated automotive industry global production capacity for light vehicles of about 116 million units exceeded global production by about 29 million units in 2014.  In North America and Europe, two regions where a significant share of industry revenue is earned, excess capacity as a percent of production in 2014 was an estimated 7% and 30%, respectively.  In China, the auto industry also witnessed excess capacity at 45% of production in 2014, as manufacturers competed to capitalize on China s future market potential.  According to production capacity data projected by IHS Automotive, global excess capacity conditions could continue for several years at an average of about 32 million units per year during the period from 2015 to 2019. 
    
  Pricing Pressure.    Excess capacity, coupled with a proliferation of new products being introduced in key segments, will keep pressure on manufacturers  ability to increase prices.  In North America, the industry restructuring of the past few years has allowed manufacturers to better match production with demand, although Japanese and Korean manufacturers also have capacity located outside of the region directed to North America.  In the future, Chinese and Indian manufacturers are expected to enter U.S. and European markets, further intensifying competition.  Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity will continue to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly- 
    29 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   contented vehicles in the United States and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry.  In Europe, the excess capacity situation was exacerbated by weakening demand and the lack of reductions in existing capacity, such that negative pricing pressure is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. 
    
  Commodity and Energy Price Changes.    The price of oil fell sharply in the second half of 2014, to below $50 per barrel, as demand was weaker than anticipated and global supply remained strong.  Other commodity prices also have declined recently, but over the longer term prices are likely to trend higher given expectations for global demand growth.  
    
  Vehicle Profitability.    Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line.  In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle segments.  For example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was about 140% of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins.  Government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to the consumer.  Given the backdrop of excess capacity, these regulations could dampen contribution margins.  As we execute our One Ford plan, we are working to create best-in-class vehicles on global platforms that contribute higher margins, and offering a more balanced portfolio of vehicles with which we aim to be among the leaders in fuel efficiency in every segment in which we compete.    
    
  Increasing Sales of Smaller Vehicles  .  Like other manufacturers, we are increasing our participation in newly-developed and emerging markets, such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China, in which vehicle sales are expected to increase at a faster rate than in most mature markets.  The largest segments in these markets are small vehicles (i.e., Sub-B, B, and C segments).  To increase our participation in these fast-growing markets, we are significantly increasing our production capacity, directly or through joint ventures.  Although we expect positive contribution margins from higher small vehicle sales, one result of increased production of small vehicles may be that, over time, our average per unit margin decreases because small vehicles tend to have lower margins than medium and large vehicles.  
    
  Trade Policy.    To the extent governments in various regions erect or intensify barriers to imports, or implement currency policy that advantages local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in markets that promote free trade.  While we believe the long-term trend is toward the growth of free trade, we have noted with concern recent developments in a number of regions.  In Asia Pacific Africa, for example, the recent dramatic depreciation of the yen significantly reduces the cost of exports into the United States, Europe, and other global markets by Japanese manufacturers.  Over a period of time, the emerging weakness of the yen can contribute to other countries pursuing weak currency policies by intervening in the exchange rate markets.  This is particularly likely in other Asian countries, such as South Korea.  As another example, government actions in South America to incentivize local production and balance trade are driving trade frictions between South American countries and also with Mexico, resulting in business environment instability and new trade barriers.  We will continue to monitor and address developing issues around trade policy.   
    
  Other Economic Factors.    During 2014, mature market government bond yields and inflation were lower than expected, and there is a rising risk of persistent disinflation and, in some markets, even outright deflation.  The lower  levels of inflation and interest rates were unexpected partially because they have occurred against a backdrop of loose monetary policy and high levels of mature market deficits and debt.  The eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, with potentially higher long-term interest rates, may still drive a higher cost of capital over our planning period.  Higher interest rates and/or taxes to address the higher deficits also may impede real growth in gross domestic product and, therefore, vehicle sales over our planning period.

   Trends and Strategies  
    
  Our priorities are: (1) accelerate the pace of progress of our One Ford plan, (2) deliver product excellence with passion, and (3) drive innovation in every part of our business.   

Accelerate the Pace of Progress of Our One Ford Plan 
    
  Our first priority is to accelerate the pace of progress of our One Ford plan.  The One Ford plan has been fundamental to the progress we have made in recent years, and it is fundamental to our performance going forward.  In many ways we are starting to see the full benefits and strength of the One Ford plan, and we see an opportunity to accelerate our pace of progress to drive operational excellence and profitable growth for all. 
    
    31 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Deliver Product Excellence with Passion 
    
  Our second priority is to deliver product excellence with passion.  Products are the lifeblood of our business and our One Ford plan has allowed us to field the best product line-up we have ever had and one of the freshest.   
  
  In 2014, we launched 24 all-new or significantly refreshed products globally, including the all-new F-150, Mustang, Escort, Ka, Transit, and Lincoln MKC.  Our momentum will continue in 2015 with 15 new global product launches.   
    
  Our strategy is to serve customers in all markets with a full family of best in class vehicles small, medium and large; cars, utilities and trucks; each delivering the highest quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart design, and value and delivering profitable growth for all.   
    
  The fundamentals of our global product plan have not changed.  Our vision is to produce vehicles that: 

Have bold, emotive exterior designs 
        Are great to drive 
             
    Are great to sit in (second home comfort, convenience, exceptional quietness) 
        Provide fuel economy as a reason to buy 
     Are instantly recognizable in look, sound, and feel 
     Provide exceptional value and quality 
    
    32 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Our One Ford global product development process utilizes global platforms to deliver customer-focused programs rapidly and efficiently across global markets.  We continue to make progress on our commitment to consolidate platforms.  

We now have 12 global platforms, and we are on track to have nine global platforms in 2016, with almost 100% of our global vehicle volume coming off the nine global platforms.  We are able to reinvest the savings resulting from of our platform consolidation back into product development to introduce more products at a faster product cadence; our cumulative refresh rate for the 2015 to 2019 period is expected to be the best in the industry.  Over 50% of our global volume in 2015 will be from vehicles launched in 2014 and 2015.  These launches help set up our next stage of growth, and this will drive revenue and profit growth.   
    
  We have made substantial progress recently with the quality of our vehicles.  Our latest  Things Gone Wrong  data shows that our quality is back on track in North America and South America, and is at best-ever levels in Europe and Asia Pacific.  Areas such as infotainment, transmissions, and interiors have shown significant improvement as a result of focusing our effort to close the gap versus industry averages.  We also are working to improve our Global Product Development System to ensure the process improvements we make flow through to more robust launches, less downstream changes, improved timing, and eventually further improve our quality.  As a result of these efforts and the migration to our high quality global platforms, customer satisfaction is trending up across all regions.  
    
    33 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Drive Innovation in Every Part of Our Business 
  Our third priority is to drive innovation in every part of our business.  Our industry is rapidly evolving, and new technology is having a significant impact on our business.  
  
  We are a technology leader providing innovations consumers demand today while developing affordable, accessible solutions to help meet the needs of future transportation.  Our approach to innovation is to employ an  Innovation Mindset   by asking questions, challenging customs, and taking intelligent risks all across the Company, in every part of the business.  Innovation is driven by individuals and teams that find new ways to approach existing problems in a quest to make the world a better place.  
    34 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

We are always looking ahead and developing affordable, accessible solutions to help meet the needs of future transportation.  Our Blueprint for Mobility, announced in 2012, set near-, mid- and long-term goals for solutions to the challenges facing mobility systems now and in the future as the world becomes more populated and urbanized.  It highlights our thinking about what transportation will look like in 2025 and beyond, and identifies the types of technologies, business models, products, and partnerships needed to get us there. 
    
  In the near-term, we are bringing together partners and communities to think beyond the vehicles.  We are researching technology and using human ingenuity to locate open parking spaces in crowded cities; make car-sharing easier; move vehicles across cities with remote control; use vehicles and bicycles to gather information about traffic and parking conditions; and even help make health care more accessible in rural areas.  In the mid-term, we are targeting additional semi-autonomous driving technologies and the emergence of integrated networks.  In the long-term, the landscape could look radically different.  Connected traffic networks and smart vehicles capable of automated navigation are likely to bring about new business models and contribute to improved personal mobility.   
    
  We are advancing the development of semi-autonomous technologies that have the potential to make driving safer, provide a more convenient driving experience, and ease traffic congestion.  We are already manufacturing and selling vehicles with driver-assist technologies, such as: 
    
  Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Detection     uses a camera and radar to help reduce the severity of, or even eliminate, some frontal collisions involving vehicles and pedestrians.  The pre-collision assist helps drivers avoid frontal collisions with other vehicles at all speeds, while   Pedestrian Detection   helps drivers avoid pedestrians at lower speeds.  
    
  Active Park Assist     uses ultrasonic sensors and electric power-assisted steering to help drivers parallel park.  The sensors measure the gap between two vehicles to determine if there is enough room for the vehicle.  After confirming the vehicle can fit, the vehicle automatically steers into the space, while the driver operates the accelerator and brake pedals  . 
    
    35 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Adaptive Cruise Control / Collision Warning with Brake Support      uses a radar sensor in the front of the vehicle to measure the distance and speed of vehicles ahead.  Using this information, the vehicle can automatically slow to keep a consistent following distance set by the driver.  The slower speed will be maintained if adaptive cruise control is activated.  Collision warning triggers visual and audio alerts if the system detects the following distance is diminishing too quickly and a collision may occur.  It also pre-charges the brakes if the driver needs to stop suddenly  . 
    
  Lane Keeping     uses a camera to help prevent the driver from drifting outside of the intended driving lane.  The system automatically detects the left- or right- hand road lane markings.  An alert, such as a vibration in the steering wheel  ,   is used to warn the driver.  The system can also provide steering torque to help guide the vehicle back into the lane if needed  . 
    
  Enhanced Active Park Assist     uses ultrasonic sensors to help the driver reverse into a space side-to-side with other cars, and for ease of parking going into and out of parking spaces.  
    
  And we are researching many automated assist technologies, including   Traffic Jam Assist  , a further building block toward automated driving in the future.

   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  TOTAL COMPANY 
    
  Our net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was $3.2 billion or $0.80 per share of Common and Class B Stock in 2014, a decline of $4 billion or $0.97 per share from 2013. 
    
  Total Company results are shown below: 

Net income     includes certain items ( special items ) that we have grouped into  Personnel and Dealer-Related Items  and  Other Items  to provide useful information to investors about the nature of the special items.  The first category includes items related to our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix and therefore helps investors track amounts related to those activities.  The second category includes items that we do not generally consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating activities, and therefore allows investors analyzing our pre-tax results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. 
    
  As detailed in Note 24 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, we allocate special items to a separate reconciling item, as opposed to allocating them among the operating segments and Other Automotive, reflecting the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources among the segments.   
       
  The following table details Automotive sector pre-tax special items in each category: 

__________ 
           (a) 
    For 2014 and 2013, primarily related to separation costs for personnel at the Genk and U.K. facilities. 
       
    37 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Not shown in the table above are tax benefits of $494 million, $2.2 billion, and $315 million for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, that we consider to be special items.  For 2013, these included the impact of a favorable increase in deferred tax assets related to investments in our European operations and the release of valuation allowances held against U.S. state and local deferred tax assets.  
  Discussion of Automotive sector, Financial Services sector, and total Company results of operations below is on a pre-tax basis and excludes special items unless otherwise specifically noted.  References to records by Automotive segments North America, South America, Europe, Middle East   Africa, and Asia Pacific are since at least 2000 when we began reporting specific business unit results. 
    
  The chart below shows 2014 pre-tax results by sector: 

Both the Automotive and Financial Services sectors contributed to the Company s 2014 pre-tax profit of $6.3 billion.   The decline in profit, compared with 2013, was more than explained by Automotive sector results.   
    38 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR  
    
  In general, we measure year-over-year change in Automotive pre-tax operating profit for our total Automotive sector and reportable segments using the causal factors listed below, with revenue and cost variances calculated at present-year volume and mix and exchange: 

Market Factors  : 
                
    Volume and Mix -   primarily measures profit variance from changes in wholesale volumes (at prior-year average margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the profit variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line 
                
    Net Pricing -    primarily measures profit variance driven by changes in wholesale prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, and special lease offers 

Contribution Costs -   primarily measures profit variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs 

Other Costs -   primarily measures profit variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume.  These include mainly structural costs, described below, as well as all other costs, which include items such as litigation costs and costs related to our after-market parts, accessories, and service business.  Structural costs include the following cost categories:  
                
    Manufacturing and Engineering -   consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing- and engineering-related personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), new product launch expense, prototype materials, and outside engineering services  
                
    Spending-Related -   consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases   
                
    Advertising and Sales Promotions -   includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows  
                
    Administrative and Selling -   includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities and selling functions, as well as associated information technology costs 
                
    Pension and OPEB -   consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit costs  

Exchange   - Primarily measures profit variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging 

Net Interest and Other  
                
    Net Interest   - primarily measures profit variance driven by changes in our Automotive sector s centrally-managed net interest, which consists of interest expense, interest income, fair market value adjustments on our cash equivalents and marketable securities portfolio (excluding our investment in Mazda), and other adjustments 
                
    Other   - items not included in the causal factors defined above

   2014 Compared with 2013 
    
  Total Automotive.    The following two charts detail the key metrics and the change in 2014 pre-tax results compared with 2013 by causal factor.  Automotive operating margin is defined as Automotive pre-tax results, excluding special items and Other Automotive, divided by Automotive revenue. 

As shown above, full-year wholesale volume was about equal to a year ago.  Automotive sector revenue was lower than a year ago by 3%, more than explained by lower volume from consolidated operations and unfavorable exchange.  Operating margin, at 3.9%, and pre-tax profit, at $4.5 billion, were also lower.   

40 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

Lower pre-tax profit was driven by the Americas; all other business units improved.  Higher costs, including warranty, unfavorable exchange, and lower volume, including product launch effects and supplier parts shortages, more than explain the decline.  Higher net pricing was a partial offset. 
    41 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Total costs and expenses   for our Automotive sector for 2014 and 2013 was $133.8 billion and $135.2 billion, respectively, a difference of $1.4 billion.  An explanation of the change is shown below (in billions): 

_________ 
           (a)   
    Our key cost change elements are measured primarily at present-year exchange; in addition, costs that vary directly with volume, such as material, freight and warranty costs, are measured at present-year volume and mix.  Excludes special items. 
       
  Results by Automotive Segment.    Details by segment of   Income before income taxes   are shown below for 2014. 
  
  In 2014, Automotive pre-tax profit was driven by profits in North America and record results in Asia Pacific.  Middle East   Africa was about breakeven, while Europe and South America incurred large losses as expected.  Other Automotive primarily reflects net interest expense. 
    42 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   North America Segment.    The following two charts detail the key metrics and the change in 2014 pre-tax results compared with 2013 by causal factor.  
  
  North America continued to benefit from robust industry sales, our strong product line-up, continued discipline in matching production to demand, and a lean cost structure. 
    
  As shown above, North America s full-year wholesale volume and revenue both declined 5% compared with 2013.  Operating margin was 8.4%, 1.8 percentage points lower than a year ago, while pre-tax profit was $6.9 billion, down $1.9 billion.   
    
  For the full year, total U.S. market share was down 1 percentage point, primarily reflecting lower F-150 share as we prepared for the all-new vehicle by balancing share with transaction prices and stocks, as well as a planned reduction in daily rental sales.  U.S. retail share of retail industry was down 0.6 percentage points  . 

43 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

The decrease in pre-tax profit for 2014 compared with 2013 is more than explained by lower volume and higher warranty costs, including recalls. 
    
    44 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   South America Segment.    The following two charts detail the key metrics and the change in 2014 pre-tax results compared with 2013 by causal factor.  
  
  In South America, we are continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product line-up, including replacing legacy products with global One Ford offerings.  We also are continuing to manage the effects of slowing GDP growth, lower industry volumes in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, as well as policy uncertainty in some countries.   
    
  As shown above, full-year wholesale volume and revenue deteriorated from a year ago by 14% and 19%, respectively.  Operating margin was negative 13.2%, and the pre-tax loss was $1.2 billion, both deteriorated from a year ago.  The deterioration in all metrics was driven by unfavorable changes in the external factors mentioned above.   
    45 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

The decrease in pre-tax profit for 2014 compared with 2013 is more than explained by unfavorable exchange, higher costs (primarily driven by higher inflation), and lower volume, offset partially by favorable net pricing.  The higher net pricing reflects partial recovery of the adverse effects of high local inflation and weaker local currencies, along with pricing associated with our new products.  The full year loss includes $426 million of adverse balance sheet exchange effects, related primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar in the first quarter.

  The improvement in Europe s 2014 results, as shown above, reflect our continued implementation of our transformation plan focused on product, brand, and cost. 
       
  Europe s full-year wholesale volume and revenue were up 5% and 8%, respectively, from a year ago.  Operating margin was negative 3.6% and the pre-tax loss was $1.1 billion, both improved from a year ago.   
    
  Europe 20 full-year market share, at 8.0%, was up 0.2 percentage points, more than explained by a 1.4 percentage point improvement in our commercial vehicle share, to 11.4%, reflecting the success of our full line of new Transit vehicles and continued strong performance of the Ranger compact pick-up.  For the year, Europe retail share of the retail passenger car industry for the five major markets was 8.2%, unchanged from a year ago.

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

The improvement in pre-tax results is more than explained by higher volume and lower cost, offset partially by Russia and other factors, including lower component pricing and parts and accessories profits.

   Middle East   Africa Segment.    The following chart details the key metrics.  
  
  In Middle East   Africa we are focused on building our distribution capability, expanding our One Ford product offering tailored to the needs of markets in the region, and leveraging global low-cost sourcing hubs for vehicles in this fast growing region. 
       
  Middle East   Africa s full-year wholesale volume and revenue were down 4% and 3%, respectively, from a year ago.  Operating margin was negative 0.5% and the pre-tax loss was $20 million, both improved from a year ago.  The improvement in pre-tax results is more than explained by higher net pricing and favorable mix.

   Asia Pacific Segment.    The following two charts detail the key metrics and the change in 2014 pre-tax results compared with 2013 by causal factor.  

Our strategy in Asia Pacific is to invest in growth through both new and expanded plants, new products, and the introduction of Lincoln in China. 
       
  As shown above, all full year metrics improved from a year ago and all were records.  Wholesale volume improved 13% compared with a year ago, while revenue, which excludes our China joint ventures, improved 5%.  Our wholesale volume in China, not shown, was up 19%.  Operating margin was 5.5%, up 2.3 percentage points, and pre-tax profit was $589 million, up $262 million.   
    
  As shown in the memo, our China joint ventures contributed $1.3 billion to pre-tax profit in 2014, reflecting our equity share of earnings after tax.  The balance of results for the region primarily reflect Australia where we are implementing our transformation plan; India where we are investing for future growth, including the launch of two plants later this year; and industry and economic factors in ASEAN. 
    
  Our market share in the region was a record 3.5% for the full year, up by 0.2 percentage points compared with 2013.  The improvement was driven by China, where our market share for the full year rose to a record 4.5%, up by 0.4 percentage points compared with 2013, reflecting continued strong sales across our vehicle line-up  .

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

The improvement in 2014 pre-tax results primarily reflects favorable market factors, offset partially by higher costs, including investments to support future growth, and unfavorable exchange.

   2013 Compared with 2012 
    
  Total Automotive.    The following two charts detail the key metrics and the change in 2013 pre-tax results compared with 2012 by causal factor.  Automotive operating margin is defined as Automotive pre-tax results, excluding special items and Other Automotive, divided by Automotive revenue. 
  
  As shown above, full-year wholesale volume and revenue for the Automotive sector were higher than a year ago by 12% and 10%, respectively.  Operating margin, at 5.4%, and pre-tax profit, at $6.9 billion, were also higher.   
    52 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

Higher pre-tax profit primarily reflects favorable marketable factors across all regions, offset partially by higher costs, mainly structural, and unfavorable exchange, principally in South America. 
    53 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Total costs and expenses   for our Automotive sector for 2013 and 2012 was $135.2 billion and $122.1 billion, respectively, a difference of $13.1 billion.  An explanation of the change is shown below (in billions): 

_________ 
           (a) 
    Our key cost change elements are measured primarily at present-year exchange; in addition, costs that vary directly with volume, such as material, freight and warranty costs, are measured at present-year volume and mix.  Excludes special items. 
       
  Results by Automotive Segment.    Details by segment of   Income before income taxes   are shown below for 2013. 
  
  In 2013, Automotive pre-tax profit was the highest in more than a decade, with record profits in North America and Asia Pacific Africa, an about breakeven result in South America, and a lower loss in Europe than last year.  Other Automotive reflects net interest expense, offset partially by a favorable fair market value adjustment of our investment in Mazda.

   North America Segment.    The following two charts detail the key metrics and the change in 2013 pre-tax results compared with 2012 by causal factor.  
  
  As shown above, North America s full-year wholesale volume and revenue both improved 11% compared with 2012.  Operating margin was 9.9%, 0.5 percentage points lower than a year ago, while pre-tax profit was $8.8 billion, up about $400 million.   
    
  For the full year, total U.S. market share was up 0.5 percentage points, more than explained by F-Series and Fusion, and U.S. retail share of retail industry was up 0.4 percentage points, more than explained by F-Series, Escape, and Fusion.

   South America Segment.    The following two charts detail the key metrics and the change in 2013 pre-tax results compared with 2012 by causal factor.  
  
  As shown above, full-year wholesale volume and revenue both improved 8% compared with last year.  Operating margin was negative 0.3%, and the pre-tax loss was $34 million, both lower than positive results a year ago.   
    57 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

The decrease in pre-tax profit for 2013 compared with 2012 is more than explained by higher costs and unfavorable exchange, offset partially by favorable market factors.  The higher net pricing reflects partial recovery of the adverse effects of high local inflation and weaker local currencies, along with pricing associated with our new products.

   Europe Segment.      The following two charts detail the key metrics and the change in 2013 pre-tax results compared with 2012 by causal factor.  
  
  Europe s full-year wholesale volume and revenue were up less than 1% and 5%, respectively, from a year ago.  Operating margin was negative 5.8% and the pre-tax loss was $1.6 billion, both improved from a year ago despite higher restructuring costs of about $400 million, lower industry volume, and unfavorable exchange.  
    
  Europe s full-year market share, at 7.8%, was down 0.1 percentage points, mainly reflecting low availability of Mondeo, S-MAX, and Galaxy in the first quarter.  For the year, total Europe retail share of the retail passenger car industry was up one percentage point, primarily due to B-MAX and Fiesta.  Our commercial vehicle market share for the full year, at 9.2%, was up 0.7 percentage points compared with the prior year, our highest share since 2007.  In 2013, Ford was the fastest-growing commercial vehicle brand, and Transit nameplate was the leader in the commercial van segment.

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR 
    
  As shown in the total Company discussion above, we present our Financial Services sector results in two segments, Ford Credit and Other Financial Services.  Ford Credit, in turn, has two operations, North America and International. 
    
  In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s pre-tax results using the causal factors listed below: 

Volume: 
                  
    Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average finance receivables and net investment in operating leases at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin). 
                  
    Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicle sales and leases, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail installment sale and lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding for the purchase of retail installment sale and lease contracts and to provide wholesale financing. 
       
     Financing Margin:  
               
    Financing margin variance is the period-to-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average receivables.  Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average receivables for the same period. 
                  
    Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense.  Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment.  Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management. 

Credit Loss:    
                  
    Credit loss measures changes in the provision for credit losses.  For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses primarily into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses. 
                  
    Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries.  Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in economic conditions.  For additional information on the allowance for credit losses, refer to the  Critical Accounting Estimates   -   Allowance for Credit Losses  section below. 

Lease Residual:    
                  
    Lease residual measures changes to residual performance.  For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation. 
                  
    Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value of the vehicles sold.  Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold, and changes in the estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term.  For additional information on accumulated supplemental depreciation, refer to the  Critical Accounting Estimates   -   Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases  section below. 

Other:    
                  
    Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, and insurance expenses. 
                  
    Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts. 
                  
    In general, other revenue changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates), which are included in unallocated risk management, and other miscellaneous items.

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   2014 Compared with 2013 
    
  Ford Credit.    The chart below details the change in 2014 pre-tax results compared with 2013 by causal factor. 

Ford Credit is a strategic asset and an integral part of our global growth and value creation strategy.  Ford Credit provides world-class dealer and customer financial services, supported by a strong balance sheet, providing solid profits and distributions to Ford.  
    
  The improvement of $98 million in pre-tax profit in 2014 compared with 2013 is more than explained by higher volume, driven by increases in consumer and non-consumer finance receivables globally, as well as an increase in operating leases in North America. 
    
  Partial offsets include unfavorable lease residual performance in North America, resulting from lower relative auction values, and lower financing margin.  The lower financing margin primarily reflects a one-time reserve in Europe and lower portfolio pricing in North America  . 

64 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Ford Credit s receivables, including finance receivables and operating leases, at December 31 were as follows (in billions):   

__________ 
           (a) 
    Dealer financing primarily includes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory. 
              (b) 
    At December 31, 2014 and 2013, includes consumer receivables before allowance for credit losses of $24.4 billion and $27.7 billion, respectively, and non-consumer receivables before allowance for credit losses of $21.8 billion and $23.9 billion, respectively, that have been sold for legal purposes in securitization transactions but continue to be reported in Ford Credit s financial statements.  In addition, at December 31, 2014 and 2013, includes net investment in operating leases before allowance for credit losses of $9.6 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, that have been included in securitization transactions but continue to be reported in Ford Credit s financial statements.  The receivables and net investment in operating leases are available only for payment of the debt issue by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay Ford Credit s other obligations or the claims of its other creditors.  Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions.   See Note 15 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding securitization transactions. 
       
  Managed receivables at December 31, 2014 increased from year-end 2013, driven by increases in consumer and non-consumer finance receivables in all operations and operating leases in North America  .

   2013 Compared with 2012 
    
  Ford Credit.    The chart below details the change in 2013 pre-tax results compared with 2012 by causal factor. 
  
  The improvement of $59 million is more than explained by higher volume, primarily in North America, driven by an increase in leasing reflecting changes in Ford s marketing programs, as well as higher non-consumer finance receivables due to higher dealer stocks. 
    
  Partial offsets are higher credit losses due to lower credit loss reserve reductions in all operations, and unfavorable residual performance related to lower than expected auction values in North America.

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Automotive Sector 
    
  Our Automotive liquidity strategy includes ensuring that we have sufficient liquidity available with a high degree of certainty throughout the business cycle by generating cash from operations and maintaining access to other sources of funding.  We target to have an average ongoing Automotive gross cash balance of about $20 billion.  We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to (i) future cash flow expectations such as for pension contributions, debt maturities, capital investments, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic environment.  In addition, we also target to maintain a revolving credit facility for our Automotive business of about $10 billion to protect against exogenous shocks.  Our revolving credit facility is discussed below.  
    
  We assess the appropriate long-term target for total Automotive liquidity, comprised of Automotive gross cash and the revolving credit facility, to be about $30 billion, which is an amount we believe is sufficient to support our business priorities and to protect our business.  Our Automotive gross cash and Automotive liquidity targets could be reduced over time based on improved operating performance and changes in our risk profile.   
  For a discussion of risks to our liquidity, see  Item 1A. Risk Factors,  as well as Note 27 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, regarding commitments and contingencies that could impact our liquidity. 
    
  Our key liquidity metrics are Automotive gross cash, Automotive liquidity, and operating-related cash flow (which best represents the ability of our Automotive operations to generate cash). 
    
  Automotive gross cash includes cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, net of any securities-in-transit.  Automotive gross cash is detailed below as of the dates shown (in billions): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    The purchase or sale of marketable securities for which the cash settlement was not made by period-end and a payable or receivable was recorded on the balance sheet. 
       
  Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held primarily in highly liquid investments, which provide for anticipated and unanticipated cash needs.  Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, corporate investment-grade securities, commercial paper rated A-1/P-1 or higher, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions.  The average maturity of these investments ranges from about 90 days to up to about one year, and is adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs.  We monitor our cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis.  Of our total Automotive gross cash at December 31, 2014, 89% was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. 
    
  Automotive gross cash and liquidity as of the dates shown were as follows (in billions): 

In managing our business, we classify changes in Automotive gross cash into operating-related and other items (which includes the impact of certain special items, contributions to funded pension plans, certain tax-related transactions, acquisitions and divestitures, capital transactions with the Financial Services sector, dividends paid to shareholders, and other primarily financing-related).   
    67 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   We believe the cash flow analysis reflected in the table below is useful to investors because it includes in operating-related cash flow elements that we consider to be related to our Automotive operating activities (e.g., capital spending) and excludes cash flow elements that we do not consider to be related to the ability of our operations to generate cash.  This differs from a cash flow statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) and differs from   Net     cash provided by/(used in) operating activities  , the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
    
  Changes in Automotive gross cash are summarized below (in billions): 

_________ 
           (a) 
    Working capital comprised of changes in receivables, inventory, and trade payables. 
              (b) 
    Primarily expense and payment timing differences for items such as pension and OPEB, compensation, marketing, warranty, and timing differences between unconsolidated affiliate profits and dividends received.  Also includes other factors, such as the impact of tax payments and vehicle financing activities between Automotive and FSG sectors. 
              (c) 
    Primarily distributions from Ford Holdings (Ford Credit s parent) and tax payments received from Ford Credit. 
              (d) 
    2014 includes one-time unfavorable cash effect associated with the accounting change for our operations in Venezuela; 2012 includes cash and marketable securities resulting from the consolidation of AAI. 
              (e) 
    In 2014, we used about $2 billion in cash to settle repurchases of approximately 116 million shares of Ford Common Stock. 
       
  With respect to  Changes in working capital,  in general we carry relatively low Automotive sector trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our Automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs at the time the vehicles are gate-released shortly after being produced.  In addition, our inventories are lean because we build to order, not for inventory.  In contrast, our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms generally ranging between 30 days to 45 days.  As a result, our cash flow tends to improve as wholesale volumes increase, but can deteriorate significantly when wholesale volumes drop sharply.  In addition, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow.  For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods, when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid.  The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.   
    
    68 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Shown below is a reconciliation between financial statement   Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities   and operating-related cash flows (calculated as shown in the table above), as of the dates shown (in billions): 

Credit Agreement  .  Lenders under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2014 (the  revolving credit facility ) have commitments to us totaling $12.2 billion, with about $9 billion maturing on April 30, 2019 and about $3 billion maturing on April 30, 2017.  We have allocated $2 billion of commitments to Ford Credit on an irrevocable and exclusive basis to support its liquidity.  Any borrowings by Ford Credit under the revolving credit facility would be guaranteed by us. 
    
  The revolving credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding. The revolving credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of $4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the revolving credit facility. If our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P (each as defined under  Total Company  below), the guarantees of certain subsidiaries will be required. 
    
  At December 31, 2014, the utilized portion of the revolving credit facility was $58 million, representing amounts utilized as letters of credit. 
    
  U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturer ( ATVM ) Incentive Program.    In September 2009, we entered into a Loan Arrangement and Reimbursement Agreement ( Arrangement Agreement ) with the DOE, under which we borrowed through multiple draws $5.9 billion to finance certain costs for fuel-efficient, advanced-technology vehicles.  At December 31, 2014, an aggregate of $4.4 billion was outstanding.  The principal amount of the ATVM loan bears interest at a blended rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time each draw was made (with the weighted-average interest rate on all such draws being about 2.3% per annum).      The ATVM loan is repayable in equal quarterly installments of $148 million, which began in September 2012 and will end in June 2022. 
    
  European Investment Bank ( EIB ) Loans.    On December 21, 2009, Ford Romania, our operating subsidiary in Romania, entered into a credit facility for an aggregate amount of  400 million (equivalent to $486 million at December 31, 2014) with the EIB (the  EIB Romania Facility ), and on July 12, 2010, Ford Motor Company Limited, our operating subsidiary in the United Kingdom, entered into a credit facility for an aggregate amount of  450 million (equivalent to $701 million at December 31, 2014) with the EIB (the  EIB United Kingdom Facility ).  The facilities were fully drawn at December 31, 2014.  Loans under the EIB Romania Facility and the EIB United Kingdom Facility bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.44% and 4% per annum, respectively, and mature on March 31, 2015 and September 11, 2015, respectively. 
    
  Other Automotive Credit Facilities.    At December 31, 2014, we had $822 million of local credit facilities available to non-U.S. Automotive affiliates, of which $175 million had been utilized.   
    
    69 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Net Cash.    Our Automotive sector net cash calculation as of the dates shown was as follows (in billions): 

Total debt at December 31, 2014 was $1.9 billion lower than December 31, 2013, primarily reflecting four quarterly installment payments on the ATVM loan which totaled about $600 million, the repayment of a $300 million U.S. Export-Import Bank loan, and the conversion into Ford Common Stock of $882 million of outstanding convertible debt, which resulted in a debt reduction of about $800 million. 
    
  We expect to reduce Automotive debt levels to about $10 billion by 2018.  We plan to achieve the debt reduction by 2018 by using cash from operations to make quarterly installment payments on the ATVM loan and repay the EIB loans and other debt at maturity. 
    
  Pension Plan Contributions and Strategy.    Worldwide, our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $9 billion at December 31, 2014, unchanged from December 31, 2013, despite significantly lower discount rates, which were offset by asset returns, contributions, and favorable exchange.  The U.S. weighted-average discount rate decreased 80 basis points to 3.94% at year-end 2014 from 4.74% at year-end 2013.  The non-U.S. weighted average discount rate decreased 101 basis points to 3.06% at year-end 2014 from 4.07% at year-end 2013.  Of the $9 billion underfunded status at year-end 2014, $6.5 billion, or about 70%, is associated with our unfunded plans. 
    
  Our long-term strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plans, including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension liabilities and the need for unplanned use of capital resources to fund the plans.  The strategy reduces balance sheet, cash flow, and income exposures and, in turn, reduces our risk profile.  The key elements of this strategy include: 

Limiting liability growth in our defined benefit plans by closing participation to new participants; 
                
    Reducing plan deficits through discretionary cash contributions; 
                
    Progressively re-balancing assets to more fixed income investments, with a target asset allocation to be reached over the next few years of about 80% fixed income investments and 20% growth assets, which will provide a better matching of plan assets to the characteristics of the liabilities, thereby reducing our net exposure; and 
                
    Taking other strategic actions to reduce pension liabilities, such as the voluntary lump sum payout program completed in 2013 for U.S. salaried retirees. 
       
  In 2014, we contributed $1.5 billion to our global funded pension plans (most of which were mandatory contributions), a decrease of $3.5 billion compared with 2013, reflecting our improved funded status.  During 2015, we expect to contribute $1.1 billion from Automotive cash and cash equivalents to our global funded pension plans outside the United States (most of which will be mandatory contributions). We also expect to make about $400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans, for a combined total of $1.5 billion.  Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans in 2015. 
    
  Asset returns in 2014 for our U.S. plans were 16.4% and 15.7 % for our non-U.S plans, reflecting fixed income gains as interest rates fell, as well as strong growth asset returns.  We have continued to progressively increase the mix of fixed income assets in our U.S. plans with the objective of reducing funded status volatility.  The fixed income mix in our U.S. plans at year-end 2014 was 77%, up from 70% at year-end 2013.  The U.S. plans were 97% funded at year end 2014.  As shown under  Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans,  this strategy has reduced the funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates.  
    
  Based on present planning assumptions for asset returns, discount rates, and planned cash contributions, we expect our global funded pension obligations to be fully funded by year-end 2016, with variability on a plan-by-plan basis.  Contributions to our global funded plans in 2016 are expected to be about $1.5 billion, including both required and discretionary contributions.  After 2016, we expect contributions to these plans to be limited to ongoing service cost of about $500 million per year.

   Liquidity Sufficiency  .  One of the four key priorities of our One Ford plan is to finance our plan and improve our balance sheet, while at the same time having resources available to grow our business.  The actions described above are consistent with this priority.  Based on our planning assumptions, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to continue to invest in new products that customers want and value, transform and grow our business, pay our debts and obligations as and when they come due, pay a sustainable dividend, and provide protection within an uncertain global economic environment.   
    
  Based on expected cash flows and the identification of additional opportunities for profitable growth, the ongoing amount of capital spending to support product development, growth, restructuring, and infrastructure is expected to increase to about $9 billion annually by 2020.  Our capital spending was $7.4 billion and $6.6 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is expected to be about $7.5 billion in 2015. 
    
  We will continue to work to strengthen further our balance sheet and improve our investment grade ratings; the amount of incremental capital required to do this will diminish over time as we achieve our target debt levels and fully fund and de-risk our global funded pension plans. 
    
    Financial Services Sector 
    
  Ford Credit 
    
  Funding Strategy.    Ford Credit s primary funding and liquidity objective is to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet with adequate liquidity to support its financing activities and growth under a variety of market conditions, including short-term and long-term market disruptions. 
    
  Ford Credit s funding strategy remains focused on diversification, and it plans to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels, and investors.  
    
  Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements.  Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it continues to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. 
    
  Funding Sources.    Ford Credit s funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions (including other structured financings).  Ford Credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both institutional and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months.  Ford Credit sponsors a number of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding through institutional investors in the United States and international capital markets. 
    
  Ford Credit obtains short-term unsecured funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes under its Ford Interest Advantage program and by issuing unsecured commercial paper in the United States and other international markets.  At December 31, 2014, the principal amount outstanding of Ford Interest Advantage notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holders thereof without restriction, was $5.6 billion.  At December 31, 2014, the principal amount outstanding of Ford Credit s unsecured commercial paper was $1.7 billion, which primarily represents issuance under its commercial paper program in the United States.  Ford Credit maintains multiple sources of readily available liquidity to fund the payment of its unsecured short-term debt obligations.

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Funding Portfolio.    The chart below details the trends in the funding of Ford Credit s managed receivables: 

At year-end 2014, managed receivables were $113     billion, and Ford Credit ended the year with about $9 billion in cash.  Securitized funding was 38% of managed receivables, down from 44% at year-end 2013, reflecting a greater mix of unsecured debt  . 
    
  Ford Credit is projecting 2015 year-end managed receivables of $123 billion to $128 billion and securitized funding as a percentage of managed receivables in the range of 36% to 38%.  Ford Credit expects this percentage will continue to decline over time. 
    
  Public Term Funding Plan.    The following table shows Ford Credit s planned issuances for full-year 2015, and its global public term funding issuances in 2014, 2013, and 2012 (in billions), excluding short-term funding programs: 
   
 __________ 
     
  In 2014, Ford Credit completed $28 billion of public term funding in the United States, Canada, Europe, Brazil, Mexico, and China, including about $13 billion of unsecured debt. 
    
  For 2015, Ford Credit projects full-year public term funding in the range of $25 billion to $31 billion.  Through February 12, 2015, Ford Credit has completed $6.3 billion of public term funding in the United States and Europe. 
    
    72 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Liquidity.    The following table shows Ford Credit s liquidity programs and utilization (in billions): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excludes marketable securities related to insurance activities). 
              (b) 
    Committed ABS lines are subject to availability of sufficient assets and ability to obtain derivatives to manage interest rate risk. 
              (c) 
    Used only to support on-balance sheet securitization transactions. 
              (d) 
    Adjustments include other committed ABS lines in excess of eligible receivables and certain cash within FordREV available through future sales of receivables. 
       
  At December     31, 2014, Ford Credit had total liquidity sources of $46.2 billion compared with total liquidity sources of $45.3 billion at December 31, 2013.  Its liquidity sources of committed capacity and cash are diversified across a variety of markets and platforms.  The utilization of its liquidity totaled $18.1 billion at year-end 2014, compared with $22.8 billion at year-end 2013.  The decrease of $4.7 billion reflects lower securitization cash and usage of its unsecured credit facilities. 
    
  Ford Credit ended 2014 with gross liquidity of $28.1 billion.  After adjustments totaling $1.6 billion, total liquidity available for use continues to remain strong at $26.5     billion at year-end 2014, $5.1 billion higher than year-end 2013.  
    
  Leverage.    Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure.  Ford Credit refers to its shareholder s interest as equity.   
    
  The following table shows the calculation of Ford Credit s financial statement leverage (in billions, except for ratios): 

__________ 
           (a)  
    Includes debt issued in securitization transactions and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements.  Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions. 
       
    73 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   The following table shows the calculation of Ford Credit s managed leverage (in billions, except for ratios): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    Includes debt issued in securitization transactions and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements.  Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions. 
              (b) 
    Excludes marketable securities related to insurance activities. 
              (c) 
    Primarily related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives due to movements in interest rates.  Adjustments to debt are related to designated fair value hedges and adjustments to equity are related to retained earnings. 
              (d) 
    Equals total adjusted debt over total adjusted equity. 
       
  Ford Credit believes that managed leverage is useful to its investors because it reflects the way Ford Credit manages its business.  Ford Credit deducts cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding marketable securities related to insurance activities) because they generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support its operations and amounts to support on-balance sheet securitization transactions.  Ford Credit makes derivative accounting adjustments to its assets, debt, and equity positions to reflect the impact of interest rate instruments Ford Credit uses in connection with its term-debt issuances and securitization transactions.  The derivative accounting adjustments related to these instruments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market interest rates.  Ford Credit generally repays its debt obligations as they mature.  As a result, Ford Credit excludes the impact of these derivative accounting adjustments on both the numerator and denominator in order to exclude the interim effects of changes in market interest rates.   
    
  Ford Credit plans its managed leverage by considering prevailing market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business.  At December     31,     2014, Ford Credit s managed leverage was 8.7:1, compared with 8.5:1 at December     31,     2013.  In 2015, Ford Credit expects managed leverage to continue in the range of 8:1 to 9:1.  In 2014, Ford Credit paid $395     million in distributions to its parent, Ford Holdings LLC.

   Total Company 
    
  Equity.    At December 31, 2014,   Total equity attributable to Ford Motor Company   was $24.8 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion compared with December 31, 2013.  The decrease primarily reflects unfavorable changes in   Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)   of $1.8 billion (more than explained by unfavorable pension and OPEB adjustments); unfavorable changes in   Treasury stock   of about $300 million related to net stock repurchases and re-issuances; and unfavorable changes in   Capital in excess of par value of stock   of about $300 million related to convertible note debt settlement net of compensation-related equity issuances; offset partially by favorable changes in   Retained earnings   of $1.2 billion related to full-year 2014   Net income attributable to Ford Motor Company   of $3.2 billion, net of cash dividends declared of $2 billion. 
    
  Credit Ratings.    Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ( NRSROs ) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: 

DBRS Limited ( DBRS  
                
    Fitch, Inc. ( Fitch  
                
    Moody s Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody s  and 
                
    Standard   Poor s Ratings Services, a division of McGraw Hill Financial ( S P ). 
       
  In several markets, locally-recognized rating agencies also rate us.  A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity.  Rating agencies  ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources.  Credit ratings assigned to us from all of the NRSROs are closely associated with their opinions on Ford.  Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.  Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency.  
    
  The following rating actions were taken by these NRSROs since September 30, 2014: 

On October 1, 2014, Fitch affirmed its ratings for Ford and Ford Credit, and maintained a positive outlook for both. 
                
    On October 29, 2014, DBRS affirmed its ratings for Ford and Ford Credit, and maintained a stable outlook for both. 
                
    On December 16, 2014, Moody s affirmed its ratings for Ford, and maintained a stable outlook. 
                
    On January 27, 2015, Moody s affirmed its ratings for Ford Credit, and maintained a stable outlook. 
       
  The following chart summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs:

   2014 PLANNING ASSUMPTIONS AND KEY METRICS  
    
  The following summarizes results against planning assumptions and key metrics established at the beginning of 2014: 

__________ 
           (a) 
    Based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy trucks. 
              (b) 
    Automotive operating margin is defined as Automotive pre-tax results, excluding special items and Other Automotive, divided by Automotive revenue. 
              (c) 
    Excludes special items; reconciliation to GAAP for full-year 2013 and 2014 provided in "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources," above.  Full year 2014 total Company pre-tax profit result was consistent with our updated guidance of about $6 billion, provided in September 2014. 
       
    PRODUCTION VOLUMES (a) 
    
  Our 2014 production volumes and first quarter 2015 projected production volumes are as follows (in thousands): 

__________

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   OUTLOOK 
    
  Business Environment 
    
  We project global economic growth to be in the 3% range led by the United States and China.  Global industry sales are expected to grow to between 88 million and 92 million units after estimated sales of 88 million units in 2014.  U.S. economic growth is expected to be in the 3% range.  Consumer sentiment is improving, along with lower fuel prices, which will boost consumer spending, providing support for growth.  South America faces continued market volatility and policy uncertainty.  A weak recovery is expected in Brazil while Argentina and Venezuela will remain in recession.  In Europe, growth in the Euro Area slowed after the first quarter of 2014, but is projected at just above 1% in 2015.  Growth in the United Kingdom is projected to remain in the 2.5% to 3% range.  In Russia, the combination of lower oil prices, geo-political events, and ruble depreciation will lead to a sharp decline in gross domestic product and higher inflation.  In Asia Pacific, China s economic growth is projected to be in the 7% to 7.5% range; consumer income growth will support an increase in vehicle sales but at a more moderate pace this year.  With some encouraging signs of improvement, growth in India is projected to rise above 6% in 2015, supported by a more favorable policy environment.  Overall, despite challenges in some key markets, we expect the global economy to grow in 2015 and be supportive of our projection for higher global industry volume this year. 
  Total Company 
    
  Our 2015 profit outlook by segment is as follows:    

__________       
  (a) Compared with 2014 
    
  North America 
    
  We expect North America to be strongly profitable, at a level higher than 2014, with an operating margin of 8% to 9%.  This outlook includes higher market share and net pricing, reflecting the impact of launching seven all-new or significantly refreshed products, as well as the effect of the record 16 launches in 2014, many of which occurred late in the year.  The F-150 changeover and downtime at our Kansas City plant will impact our first quarter 2015 results. 
  South America 
    
  In South America, pre-tax results are expected to be substantially improved from 2014, but still be a loss.  This outlook reflects the continuation of difficult macroeconomic conditions, with industry volume about equal to 2014.  We expect higher market share in 2015 as a result of new product introductions, including the all-new Ka.  We also expect higher net pricing, in part due to the new products, but also to recover, at least in part, the unfavorable effects of weaker currencies and high local inflation.  Finally, our South America results will not include the operating results of our Venezuela operations, including any impact of currency devaluations. 
    
  Europe 
    
  In Europe, pre-tax results are expected to improve from 2014, but still be a loss.  This outlook reflects higher market share, volume, and net pricing in the Europe 20 markets, despite intense competition across the region, as well as weak economic growth in the Euro Area.  This is updated from our September 2014 Investor Day guidance of a loss of about $250 million, largely due to uncertainty around conditions in Russia, as well as higher pension expense in 2015 as a result of even lower discount rates. 
    
    77 

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Middle East   Africa 
    
  Middle East   Africa is expected to deliver a loss somewhat larger than 2014 as we invest for future growth. 
  Asia Pacific 
    
  In Asia Pacific, we expect wholesale volume, market share, and pre-tax profit to be higher than 2014 as we continue to introduce new products and bring online new capacity. 
    
  Net Interest Expense 
    
  Automotive net interest expense is expected to be equal to or higher than 2014. 
    
  Ford Credit 
    
  Ford Credit continues to implement its growth plan and expects pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014.  This outlook reflects year-end managed receivables in the range of $123 billion to $128 billion, managed leverage to continue in the range of 8:1 to 9:1, and distributions of about $250 million. 
  2015 Calendarization Effects 
    
  We expect the calendarization of our total Company pre-tax results, excluding special items, to be atypical in 2015.  Historically, the first half of the year is more profitable for us than the second half.  In 2015, however, we expect the reverse to be the case due primarily to the following factors: 

In North America, the all-new F-150 changeover and downtime at the Kansas City plant will affect first quarter results.  We also will incur costs and lost volume in the first half of the year related to our seven product launches in 2015, including the Edge and Explorer.  We expect to see the benefit of these launches in the second half of 2015. 

In Asia Pacific, we are leveraging our global product portfolio to introduce 18 new vehicles in 2015.  This will result in lower first half results as we continue to invest in four new plants that will bring new capacity online for the second half of 2015.

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   2015 Planning Assumptions and Key Metrics 
    
  Based on the current economic environment, our planning assumptions and key metrics for 2015 include the following: 

__________       
           (a)   
    Based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy trucks. 
              (b) 
    Automotive operating margin is defined as Automotive pre-tax results, excluding special items and Other Automotive, divided by Automotive revenue. 
              (c) 
    Excludes special items; reconciliation to GAAP for full-year 2014 provided in  Results of Operations  and  Liquidity and Capital Resources  above. 
       
  For 2015, we now expect U.S. industry volume to range from 17 million to 17.5 million units, Europe 20 markets to range from 14.8 million to 15.3 million units, and China to range from 24.5 million to 26.5 million units. 
    
  For our financial metrics, we expect Automotive revenue, Automotive operating margin, and Automotive operating-related cash flow to be higher than 2014.  This includes capital spending of about $7.5 billion in 2015.   
    
  Ford Credit s pre-tax profit is expected to be equal to or higher than 2014. 
    
  We expect our operating effective tax rate, which excludes the profits of our unconsolidated subsidiaries, to be about equal to our 2014 rate of 35%, assuming extension of U.S. research credit legislation in the fourth quarter of 2015.   
    
  We expect total Company pre-tax profit, excluding special items, to range from $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion in 2015. 
    
  Overall, we expect very strong growth and substantially improved financial performance in 2015 driven by our investments in new products and capacity.

    Increased safety, emissions, fuel economy, or other regulations resulting in higher costs, cash expenditures, and/or sales restrictions;   
                
    Unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise;   
                
    A change in requirements under long-term supply arrangements committing Ford to purchase minimum or fixed quantities of certain parts, or to pay a minimum amount to the seller ( take-or-pay  contracts);   
                
    Adverse effects on results from a decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentives related to investments;

    Cybersecurity risks to operational systems, security systems, or infrastructure owned by Ford, Ford Credit, or a third-party vendor or supplier;   
                
    Failure of financial institutions to fulfill commitments under committed credit and liquidity facilities;   
                
    Inability of Ford Credit to access debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts, due to credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors;   
                
    Higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles;

  We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized.  It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results.  Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
    
    We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:  1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above.  Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  Warranty and Field Service Actions 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required.   We provide warranties on the products we sell. Separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns.  Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace or adjust all parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship.  We accrue the estimated cost of both basic warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale.  
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used.    We establish estimates for warranty and field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model.  We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year.  We reevaluate our estimate of warranty and field service obligations on a regular basis.  Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available.  As actual experience becomes available, we use the data to modify the historical averages in order to ensure that the estimate is within the range of likely outcomes.  We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to ensure that the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations.  Based on these data, we revise our estimates as necessary.  Warranty coverages vary; therefore, our warranty accruals vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale for specific periods of time and/or mileage.  Field service actions are distinguishable from warranties in that they may occur in periods beyond the basic warranty coverage period.  Our best estimate of the obligation related to field service actions includes expected future payments related to vehicles produced in the most recent eight model years and announced field service actions for vehicles produced before this period.   
    
      Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.  See Note 27 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and product recall related costs. 
    
  Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits  
    
  Nature of Estimates Required.    The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as demographic experience and health care cost increases.  Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions.  No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts). 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used.    The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: 

Discount rates.    Our discount rate assumption is based primarily on the results of a cash flow matching analysis, which matches the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the country of the plan.  Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve and a single discount rate specific to the plan is determined. 
                
    Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.    Our expected long-term rate of return assumption reflects historical returns and long-run inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, inflation, bond yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy such as asset mix.  The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences.   
                
    Salary growth.    Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed inflation. 
                
    Inflation.    Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets. 
       
    81 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

Expected contributions.    Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies, and tax efficiency). 
                
    Retirement rates.    Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. 
                
    Mortality rates.    Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. 
                
    Health care cost trends  .  Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends.  
       
  Assumptions are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event such as a significant curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement. 
    
  The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are recorded as unamortized net gains or losses in   Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)   on our balance sheet.  Unamortized gains and losses are amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. 
    
  Mortality Assumptions.    As part of the normal management of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, we consistently review our demographic assumptions and actual experience, including our assumptions for mortality.  At year-end 2014, we updated our assumptions for future mortality improvements in our North American defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, taking into consideration recent mortality information published by recognized experts in this field, primarily the U.S. Society of Actuaries and the Canadian Institute of Actuaries.  This information was considered, along with the characteristics of our plan-specific populations and other data where appropriate, in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality of plan participants.  The impact of this update on our global pension and OPEB obligations was not significant and is included in the benefit obligations shown in Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. 
    
  See Note     12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions. 
    
  Pension Plans 
    
  Effect of Actual Results  .  The year-end 2014 weighted average discount rate was 3.94% for U.S. plans and 3.06% for non-U.S. plans, reflecting decreases of 80 and 101 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2013.  In 2014, the U.S. actual return on assets was 16.4%, which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 6.89%.  Non-U.S. actual return on assets was 15.7%, which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 6.63%.  In total, these differences resulted in a net increase in unamortized losses of about $3 billion which are expected to be recognized as a component of net expense over the expected future years of service (approximately 10 years for our major U.S. plans and 11 years for our major non-U.S. plans). 
    
  For 2015, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 6.75% for U.S. plans and 6.11% for non-U.S. plans, down 14 basis points and 52 basis points, respectively, compared with a year ago, reflecting primarily a higher fixed income allocation  . 
    
  Worldwide pension expense, excluding special items, was $1 billion in 2014, $600 million lower than 2013, driven primarily by higher discount rates at year-end 2013 compared with 2012.  Based on year-end assumptions, we expect 2015 pension expense to be higher compared with 2014, reflecting primarily lower discount rates at year-end 2014 compared with 2013. 
     
  De-risking Strategy  .   In 2012, we adopted a broad global de-risking strategy which increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves.  Changes in interest rates (which directly influence changes in discount rates), in addition to other factors, have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio.  As we de-risk our plans and increase the allocation to fixed income investments over time, we expect the funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates will be significantly reduced.   Any change in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio. 
    
  Sensitivity Analysis.    The December 31, 2014 pension funded status and 2015 expense are affected by year-end 2014 assumptions.  Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted.   The effects of changes in the factors which generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are discussed below. 
    82 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our net funded status. The table below estimates the impact as of December 31, 2014 on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions):  

The fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., bond coupon and active management excess returns), growth asset returns and changes in value of related insurance contracts.  Other factors that impact net funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected. 
    
  Discount rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest impact on pension expense.  These assumptions are generally set at each year end for expense recorded throughout the following year.  The table below estimates the impact on 2015 pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions):   

The impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities.  The sensitivity of pension expense to an increase in discount rates assumptions may not be linear.  
    
  Other Postretirement Employee Benefits 
    
  Effect of Actual Results  .  The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for U.S. OPEB plans at December 31, 2014 was 3.86%, compared with 4.65% at December 31, 2013, resulting in an unamortized loss of about $400 million.  This amount is expected to be recognized as a component of net expense over the expected future years of service (approximately 12 years). 
    
  Sensitivity Analysis.    The effect on U.S. and Canadian plans of a 100 basis point increase/(decrease) in the assumed discount rate would have resulted in a (lower)/higher postretirement benefit expense for 2015 of approximately $(40) million/$40 million, and in the year-end 2014 obligation of approximately $(720) million/$850 million. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required.    We must make estimates and apply judgment in determining the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes.  We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas:  (i) the calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes that will ultimately be reported in tax returns, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.  Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs. 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used.    We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate.  These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation.  We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a  process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions.  If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably to us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized.  This process is inherently subjective, since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes.  We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities.  Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred. 
    
    83 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income.  GAAP requires a reduction of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.   
    
  We presently believe that a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion is required, primarily for deferred tax assets related to our South America operations.  We believe that we ultimately will recover the remaining $13.1 billion of deferred tax assets.  We have assessed recoverability of these assets, and concluded that no valuation allowance is required.   
    
  For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 21 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. 
    
    Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  The allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credit     s estimate of the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables and operating leases as of the balance sheet date.  The adequacy of Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly.  Because credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain.  See Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses. 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required.    Ford Credit estimates the probable credit losses inherent in finance receivables and operating leases based on several factors. 
    
  Consumer Portfolio.    Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses on consumer receivables and on operating leases using a combination of measurement models and management judgment.  The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses and recoveries (including key metrics such as delinquencies, repossessions, and bankruptcies), the composition of Ford Credit     s present portfolio (including vehicle brand, term, risk evaluation, and new/used vehicles), trends in historical used vehicle values, and economic conditions.  Estimates from these models rely on historical information and may not fully reflect losses inherent in the present portfolio.  Therefore, Ford Credit may adjust the estimate to reflect management judgment regarding observable changes in recent economic trends and conditions, portfolio composition, and other relevant factors. 
    
  Assumptions Used.    Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is based on assumptions regarding: 

Frequency.    The number of finance receivables and operating lease contracts that are expected to default over the loss emergence period, measured as repossessions; and 
                
    Loss severity.    The expected difference between the amount a customer owes when the finance contract is charged off and the amount received, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer. 
       
  Collective Allowance for Credit Losses.    The collective allowance is evaluated primarily using a collective loss-to receivables ( LTR ) model that, based on historical experience, indicates credit losses have been incurred in the portfolio even though the particular accounts that are uncollectible cannot be specifically identified.  The LTR model is based on the most recent years of history.  Each LTR is calculated by dividing credit losses by average end-of-period finance receivables or average end-of-period operating leases, excluding unearned interest supplements and allowance for credit losses.  An average LTR is calculated for each product and multiplied by the end-of-period balances for that given product. 
    
  Ford Credit s largest markets also use a loss projection model to estimate losses inherent in the portfolio.  The loss projection model applies recent monthly performance metrics, stratified by contract type (retail or lease), contract term (e.g., 60-month), and risk rating to Ford Credit s active portfolio to estimate the losses that have been incurred. 
    
  The loss emergence period ( LEP ) is a key assumption within Ford Credit s models and represents the average amount of time between when a loss event first occurs to when it is charged off.  This time period starts when the consumer begins to experience financial difficulty.  It is evidenced, typically through delinquency, before eventually resulting in a charge-off.  The LEP is a multiplier in the calculation of the collective consumer allowance for credit losses. 
    
  For accounts greater than 120 days past due, the uncollectible portion is charged off, such that the remaining recorded investment is equal to the estimated fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 
    
    84 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Specific Allowance for Impaired Receivables  .  Consumer receivables involved in troubled debt restructurings are specifically assessed for impairment.  A specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the receivable discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of any collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell. 
    
  After establishing the allowance for credit losses, if Ford Credit management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions, or other relevant factors, an adjustment is made based on management judgment. 
    
  Sensitivity Analysis.    Changes in the assumptions used to derive frequency and severity would affect the allowance for credit losses.  The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln brand retail financing and operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions, except for percentages): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    Reflects the number of finance receivables and operating lease contracts that Ford Credit expects will default over a period of time relative to the average number of contracts outstanding. 
       
  Non-Consumer Portfolio.    Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for non-consumer receivables based on historical LTR ratios, expected future cash flows, and the fair value of collateral. 
    
  Collective Allowance for Credit Losses.    Ford Credit estimates an allowance for non-consumer receivables that are not specifically identified as impaired using a LTR model for each financing product based on historical experience.  This LTR is an average of the most recent historical experience and is calculated consistent with the consumer receivables LTR approach.  All accounts that are specifically identified as impaired are excluded from the calculation of the non-specific or collective allowance. 
    
  Specific Allowance for Impaired Receivables.    Dealer financing is evaluated by segmenting individual loans by the risk characteristics of the loan (such as the amount of the loan, the nature of the collateral, and the financial status of the debtor).  The loans are analyzed to determine whether individual loans are impaired, and a specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the receivable discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell. 
    
  After establishing the allowance for credit losses, if Ford Credit management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions, or other relevant factors, an adjustment is made based on management judgment. 
    
  Changes in Ford Credit s assumptions affect the   Provision for credit losses and insurance losses   on our income statement and the allowance for credit losses contained within   Finance receivables, net   and   Net investment in     operating leases   on our balance sheet, in each case under the Financial Services sector. 
    
  Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases 
    
  Accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credit s operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term.   
    
  Ford Credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis.  If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credit s revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term.  Such adjustments to depreciation expense would result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. 
    
  Each lease customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer.  
    
    85 

    Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   Nature of Estimates Required.    Each operating lease in Ford Credit s portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer.  At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle.  Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for its leased vehicles, industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data. 
    
  Assumptions Used.    Ford Credit s accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding: 

Auction value.    Ford Credit s projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and 
                
    Return volume.    Ford Credit s projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end. 
       
  See Note 6 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases. 
    
     Sensitivity Analysis.    For returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle.  The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln brand operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions, except for percentages): 

The impact of the increased accumulated supplemental depreciation in 2014 would be charged to expense in the  
  2015 - 2018 periods.  Adjustments to the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases would be reflected on our balance sheet as   Net investment in operating leases   and on the income statement in   Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases  , in each case under the Financial Services sector.

      Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   

   AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
    
  We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties.  Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services sector.  Long-term debt may have fixed or variable interest rates.  For long-term debt with variable-rate interest, we estimate the future interest payments based on projected market interest rates for various floating-rate benchmarks received from third parties.  In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services.  These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements.   Purchase obligations  are defined as off-balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms.   
    
  The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 (in millions): 

__________       
  (a)  Amount includes, prior to adjustment noted above, $2,128 million for the Automotive sector and $25,533 million for the Financial Services sector for the current portion of long-term debt.  See Note 13 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for additional discussion. 
  (b)  Automotive sector excludes unamortized debt discounts/premiums of $(144) million.  Financial Services sector excludes unamortized debt discounts of $(55) million and adjustments of $428 million related to designated fair value hedges of the debt. 
  (c)  Excludes amortization of debt discounts/premiums. 
  (d)  Amounts represent our estimate of contractually obligated deficit contributions to U.K. plans.  See Note 12 for further information regarding our expected 2015 pension contributions and funded status. 
    
  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits for 2014 of $1.3 billion (see Note 21 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for additional discussion) is excluded from the table above.  Final settlement of a significant portion of these obligations will require bilateral tax agreements among us and various countries, the timing of which cannot reasonably be estimated. 
    
  For additional information regarding operating lease obligations, pension and OPEB obligations, and long-term debt, see Notes 6, 12, and 13, respectively, of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

ITEM 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  OVERVIEW 
    
  We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. 
    
  These risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently.  We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ( GRMC ).  The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our Corporate Controller, and other members of senior management. 
    
  Our Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, including the possibility of having to curtail business or being unable to meet financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable.  Our plan is to maintain funding sources to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles.  As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include sales of receivables in securitizations and other structured financings, unsecured debt issuances, equity and equity-linked issuances, and bank borrowings. 
    
  We are exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury.  We protect against these risks through the purchase of commercial insurance that is designed to protect us above our self-insured retentions against events that could generate significant losses. 
    
  Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurer s Office and is governed by written policies and procedures.  Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows.  Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective.  In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are approved by the GRMC, and reviewed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
    
  In accordance with our corporate risk management policies, we use derivative instruments, when available, such as forward contracts, swaps and options that economically hedge certain exposures (foreign currency, commodity, and interest rates).  We do not use derivative contracts for trading, market-making, or speculative purposes.  In certain instances, we forgo hedge accounting, and in certain other instances, our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.  Either situation results in unrealized gains and losses that are recognized in income.  For additional information on our derivatives, see Note     16 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. 
    
  The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are discussed and quantified below. 
    
    AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK 
    
  Our Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following:  purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations.  These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates.  We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest rates.   
    
  Foreign currency risk, commodity risk, and interest rate risk are measured and quantified using a model to evaluate the sensitivity of market value to instantaneous, parallel shifts in rates and/or prices.   
    
  Foreign Currency Risk.    Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in currency exchange rates.  Accordingly, our normal practice is to use derivative instruments, when available, to hedge our economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenues and costs, assets, liabilities, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.  In our hedging actions, we use derivative  instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts).

    Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)                                            

   The net fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk), as of December     31, 2014, was a liability of $130 million compared with an asset of $158 million as of December     31, 2013.  The potential decrease in fair value from a 10% adverse change in the underlying exchange rates, in U.S. dollar terms, would have been $2.1 billion at December     31, 2014, compared with $2 billion at December     31, 2013.  The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes foreign exchange rate changes are instantaneous and adverse across all currencies.  In reality, foreign exchange rates move in different magnitudes and at different times, and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure.  See Note 16 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contracts.   
    
  Commodity Price Risk.    Commodity price risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in the prices of commodities used in the production of motor vehicles, such as base metals (e.g., steel, copper, and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g.,     natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene).  Accordingly, our normal practice is to use derivative instruments, when available, to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchases of those commodities that we can economically hedge (primarily base metals and precious metals).  In our hedging actions, we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts). 
    
  The net fair value of commodity forward and option contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of December     31, 2014 was a liability of $66 million compared with an asset of $4 million as of December     31, 2013.  The potential decrease in fair value from a 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity prices, in U.S. dollar terms, would be $63     million at December     31, 2014, compared with $70     million at December     31, 2013.  
    
  In addition, our purchasing organization (with guidance from the GRMC as appropriate) negotiates contracts to ensure continuous supply of raw materials.  In some cases, these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific prices, and, therefore, play a role in managing price risk. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk.    Interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur in our Automotive investment portfolios due to a change in interest rates.  Our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolios includes cash and cash equivalents and net marketable securities.  At December 31, 2014, we had $21.7 billion in our Automotive investment portfolios, compared to $24.8 billion at December 31, 2013.  We invest the portfolios in securities of various types and maturities, the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates.  The portfolios are classified as trading portfolios and gains and losses (unrealized and realized) are reported in the income statement.  The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short-term investments.  In investing our Automotive cash, safety of principal is the primary objective and risk-adjusted return is the secondary objective. 
    
  At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolios.  Assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our portfolios would be reduced by about $148 million as calculated as of December 31, 2014.  This compares to $193 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2013.  While these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected.  The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve.  In reality, interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel. 
    
  Counterparty Risk.    Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract.  We enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to manage this risk.  Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and commodity price risk.  We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification.    
    
  Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward-looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions before risks become losses.  Exposure limits are established based on our overall risk tolerance and estimated loss projections which are calculated from ratings-based historical default probabilities and market-based credit default swap ( CDS ) spreads  .    The exposure limits are lower for lower-rated counterparties, counterparties that have relatively higher CDS spreads, and for longer-dated exposures  .    Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and included in periodic reports to our Treasurer. 
    
  Substantially all of our counterparty exposures are with counterparties that have an investment grade rating.   Investment grade is our guideline for counterparty minimum long-term ratings.

      Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)                                            

   FORD CREDIT MARKET RISK 
    
  Overview.    Ford Credit is exposed to a variety of risks in the normal course of its business activities.  In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify, assess, monitor, and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures: 

Market risk   - the possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates will adversely affect cash flow and economic value; 
                
    Credit risk   - the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payments according to contract terms; 
                
    Residual risk   - the possibility that the actual proceeds received at lease termination will be lower than projections or return volumes will be higher than projections; and 
                
    Liquidity risk   - the possibility that Ford Credit may be unable to meet all of its current and future obligations in a timely manner. 
       
  Each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credit s overall global risk.  Business decisions are evaluated on a risk-adjusted basis and services are priced consistent with these risks.  Credit and residual risks, as well as liquidity risk, are discussed above in Item 7.  A discussion of Ford Credit s market risks (interest rate risk and foreign currency risk) is included below. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk  .  Generally, Ford Credit s assets and the related debt have different re-pricing periods, and consequently, respond differently to changes in interest rates. 
    
  Ford Credit s assets consist primarily of fixed-rate retail installment sale and operating lease contracts and floating-rate wholesale receivables.  Fixed-rate retail installment sale and operating lease contracts generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract.  Wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicles held in dealers  inventory and generally require dealers to pay a floating rate. 
    
  Debt consists primarily of short- and long-term unsecured debt and securitizations.  In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles, Ford Credit may borrow at terms longer than the terms of its assets, in most instances with maturities up to ten years.  These debt instruments are principally fixed-rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity. 
    
  Ford Credit s interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows and volatility in its economic value from changes in interest rates based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market. 
    
  Ford Credit uses economic value sensitivity analysis and re-pricing gap analysis to evaluate potential long-term effects of changes in interest rates.  It then enters into interest rate swaps to convert portions of its floating-rate debt to fixed or its fixed-rate debt to floating to ensure that Ford Credit s exposure falls within the established tolerances.  Ford Credit also uses pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of near-term cash flow exposure.  The pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis measures the changes in expected cash flows associated with Ford Credit s interest-rate-sensitive assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments from hypothetical changes in interest rates over a twelve-month horizon.  Ford Credit s Asset-Liability Committee reviews the re-pricing mismatch and exposure every month and approves interest rate swaps required to maintain exposure within approved thresholds prior to execution.   
     
  To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre-tax cash flow to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rates across all maturities (a  parallel shift ), as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at existing levels.  In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in Ford Credit s analysis.  As a result, the actual impact to pre-tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent Ford Credit s view of future interest rate movements. 
    
  Under these interest rate scenarios, Ford Credit expects more debt and liabilities than assets to re-price in the next twelve months.  Other things being equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on Ford Credit s assets will increase less than the interest paid on Ford Credit s debt, thereby initially decreasing Ford Credit s pre-tax cash flow.  During a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credit would expect its pre-tax cash flow to initially increase. Ford Credit s pre-tax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement is highlighted in the table below.

   Pre-tax cash flow sensitivity as of year-end 2014 and 2013 was as follows (in millions): 
                               
    Pre-Tax Cash Flow Sensitivity (given a one percentage point instantaneous   increase   in interest rates)

_____ 
           (a) 
    Pre-tax cash flow sensitivity given a one percentage point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in markets where existing interest rates are below one percent. 
       
  While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credit s best estimate of the impacts of the specified assumed interest rate scenarios, its actual results could differ from those projected.  The model Ford Credit uses to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions.  Embedded in the model are assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives, exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives, and predicted repayment of retail installment sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity.  Ford Credit s repayment projections ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience.  If interest rates or other factors change, Ford Credit s actual prepayment experience could be different than projected. 
    
  Foreign Currency Risk.    Ford Credit s policy is to minimize exposure to changes in currency exchange rates.  To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit borrows in a variety of currencies, principally U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, Pound Sterling, and renminbi.  Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables.  When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements.  When a different currency is used, Ford Credit may use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables.  As a result of this policy, Ford Credit believes its market risk exposure, relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2014, is insignificant. 
    
  Derivative Fair Values.    The net fair value of Ford Credit s derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2014 was an asset of $692 million, compared to an asset of $79 million as of December 31, 2013.

ITEM 9A.   Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    Mark Fields, our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), have performed an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), as of December 31, 2014, and each has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
    
  Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.    Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.  The assessment was based on criteria established in the framework   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)  , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014. 
    
  The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
  Ford Motor Company 
    
  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ford Motor Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
    
  The accompanying sector balance sheets and the related sector statements of income and of cash flows, included as supplemental information, have been subjected to audit procedures performed in conjunction with the audit of the Company s consolidated financial statements.  The supplemental information is the responsibility of the Company s management.  Our audit procedures included determining whether the supplemental information reconciles to the financial statements or the underlying accounting and other records, as applicable, and performing procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the information presented in the supplemental information.  In our opinion, the sector balance sheets and the related sector statements of income and of cash flows are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

      FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1.      PRESENTATION    
    
  For purposes of this report,  Ford,  the  Company,   we,   our,   us  or similar references mean Ford Motor Company, our consolidated subsidiaries and our consolidated VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary, unless the context requires otherwise. 
    
  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ).  We present the financial statements on both a consolidated basis and on a sector basis for our Automotive and Financial Services sectors.  The additional information provided in the sector statements enables the reader to better understand the operating performance, financial position, cash flows, and liquidity of our two very different businesses.  We eliminate all intercompany items and transactions in the consolidated and sector balance sheets.  In certain circumstances, presentation of these intercompany eliminations or consolidated adjustments differ between the consolidated and sector financial statements.  These line items are reconciled below under  Reconciliations between Consolidated and Sector Financial Statements  or in the related financial statements and footnotes.  
    
  We reclassified certain prior year amounts in our consolidated financial statements to conform to current year presentation.   
    
  Changes in Accounting 
    
  Disability Accounting.    We provide medical, life, and income benefits to hourly and salary employees when they become disabled.  As of January 1, 2014, we changed our accounting policy for these benefits from an event-driven model to a service-accrual model, such that our obligation now includes an estimated cost to be incurred for individuals who are disabled at the time of measurement (which was the amount recorded under our previous policy) as well as an amount that considers the probability that active employees will become disabled in the future.  We believe this change in accounting method is preferable because it better aligns the recognition of expense with the periods in which the Company receives the benefit of the employees  services, and will allow for better comparability with the method used by other companies in our industry. 
    
  We have retroactively applied this change in accounting method to all prior period amounts.  As of December 31, 2011, the cumulative effect of the change decreased   Total equity   by   $250 million  . 
  The cumulative effect of this change on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31 was as follows (in millions): 

The effect of this change was immaterial to our consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.

  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1.      PRESENTATION     (Continued) 
    
  Venezuelan Operations.    On February 13, 2013, the Venezuelan government effected a devaluation of the bolivar, from an exchange rate of   4.3   bolivars to the U.S. dollar to an exchange rate of   6.3   bolivars to the U.S. dollar.  This resulted in a remeasurement loss of   $186 million   in   Automotive cost of sales   in the first quarter of 2013.   
    
  Based on changes to Venezuelan currency exchange rate mechanisms in the first quarter of 2014, we changed the exchange rate we used to remeasure the financial statements of our Venezuelan subsidiaries in U.S. dollars.  Since March 31, 2014, we have used the exchange rate determined by periodic auctions for U.S. dollars conducted under Venezuela s Complementary System of Foreign Currency Administration ( SICAD I ).  The exchange rate we used at March 31, 2014 was   10.8   bolivars to the U.S. dollar and resulted in a remeasurement loss of   $316 million   in in the first quarter of 2014 (  $310 million   related to our Automotive sector and   $6 million   related to our Financial Services sector).  
    
  Prior to December 31, 2014, we included the results of our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements using the consolidation method of accounting.  Venezuelan exchange control regulations have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, and have restricted our Venezuelan operations  ability to pay dividends and obligations denominated in U.S. dollars.  These exchange regulations, combined with other recent Venezuelan regulations, have constrained parts availability and are now significantly limiting our Venezuelan operations  ability to maintain normal production.  As a result of these conditions, and in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810 -- Consolidation, we began reporting the results of our Venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting.  This change, which we made effective December 31, 2014, resulted in a fourth quarter 2014 one-time pre-tax charge of   $800 million   in   Automotive interest income and other income/(loss), net  .  Our Venezuelan operations  cash balance of   $477 million   at December 31, 2014, is no longer reported in   Cash and cash equivalents  .  In future periods, our financial results will not include the operating results of our Venezuelan operations.  Instead, we will record cash and recognize income from our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements to the extent we are paid for parts we sell to them or receive dividends from them. 
    
  Ford has operated in Venezuela for the last   53 years   and our operations in Venezuela will continue for the foreseeable future.  We continue to work proactively with the Venezuelan official agencies to ensure they understand our Venezuelan operations  business needs and potential production opportunities. 
    
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
    
  Income Taxes   -   Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.    On January 1, 2014, we adopted the new accounting standard that requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented as a decrease in a deferred tax asset when a net operating loss, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists and certain criteria are met.  The new accounting standard is consistent with our prior practice, and thus the adoption did not impact our financial statements. 
    
  Foreign Currency Matters   -   Parent     s Accounting for Cumulative Translation Adjustment.    On January 1, 2014, we adopted the new accounting standard that clarifies the applicable guidance for a parent company s accounting for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity.  The new accounting standard is consistent with our prior practice, and thus the adoption did not impact our financial statements. 
    
  Liabilities   -   Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements.    On January 1, 2014, we adopted the new accounting standard that provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements.  The adoption of this accounting standard did not impact our financial statements or financial statement disclosures.

  Reconciliations between Consolidated and Sector Financial Statements 
    
  Sector to Consolidated Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities.    The difference between the total assets and total liabilities as presented on our sector balance sheet and consolidated balance sheet is the result of netting deferred income tax assets and liabilities.  The reconciliation between the totals for the sector and consolidated balance sheets at December 31 was as follows (in millions): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    Financial Services deferred income tax assets are included in   Financial Services Other assets   on our sector balance sheet. 
       
  Certain Transactions Between Automotive and Financial Services Sectors 
    
  Intersector transactions occur in the ordinary course of business.  Additional detail regarding certain transactions and the effect on each sector s balance sheet at December 31 was as follows (in billions):   

  __________ 
           (a) 
    Automotive sector receivables (generated primarily from vehicle and parts sales to third parties) sold to Ford Credit.  These receivables are classified as   Other receivables, net   on our consolidated balance sheet and   Finance receivables, net   on our sector balance sheet. 
              (b) 
    We pay amounts to Ford Credit at the point of retail financing or lease origination that represent interest supplements and residual support. 
              (c) 
    Primarily wholesale receivables with entities that are consolidated subsidiaries of Ford.   
              (d)

NOTE 2.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
    
  For each accounting topic that is addressed in its own footnote, the description of the accounting policy may be found in the related footnote.  Other significant accounting policies are described below. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results during the periods reported.  Estimates are used to account for certain items such as marketing accruals, warranty costs, employee benefit programs, etc.  Estimates are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ. 
    
  Foreign Currency 
    
  We remeasure monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from a reporting entity s functional currency from the applicable currency to the legal entity s functional currency.  The effect of this remeasurement process, and the results of our foreign currency hedging activities are reported in   Automotive cost of sales, Selling, administrative, and other expenses,   and   Automotive interest income and other income, net  .  The pre-tax losses for this activity were   $510 million  ,   $349 million  , and   $426 million  , for the years ended   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively. 
    
  We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars using end-of-period exchange rates.  Generally, our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency.  Changes in the carrying value of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates are recognized in   Foreign currency translation  , a component of   Other comprehensive income/(Ioss).    Upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, the amount of accumulated foreign currency translation related to the entity is reclassified to   Net income   and recognized as part of the gain or loss on the investment. 
    
  Restricted Cash 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements are recorded in   Other assets   on our balance     sheet.  Our Automotive sector restricted cash balances primarily include various escrow agreements related to legal, insurance, customs, and environmental matters.  Our Financial Services sector restricted cash balances primarily include cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory     reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements.  Restricted cash does not include required minimum balances or cash securing debt issued through securitization transactions. 
    
  Trade Receivables 
    
  Trade receivables, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in   Other receivables,     net  , consist primarily of Automotive sector receivables for vehicles, parts, and accessories.  Trade receivables initially are recorded at the transaction amount.  We record an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our estimate of the probable losses.  Each reporting period, we assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts taking into consideration recoveries received during that period.  Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by recording charges to bad debt expense reported in   Automotive cost of sales  .  Receivables are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is deemed to be uncollectible.   
    
  Net Intangible Assets  
    
  We capitalize and amortize our finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired.  Our intangible assets are comprised primarily of license and advertising agreements, land rights, patents, customer contracts, and technology.  Our indefinite-lived intangibles have been tested for impairment in   2014   and no impairment was required. 
    
  The net carrying amount of our intangible asset was   $133 million   and   $85 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , respectively, and is reported in   Other assets   on our balance sheet.  Amortization was, and is expected to be, less than   $25 million   a year through   2019  .

  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 2.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     (Continued) 
    
  Long-Lived Asset Impairment 
    
   We test long-lived asset groups for recoverability at the operating segment level when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues and expenses, significant underperformance relative to historical and projected future operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends, and a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition.  When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group.  If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the asset group s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow methodology.  An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.  When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over their remaining useful life. 
    
  Revenue Recognition   Automotive Sector 
    
  Automotive revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories.  Revenue is recorded when all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers (generally dealers and distributors).  For the majority of our sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities.  When we give our dealers the right to return eligible parts for credit, we reduce the related revenue for expected returns. 
    
  We sell vehicles to fleet customers, primarily daily rental car companies, subject to guaranteed repurchase options.  These vehicles are accounted for as operating leases.  At the time of sale, the proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue in   Other liabilities and deferred revenue  .  The difference between the proceeds and the guaranteed repurchase amount is recognized in   Automotive revenues   over the term of the lease using a straight line method.  On average, the terms of these leases are   11 months  .  The cost of the vehicle is recorded in   Net investment in operating leases   and the difference between the cost of the vehicle and the estimated auction value is depreciated in   Automotive cost of sales   over the term of the lease.  Proceeds from the sale of the vehicle at auction are recognized in   Automotive revenues   at the time of sale.  
    
  Revenue Recognition   Financial Services Sector 
    
  Financial Services revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables (including direct financing leases) and is recognized using the interest method, including the accretion of certain direct origination costs that are deferred.  Revenue from rental payments received on operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  The accrual of interest on finance receivables and revenue on operating leases is discontinued at the time a receivable or account is determined to be uncollectible. 
    
  Retail and Lease Incentives 
    
  We offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers  customers who choose to finance or lease Ford or Lincoln brand vehicles from Ford Credit.  The estimated cost for these incentives is recorded as a revenue reduction to   Automotive revenues   when the vehicle is sold to the dealer.  See Note   1   for additional information regarding transactions between Automotive and Financial Services sectors.  We pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit on behalf of the retail customer upon acquisition of the retail finance or lease contract to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease rates provided to the retail customer.  The Financial Services sector recognized revenue of   $1.4 billion  ,   $1.5 billion  , and   $1.6 billion   in   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively, for special financing consistent with the earnings process of the underlying receivable, and lower depreciation of   $1.3 billion  ,   $946 million  , and   $850 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively, related to leasing programs.   
    
  Sales and Marketing Incentives 
    
  Sales and marketing incentives generally are recognized by the Automotive sector as revenue reductions in   Automotive revenues  .  The incentives generally take the form of cash payments to dealers and dealers  customers.  The reduction to revenue is accrued at the later of the date the related vehicle is sold or the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated.  We generally estimate these accruals using incentive programs that are approved as of the balance sheet date and are expected to be effective at the beginning of the subsequent period.

  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 2.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     (Continued) 
    
  Supplier Price Adjustments 
    
  We frequently negotiate price adjustments with our suppliers throughout a production cycle, even after receiving production material.  These price adjustments relate to changes in design specifications or other commercial terms such as economics, productivity, and competitive pricing.  We recognize price adjustments when we reach final agreement with our suppliers.  In general, we avoid direct price changes in consideration of future business; however, when these occur, our policy is to defer the financial statement impact of any such price change given explicitly in consideration of future business where guaranteed volumes are specified. 
    
  Raw Material Arrangements 
    
  We may, at times, negotiate prices for and facilitate the purchase of raw materials on behalf of our suppliers.  These raw material arrangements, which take place independently of any purchase orders issued to our suppliers, are negotiated at arms  length and do not involve volume guarantees.  When we pass the risks and rewards of ownership to our suppliers, including inventory risk, market price risk, and credit risk for the raw material, we record both the cost of the raw material and the income from the subsequent sale to the supplier in   Automotive cost of sales  . 
    
  Government Incentives 
    
  We receive incentives from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities in the form of tax rebates or credits, grants, and loans.  Government incentives are recorded in the financial statements in accordance with their purpose, either as a reduction of expense or a reduction of the cost of the capital investment.  A discount is calculated on government loans with a below-market interest rate. The benefit of these incentives generally is recorded when all conditions as specified in the agreement are fulfilled. 
    
  Selected Other Costs 
    
  Engineering, research, and development costs are included in   Automotive cost of sales  ; advertising costs are included in   Selling, administrative, and other expenses  .  Engineering, research, and development costs are expensed as incurred when performed internally or when performed by a supplier if we guarantee reimbursement.  Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  Engineering, research, development, and advertising expenses for the years ended  
  December 31   were as follows (in billions): 

Presentation of Sales and Sales-Related Taxes 
    
  We collect and remit taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a revenue-producing transaction between us and our customers.  These taxes may include, but are not limited to, sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes.  We report the collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from revenues).

NOTE 3.      ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED    
    
  Extraordinary and Unusual Items - Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.    In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued a new accounting standard that eliminates the concept of extraordinary items and their segregation from the results of ordinary operations and expands presentation and disclosure guidance to include items that are both unusual in nature and occur infrequently.  The new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2016 and we are assessing the potential impact to our financial statements and financial statement disclosures. 
    
  Derivatives and Hedging - Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity.    In November 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that requires an entity to determine the nature of the host contract by considering all stated and implied substantive terms and features of the hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share, including any embedded derivative features being evaluated for bifurcation.  The new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2016 and we are assessing the potential impact to our financial statements and financial statement disclosures. 
    
  Going Concern - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.    In August 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that requires management to assess if there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim period.  If conditions or events give rise to substantial doubt, disclosures are required.  The new accounting standard is effective as of December 31, 2016 and we do not expect it to have an impact on our financial statement disclosures. 
    
  Consolidation - Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity.    In August 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that provides an entity the option to elect to measure the financial assets and financial liabilities of a consolidated collateralized financing entity ( CFE ) at a value that is reflective of its economic interest in the CFE.  The new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2016 and we are assessing the potential impact to our financial statements and financial statement disclosures. 
    
  Stock Compensation - Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.    In June 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that requires performance targets that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as performance conditions that affect the vesting of the award.  The new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2016 and we do not expect it to have an impact on our financial statements or financial statement disclosures. 
    
  Transfers and Servicing - Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings and Disclosures.    In June 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and repurchase financing arrangements.  The new standard also requires additional disclosures for certain transfers of financial assets with agreements that both entitle and obligate the transferor to repurchase the transferred assets from the transferee.  The new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2015 and we do not expect it to have an impact on our financial statements or financial statement disclosures. 
    
  Revenue - Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that requires recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard supersedes virtually all present U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition and requires the use of more estimates and judgments than the present standards as well as additional disclosures.  The new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2017 and we are assessing the potential impact to our financial statements and financial statement disclosures.

  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 4.      FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS    
    
  Cash equivalents, marketable securities, and derivative financial instruments are presented on our financial statements on a recurring basis at fair value, while other assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  During 2014, we changed the accounting for our Venezuelan operations from the consolidated method to the cost method (see Note   1  ), and impaired our equity in net assets of Ford Sollers Netherlands B.V. ( Ford Sollers ) (see Note   22  ). 
    
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  In measuring fair value, we use various valuation methodologies and prioritize the use of observable inputs.  The use of observable and unobservable inputs and their significance in measuring fair value are reflected in our fair value hierarchy assessment. 

Level 1 - inputs include quoted prices for identical instruments and are the most observable 
                
    Level 2 - inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments and observable inputs such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, and yield curves 
                
    Level 3 - inputs include data not observable in the market and reflect management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the instruments 
       
  We review the inputs to the fair value measurements to ensure they are appropriately categorized within the fair value hierarchy.  Transfers into and transfers out of the hierarchy levels are recognized as if they had taken place at the end of the reporting period.    
    
  Valuation Methodologies 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents.    Included in   Cash and cash equivalents   are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty on withdrawal.  A debt security is classified as a cash equivalent if it meets these criteria and if it has a remaining time to maturity of   three months or less from the date of acquisition  .  Amounts on deposit and available upon demand, or negotiated to provide for daily liquidity without penalty, are classified as   Cash and cash equivalents  .  Time deposits, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts that meet the above criteria are reported at par value on our balance sheet and are excluded from the tables below. 
    
  Marketable Securities  .  Investments in securities with a   maturity date greater than three months at the date of purchase   and other securities for which there is more than an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty on withdrawal are classified as   Marketable securities  .  We generally measure fair value using prices obtained from pricing services.  Pricing methodologies and inputs to valuation models used by the pricing services depend on the security type (i.e., asset class).  Where possible, fair values are generated using market inputs including quoted prices (the closing price in an exchange market), bid prices (the price at which a buyer stands ready to purchase), and other market information.  For fixed income securities that are not actively traded, the pricing services use alternative methods to determine fair value for the securities, including quotes for similar fixed-income securities, matrix pricing, discounted cash flow using benchmark curves, or other factors.  In certain cases, when market data are not available, we may use broker quotes to determine fair value. 
    
  An annual review is performed on the security prices received from our pricing services, which includes discussion and analysis of the inputs used by the pricing services to value our securities.  We also compare the price of certain securities sold close to the quarter end to the price of the same security at the balance sheet date to ensure the reported fair value is reasonable.    
    
  Realized and unrealized gains and losses and interest income on our marketable securities are recorded in   Automotive interest income and other income/(expense), net   and   Financial Services other income/(loss), net  .  Realized gains and losses are measured using the specific identification method.  
    
  We enter into repurchase agreements from time to time with certain counterparties where we are the transferee.  These agreements allow us to offset our entire gross exposure in the event of default or breach of contract.  The gross value of these assets and liabilities reflected on our balance sheet at   December 31, 2014   and   2013   was   $15 million   and   $228 million  , respectively.

NOTE 4.      FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS     (Continued) 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments.    Our derivatives are over-the-counter customized derivative transactions and are not exchange traded.  We estimate the fair value of these instruments using industry-standard valuation models such as a discounted cash flow.  These models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based expectations for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and the contractual terms of the derivative instruments.  The discount rate used is the relevant interbank deposit rate (e.g., LIBOR) plus an adjustment for non-performance risk.  The adjustment reflects the full credit default swap ( CDS ) spread applied to a net exposure, by counterparty, considering the master netting agreements and any posted collateral.  We use our counterparty s CDS spread when we are in a net asset position and our own CDS spread when we are in a net liability position.  In certain cases, market data is not available and we use broker quotes and models (e.g., Black-Scholes) to determine fair value.  This includes situations where there is lack of liquidity for a particular currency or commodity, or when the instrument is longer dated.   
    
  Finance Receivables.    We measure finance receivables at fair value for purposes of disclosure (see Note   5  ) using internal valuation models.  These models project future cash flows of financing contracts based on scheduled contract payments (including principal and interest).  The projected cash flows are discounted to present value based on assumptions regarding credit losses, pre-payment speed, and applicable spreads to approximate current rates.  Our assumptions regarding pre-payment speed and credit losses are based on historical performance.  The fair value of finance receivables is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy. 
    
  On a nonrecurring basis, we also measure at fair value retail contracts   greater than 120 days past due or deemed to be uncollectible  , and individual dealer loans probable of foreclosure.  We use the fair value of collateral, adjusted for estimated costs to sell, to determine the fair value of our receivables.  The collateral for a retail receivable is the vehicle financed, and for dealer loans is real estate or other property.   
    
  The fair value of collateral for retail receivables is calculated by multiplying the outstanding receivable balances by the average recovery value percentage to determine the fair value adjustment. 
    
  The fair value of collateral for dealer loans is determined by reviewing various appraisals, which include total adjusted appraised value of land and improvements, alternate use appraised value, broker s opinion of value, and purchase offers.  The fair value adjustment is calculated by comparing the net carrying value of the dealer loan and the estimated fair value of collateral. 
    
  Debt.    We measure debt at fair value for purposes of disclosure (see Note   13  ) using quoted prices for our own debt with approximately the same remaining maturities, where possible.  Where quoted prices are not available, we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows and market-based expectations for interest rates, credit risk, and the contractual terms of the debt instruments.  For certain short-term debt with an original maturity date of one year or less, we assume that book value is a reasonable approximation of the debt s fair value.  The fair value of debt is categorized within Level 2 of the hierarchy.

NOTE 5.      FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR FINANCE RECEIVABLES    
    
  Our Financial Services sector finance receivables primarily relate to Ford Credit, but also include the Other Financial Services segment and certain intersector eliminations.   
    
  Our Financial Services sector segments our finance receivables into  consumer  and  non-consumer  portfolios.  The receivables are generally secured by the vehicles, inventory, or other property being financed. 
    
  Finance receivables are recorded at the time of origination or purchase at fair value and are subsequently reported at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses.   
  Consumer Portfolio.    Receivables in this portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of Ford and Lincoln vehicles from dealers for personal or commercial use.  Retail financing includes retail installment contracts for new and used vehicles and direct financing leases with retail customers, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers. 
    
  Non-Consumer Portfolio.    Receivables in this portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers.  The products include: 

Dealer financing     includes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as floorplan financing, as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership real estate, and finance other dealer programs.  Wholesale financing is approximately   94%   of our dealer financing 
                
    Other financing     primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers 
       
  Finance receivables, net at December 31 were as follows (in millions): 

__________ 
           (a)  
    At   December 31, 2014   and   2013  ,   Finance receivables, net   on the consolidated balance sheet were   $81.1 billion   and   $77.5 billion  , respectively. The balance is comprised of Financial Services sector finance receivables of   $86.1 billion   and   $80.8 billion  , respectively, net of   $5 billion   and   $3.3 billion  , respectively, of receivables purchased by Financial Services sector from Automotive sector, which are reclassified to   Other receivables, net. 
               (c)  
    Excludes   $1.7 billion   of certain receivables (primarily direct financing leases) that are not subject to fair value disclosure requirements at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  .  
       
  Excluded from finance receivables at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , was   $191 million   and   $196 million  , respectively, of accrued uncollected interest, which we report in   Other assets   on the balance sheet.

NOTE 5.      FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR FINANCE RECEIVABLES     (Continued) 
    
  Included in the recorded investment in finance receivables at   December 31, 2014   and   2013   were consumer receivables of   $24.4 billion   and   $27.7 billion   and non-consumer receivables of   $21.8 billion   and   $23.9 billion  , respectively, that have been sold for legal purposes in securitization transactions but continue to be reported in our consolidated financial statements.  The receivables are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors.  Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions (see Notes   13     and     15  ). 
    
  Contractual maturities of total finance receivables outstanding at   December 31, 2014   reflect contractual repayments due from customers or borrowers as follows (in millions): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    Contractual maturities of retail financing, gross include   $154 million   of estimated unguaranteed residual values related to direct finance leases 
       
  Our finance receivables are pre-payable without penalty, so prepayments may cause actual maturities to differ from contractual maturities.  The above table, therefore, is not to be regarded as a forecast of future cash collections.  For wholesale receivables, which are included in dealer financing, maturities stated above are estimated based on historical trends, as maturities on outstanding amounts are scheduled upon the sale of the underlying vehicle by the dealer. 
    
  Aging    
    
  For all finance receivables, we define  past due  as   any payment, including principal and interest, that is at least 31 days past the contractual due date  .  The recorded investment of consumer receivables greater than 90 days past due and still accruing interest was   $17 million   and   $14 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , respectively.  The recorded investment of non-consumer receivables greater than 90 days past due and still accruing interest was   $3 million   and   $21 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , respectively.  
    
  The aging analysis of our finance receivables balances at   December 31   was as follows (in millions):

NOTE 5.      FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR FINANCE RECEIVABLES     (Continued) 
    
  Credit Quality 
    
  Consumer Portfolio  .  When originating all classes of consumer receivables, we use a proprietary scoring system that measures the credit quality of the receivables using several factors, such as credit bureau information, consumer credit risk scores (e.g., FICO score), and contract characteristics.  In addition to our proprietary scoring system, we consider other individual consumer factors, such as employment history, financial stability, and capacity to pay.   
    
  Subsequent to origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity.  As each customer develops a payment history, we use an internally-developed behavioral scoring model to assist in determining the best collection strategies which allows us to focus collection activity on higher-risk accounts.  These models are used to refine our risk-based staffing model to ensure collection resources are aligned with portfolio risk. Based on data from this scoring model, contracts are categorized by collection risk.  Our collection models evaluate several factors, including origination characteristics, updated credit bureau data, and payment patterns. 
    
  Credit quality ratings for consumer receivables are based on aging.  Refer to the aging table above. 
    
  Consumer receivables credit quality ratings are as follows: 

Pass       current to 60 days past due    
                
    Special Mention     61 to 120 days past due and in intensified collection status 
                
    Substandard       greater than 120 days past due   and for which the uncollectible portion of the receivables has already been charged off, as measured using the fair value of collateral 
       
  Non-Consumer Portfolio  .  We extend credit to dealers primarily in the form of lines of credit to purchase new Ford and Lincoln vehicles as well as used vehicles.  Payment is required when the dealer has sold the vehicle.  Each non consumer lending request is evaluated by taking into consideration the borrower s financial condition and the underlying collateral securing the loan.  We use a proprietary model to assign each dealer a risk rating.  This model uses historical dealer performance data to identify key factors about a dealer that we consider most significant in predicting a dealer s ability to meet its financial obligations.  We also consider numerous other financial and qualitative factors of the dealer s operations including capitalization and leverage, liquidity and cash flow, profitability, and credit history with ourselves and other creditors. 
    
  Dealers are assigned to one of four groups according to risk ratings as follows: 

Group I     strong to superior financial metrics 
                
    Group II     fair to favorable financial metrics 
                
    Group III     marginal to weak financial metrics 
                
    Group IV     poor financial metrics, including dealers classified as uncollectible 
       
  We generally suspend credit lines and extend no further funding to dealers classified in Group IV. 
    
  We regularly review our model to confirm the continued business significance and statistical predictability of the factors and update the model to incorporate new factors or other information that improves its statistical predictability.  In addition, we regularly audit dealer inventory and dealer sales records to verify that the dealer is in possession of the financed vehicles and is promptly paying each receivable following the sale of the financed vehicle.  The frequency of on-site vehicle inventory audits depends on factors such as the dealer s risk rating and our security position.  Under our policies, on-site vehicle inventory audits of low-risk dealers are conducted only as circumstances warrant.  Audits of higher-risk dealers are conducted with increased frequency based on risk ratings and our security position.  We perform a credit review of each dealer at least annually and adjust the dealer s risk rating, if necessary. 
    
  The credit quality of dealer financing receivables is evaluated based on our internal dealer risk rating analysis.  A dealer has the same risk rating for its entire dealer financing regardless of the type of financing.

NOTE 5.      FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR FINANCE RECEIVABLES     (Continued) 
    
  The credit quality analysis of our dealer financing receivables at   December 31   was as follows (in millions): 

Impaired Receivables.      Impaired consumer receivables include accounts that have been rewritten or modified in reorganization proceedings pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that are considered to be troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ), as well as all accounts   greater than 120 days past due  .  Impaired non-consumer receivables represent accounts with dealers that have weak or poor financial metrics or dealer financing that has been modified in TDRs.  The recorded investment of consumer receivables that were impaired at   December 31, 2014   and   2013   was   $415 million  , or   0.8%   of consumer receivables, and   $435 million  , or   0.9%   of consumer receivables, respectively.  The recorded investment of non-consumer receivables that were impaired at   December 31, 2014   and   2013   was   $105 million  , or   0.3%   of non consumer receivables, and   $71 million  , or   0.2%   of the non-consumer receivables, respectively.  Impaired finance receivables are evaluated both collectively and specifically.  See Note   7   for additional information related to the development of our allowance for credit losses. 
    
  The accrual of revenue is discontinued at the time a receivable is determined to be uncollectible.  Accounts may be restored to accrual status only when a customer settles all past-due deficiency balances and future payments are reasonably assured.  For receivables in non-accrual status, subsequent financing revenue is recognized only to the extent a payment is received.  Payments are generally applied first to outstanding interest and then to the unpaid principal balance.   
    
  A restructuring of debt constitutes a TDR if we grant a concession to a debtor for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties that we otherwise would not consider.  Consumer and non-consumer receivables that have a modified interest rate below market rate or that were modified in reorganization proceedings pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, except non-consumer receivables that are current with minimal risk of loss, are considered to be TDRs.  We do not grant concessions on the principal balance of our receivables.  If a receivable is modified in a reorganization proceeding, all payment requirements of the reorganization plan need to be met before remaining balances are forgiven.  Finance receivables involved in TDRs are specifically assessed for impairment.  
    
    NOTE 6.      NET INVESTMENT IN OPERATING LEASES    
    
  Net investment in operating leases   on our balance sheet consists primarily of lease contracts for vehicles with retail customers, daily rental companies, government entities, and fleet customers.  Assets subject to operating leases are depreciated using the straight-line method over the term of the lease to reduce the asset to its estimated residual value.  Estimated residual values are based on assumptions for used vehicle prices at lease termination and the number of vehicles that are expected to be returned. 
    
  The net investment in operating leases at December 31 was as follows (in millions): 

__________ 
           (a) 
    Includes Ford Credit s operating lease assets of   $9.6 billion   and   $8.1 billion   at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , respectively, for which the related cash flows have been used to secure certain lease securitization transactions.  Cash flows associated with the net investment in operating leases are available only for payment of the debt or other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions; they are not available to pay other obligations or the claims of other creditors.

NOTE 7.      FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES    
    
  The allowance for credit losses represents our estimate of the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date.  The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly.  Because credit losses may vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain.  The majority of credit losses are attributable to Ford Credit s consumer receivables portfolio.   
    
  Additions to the allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges to   Provision for credit and insurance losses   on the sector income statement.  The uncollectible portion of finance receivables are charged to the allowance for credit losses at the earlier of   when an account is deemed to be uncollectible or when an account is 120 days delinquent  , taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer, borrower, or lessee, the value of the collateral, recourse to guarantors, and other factors.  In the event we repossess the collateral, the receivable is charged off and we record the collateral at its estimated fair value less costs to sell and report it in   Other assets   on the balance sheet.  Recoveries on finance receivables previously charged off as uncollectible, are credited to the allowance for credit losses. 
    
  Consumer  
    
  We estimate the allowance for credit losses on our consumer receivables using a combination of measurement models and management judgment.  The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses and recoveries (including key metrics such as delinquencies, repossessions, and bankruptcies), the composition of the present portfolio (including vehicle brand, term, risk evaluation, and new/used vehicles), trends in historical used vehicle values, and economic conditions.  Estimates from these models rely on historical information and may not fully reflect losses inherent in the present portfolio.  Therefore, we may adjust the estimate to reflect management judgment regarding observable changes in recent economic trends and conditions, portfolio composition, and other relevant factors. 
    
  We make projections of two key assumptions to assist in estimating the consumer allowance for credit losses: 

Frequency - number of finance receivables contracts that are expected to default over the loss emergence period, measured as repossessions 
                
    Loss severity - expected difference between the amount of money a customer owes when the finance contract is charged off and the amount received, net of expenses from selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the customer 
       
  Collective Allowance for Credit Losses.    The collective allowance is evaluated primarily using a collective loss to receivables ( LTR ) model that, based on historical experience, indicates credit losses have been incurred in the portfolio even though the particular accounts that are uncollectible cannot be specifically identified.  The LTR model is based on the most recent years of history.  Each LTR is calculated by dividing credit losses by average end-of-period finance receivables excluding unearned interest supplements and allowance for credit losses.  An average LTR is calculated for each product and multiplied by the end-of-period balances for that given product.

NOTE 7.      FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES     (Continued) 
    
  Our largest markets also use a projection model to estimate losses inherent in the portfolio.  The loss projection model applies recent monthly performance metrics, stratified by contract type (retail or lease), contract term (e.g.,   60  -month), and  risk rating to our active portfolio to estimate the losses that have been incurred. 
    
  The loss emergence period ( LEP ) is a key assumption within our models and represents the average amount of time between when a loss event first occurs and when it is charged off.  This time period starts when the consumer begins to experience financial difficulty.  It is evidenced, typically through delinquency, before eventually resulting in a charge-off.  The LEP is a multiplier in the calculation of the collective consumer allowance for credit losses. 
    
  For accounts   greater than 120 days past due  , the uncollectible portion is charged off such that the remaining recorded investment is equal to the estimated fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. 
    
  Specific Allowance for Impaired Receivables  .  Consumer receivables involved in TDRs are specifically assessed for impairment.  A specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the receivable discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of any collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell.   
    
  After establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit losses, if management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions, or other relevant factors, an adjustment is made based on management judgment. 
    
  Non-Consumer  
    
  We estimate the allowance for credit losses for non-consumer receivables based on historical LTR ratios, expected future cash flows, and the fair value of collateral.   
    
  Collective Allowance for Credit Losses  .  We estimate an allowance for non-consumer receivables that are not specifically identified as impaired using a LTR model for each financing product based on historical experience.  This LTR is an average of the most recent historical experience and is calculated consistent with the consumer receivables LTR approach.  All accounts that are specifically identified as impaired are excluded from the calculation of the non-specific or collective allowance.  
    
  Specific Allowance for Impaired Receivables  .  Dealer financing is evaluated by segmenting individual loans by the risk characteristics of the loan (such as the amount of the loan, the nature of the collateral, and the financial status of the debtor).  The loans are analyzed to determine whether individual loans are impaired, and a specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the receivable discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell. 
    
  After establishing the collective and the specific allowance for credit losses, if management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions, or other relevant factors, an adjustment is made based on management judgment.

NOTE 12.      RETIREMENT BENEFITS    
    
  We, and certain of our subsidiaries, provide retirement benefits including the following:  
    
  Defined Benefit Pension Plans.    We have defined benefit pension plans in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and other locations covering hourly and salaried employees. The largest portion of our worldwide obligation is associated with our U.S. plans. The vast majority of our worldwide defined benefit plans are closed to new participants.  
    
  In general, our defined benefit pension plans are funded (i.e., have restricted assets from which benefits are paid).  Our unfunded defined benefit pension plans are treated on a  pay as you go  basis with benefit payments from general Company cash. These unfunded plans primarily include certain plans in Germany and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management.   
    
  OPEB  .  We have defined benefit OPEB plans, primarily certain health care and life insurance benefits, in the United States, Canada, and other locations covering hourly and salaried employees.  The largest portion of our worldwide obligation is associated with our U.S. plans.  Our OPEB plans are unfunded and the benefits are paid from general Company cash.  
    
  Defined Contribution and Savings Plans  .  We also have defined contribution and savings plans in the United States and other locations for hourly and salaried employees.  Contributions to these plans, if any, are made from general Company cash and are expensed as incurred.  The expense for our worldwide defined contribution and savings plans was   $276 million  ,   $238 million  , and   $181 million   for the years ended December 31,   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively.  This includes the expense for Company-matching contributions to our primary employee savings plan in the United States of   $114 million  ,   $99 million  , and   $70 million   for the years ended December 31,   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively.   
    
  Defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations are measured based on the present value of projected future benefit payments for all participants for services rendered to date.  The measurement of projected future benefits is dependent on the provisions of each specific plan, demographics of the group covered by the plan, and other key measurement assumptions.  For plans that provide benefits dependent on salary assumptions, we include a projection of salary growth in our measurements.  No assumption is made regarding any potential changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts). 
    
  The net periodic benefit costs associated with the Company s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are determined using assumptions regarding the benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets (where applicable) as of the beginning of each year.  We have elected to use a market-related value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets in net periodic benefit costs.  The market-related value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over   five   years.  Net periodic benefit costs are recorded in   Automotive cost of sales   and   Selling, administrative, and other expenses  .  The funded status of the benefit plans, which represents the difference between the benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, is calculated on a plan-by-plan basis.  The benefit obligation and related funded status are determined using assumptions as of the end of each year.  The impact of plan amendments and actuarial gains and losses are recorded in   Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)  ,     and generally are amortized as a component of net periodic cost over the remaining service period of our active employees.  Unamortized gains and losses are amortized only to the extent they exceed   10%   of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the benefit obligation of the respective plan (i.e., outside of corridor). 
    
  Curtailment gains or losses are recorded when an event occurs that significantly reduces the expected years of future service or eliminates the accrual of defined benefits for the future services of a significant number of employees.  We record a curtailment gain when the employees who are entitled to the benefits terminate their employment; we record a curtailment loss when it becomes probable a loss will occur.  Upon a settlement, we recognize the proportionate amount of the unamortized gains and losses if the cost of all settlements during the year exceeds the interest component of net periodic cost for the affected plan.  Expense from curtailments and settlements is recorded in   Automotive cost of sales   and   Selling, administrative, and other expenses  .

  Pension Plan Contributions 
    
  Our policy for funded pension plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts required by applicable laws and regulations.  We may make contributions beyond those legally required. 
    
  In   2014  , we contributed   $1.5 billion   to our worldwide funded pension plans (most of which were mandatory contributions) and made about   $400 million   of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans.  During   2015  , we expect to contribute about   $1.1 billion   from Automotive cash and cash equivalents to our worldwide funded pension plans (most of which are mandatory contributions) and to make about   $400 million   of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans, for a total of about   $1.5 billion  .  Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to contribute to our major U.S. pension plans in   2015  . 
    
  Curtailments and Settlements 
    
  In April 2012, we announced a program to offer voluntary lump-sum pension payout options to eligible salaried U.S. retirees and former salaried employees that, if accepted, would settle our obligation to them.  The program provided participants with a one-time choice of electing to receive a lump-sum settlement of their remaining pension benefit.  As part of this voluntary lump-sum program, the Company settled   $4.2 billion   of its pension obligations for U.S. salaried retirees (  $1.2 billion   in 2012 and   $3 billion   in 2013) with an equal amount paid from plan assets.  As a result, we recorded settlement losses of   $844 million   (  $250 million   in 2012 and   $594 million   in 2013) reflecting the accelerated recognition of unamortized losses in the salaried plan proportionate to the obligation that was settled.  These settlement charges were recorded in   Automotive cost of sales   and   Selling, administrative, and other expenses   with a corresponding balance sheet reduction in   Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)  . 
    
  Separation Programs  
    
  As a result of various employee separation programs, primarily in Europe, we have recognized pension-related expense in the periods presented.  See Note   20   for additional information.

  Pension Plan Asset Information 
    
  Investment Objective and Strategies  .  Our investment objectives for the U.S. plans are to minimize the volatility of the value of our U.S.     pension assets relative to U.S. pension obligations and to ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits.  In 2012 we adopted a broad global pension de-risking strategy, including a U.S. investment strategy that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligations.  Our U.S. target asset allocations, which we expect to reach over the next few years as the plans achieve full funding, are   80%   fixed income and   20%   growth assets (primarily alternative investments which include hedge funds, real estate, and private equity, and public equity).  Our largest non-U.S. plans (United Kingdom and Canada) have similar investment objectives to the U.S. plans.  We expect to reach similar target asset allocations for these plans as they achieve full funding over the next few years, subject to legal requirements in each country. 
    
  Investment strategies and policies for the U.S. plans and the largest non-U.S. plans reflect a balance of risk-reducing and return-seeking considerations.  The objective of minimizing the volatility of assets relative to obligations is addressed primarily through asset - liability matching, asset diversification, and hedging.  The fixed income target asset allocation matches the bond-like and long-dated nature of the pension obligations.  Assets are broadly diversified within asset classes to achieve risk-adjusted returns that in total lower asset volatility relative to the obligations.  Our rebalancing policies ensure actual allocations are in line with target allocations as appropriate.  Strategies to address the goal of ensuring sufficient assets to pay benefits include target allocations to a broad array of asset classes, and strategies within asset classes that provide adequate returns, diversification, and liquidity. 
    
  All assets are externally managed and most assets are actively managed.  Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g., fixed income, public equity, alternatives) or strategy for which they have been appointed.  We use investment guidelines and recurring audits as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. 
    
  Derivatives are permitted for fixed income investment and public equity managers to use as efficient substitutes for traditional securities and to manage exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks.  Interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments are used for the purpose of hedging changes in the fair value of assets that result from interest rate changes and currency fluctuations.  Interest rate derivatives also are used to adjust portfolio duration.  Derivatives may not be used to leverage or to alter the economic exposure to an asset class outside the scope of the mandate an investment manager has been given.  Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage (including through the use of derivatives or other tools) that may alter economic exposure. 
    
  Significant Concentrations of Risk.    Significant concentrations of risk in our plan assets relate to interest rate, equity, and operating risk.  In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the obligations, the majority of plan assets are allocated to fixed income investments which are exposed to interest rate risk.  Rate increases generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets, while reducing the present value of the obligations.  Conversely, rate decreases generally will increase the value of fixed income assets, offsetting the related increase in the obligations. 
    
  In order to ensure assets are sufficient to pay benefits, a portion of plan assets is allocated to growth assets that are expected over time to earn higher returns with more volatility than fixed income investments which more closely match pension obligations.  Within equities, risk is mitigated by constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style, and process.  Within alternative investments, risk is similarly mitigated by constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by asset class, investment strategy, manager, style, and process. 
    
  Operating risks include the risks of inadequate diversification and weak controls.  To mitigate these risks, investments are diversified across and within asset classes in support of investment objectives.  Policies and practices to address operating risks include ongoing manager oversight (e.g., style adherence, team strength, firm health, and internal risk controls), plan and asset class investment guidelines and instructions that are communicated to managers, and periodic compliance and audit reviews to ensure adherence. 
    
   At year-end   2014  , Ford securities comprised less than   1%   of our plan assets.

  Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets.    The long-term return assumption at year-end   2014   is   6.75%   for the U.S. plans,   6.5%   for the U.K. plans, and   5.94%   for the Canadian plans, and averages   6.11%   for all non-U.S. plans.  A generally consistent approach is used worldwide to develop this assumption.  This approach considers various sources, primarily inputs from a range of advisors for long-term capital market returns, inflation, bond yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan.  Historical returns also are considered where appropriate. 
    
  At   December 31, 2014  , our actual   10  -year annual rate of return on pension plan assets was   9.3%   for the U.S. plans,   8.3%   for the U.K. plans, and   6.2%   for the Canadian plans.  At   December 31, 2013  , our actual   10  -year annual rate of return on pension plan assets was   9%   for the U.S. plans,   7.7%   for the U.K. plans, and   5.8%   for the Canadian plans. 
    
  Fair Value of Plan Assets.    Pension assets are recorded at fair value, and include primarily fixed income and equity securities, derivatives, and alternative investments, which include hedge funds, private equity, and real estate.  Fixed income and equity securities may each be combined into commingled fund investments.  Commingled funds are valued to reflect the pension fund s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value ( NAV ).  Alternative investments are valued based on year-end reported NAV, with adjustments as appropriate for lagged reporting of   1   month to   6   months. 
    
  Fixed Income - Government and Agency Debt Securities and Corporate Debt Securities.    U.S. government and government agency obligations, non-U.S. government and government agency obligations, municipal securities, supranational obligations, corporate bonds, bank notes, floating rate notes, and preferred securities are valued based on quotes received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities.  Pricing services utilize matrix pricing, which considers readily available inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity, and type, as well as dealer-supplied prices, and generally are categorized as Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.  Securities categorized as Level 3 typically are priced by dealers and pricing services that use proprietary pricing models which incorporate unobservable inputs.  These inputs primarily consist of yield and credit spread assumptions. 
    
  Fixed Income - Agency and Non-Agency Mortgage and Other Asset-Backed Securities.    U.S. and non U.S. government agency mortgage and asset-backed securities, non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage securities, residential mortgage securities, and other asset-backed securities are valued based on quotes received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities.  Pricing services utilize matrix pricing, which considers prepayment speed assumptions, attributes of the collateral, yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type, as well as dealer-supplied prices, and generally are categorized as Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.  Securities categorized as Level 3 typically are priced by dealers and pricing services that use proprietary pricing models which incorporate unobservable inputs.  These inputs primarily consist of prepayment curves, discount rates, default assumptions, and recovery rates. 
    
  Equities.    Equity securities are valued based on quoted prices and are primarily exchange-traded.  Securities for which official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange is available are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.  If closing prices are not available, securities are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and typically are categorized as Level 2.  Level 3 securities often are thinly traded or delisted, with unobservable pricing data. 
    
  Derivatives.    Exchange-traded derivatives for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are categorized as Level 1.  Over-the-counter derivatives typically are valued by independent pricing services and categorized as Level 2.  Level 3 derivatives typically are priced by dealers and pricing services that use proprietary pricing models which incorporate unobservable inputs, including extrapolated or model derived assumptions such as volatilities and yield and credit spread assumptions. 
    
  Alternative Assets.      Hedge funds generally hold liquid and readily-priced securities, such as public equities, exchange-traded derivatives, and corporate bonds.      Since hedge funds do not have readily-available market quotations, they are valued using the NAV provided by the investment sponsor or third party administrator.  Hedge fund assets typically are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to the inherent restrictions on redemptions that may affect our ability to sell the investment at its NAV in the near term.  Valuations may be lagged   1   month to   3   months.  For   2014   and   2013  , we made adjustments of   $14 million   and   $(10) million  , respectively, to adjust for hedge fund-lagged valuations.

  Private equity and real estate investments are less liquid.  External investment managers typically report valuations reflecting initial cost or updated appraisals, which are adjusted for cash flows, and realized and unrealized gains/losses.  Private equity and real estate funds do not have readily available market quotations, and therefore are valued using the NAV provided by the investment sponsor or third party administrator.  These assets typically are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, due to the inherent restrictions on redemptions that may affect our ability to sell the investment at its NAV in the near term.  Valuations may be lagged   1   month to   6   months.  The NAV will be adjusted for cash flows (additional investments or contributions, and distributions) through year-end.  We may make further adjustments for any known substantive valuation changes not reflected in the NAV.  For   2014   and   2013  , we made adjustments of   $88 million   and   $123 million  , respectively, to adjust for private equity-lagged valuations.  For   2014   and   2013  , we made adjustments of   $33 million   and   $0  , respectively, to adjust for real estate-lagged valuations. 
    
  The Ford-Werke GmbH ( Ford-Werke ) funded defined benefit plan is funded through a group insurance contract and exists in a pooled structure with other policy holders.  The contract value represents the value of the underlying assets held by the insurance company (primarily bonds) at the guaranteed rate of return.  The adjustment to fair value to recognize contractual returns is a significant unobservable input; therefore the contract is Level 3.

  DOE ATVM Incentive Program 
    
  In September 2009, we entered into a Loan Arrangement and Reimbursement Agreement with the DOE, under which we borrowed through multiple draws   $5.9 billion   to finance certain costs for fuel-efficient, advanced-technology vehicles.  At December 31, 2014, an aggregate   $4.4 billion   was outstanding.  The principal amount of the ATVM loan bears interest at a blended rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time each draw was made (with the weighted-average interest rate on all such draws being about   2.3%   per annum).  The ATVM loan is repayable in equal   quarterly   installments of   $148 million  , which began in   September 2012   and will end in June 2022. 
    
  EIB Credit Facilities 
    
  On December 21, 2009, Ford Romania, our operating subsidiary in Romania, entered into a credit facility for an aggregate amount of    400 million   (equivalent to   $486 million   at   December 31, 2014  ) with the EIB (the  EIB Romania Facility ), and on July 12, 2010, Ford Motor Company Limited, our operating subsidiary in the United Kingdom, entered into a credit facility for an aggregate amount of    450 million   (equivalent to   $701 million   at   December 31, 2014  ) with the EIB (the  EIB United Kingdom Facility ).  The facilities were fully drawn at December 31, 2014.  Loans under the EIB Romania Facility and the EIB United Kingdom Facility bear interest at a fixed rate of   4.44%   and   4%   per annum, respectively, and mature on March 31, 2015 and September 11, 2015, respectively.  
    
  Automotive Credit Facilities 
    
  Lenders under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2014 (the  revolving credit facility ) have commitments to us totaling   $12.2 billion  , with about   $9 billion   maturing on April 30, 2019 and about   $3 billion   maturing on April 30, 2017.  We have allocated   $2 billion   of commitments to Ford Credit on an irrevocable and exclusive basis to support its liquidity.  Any borrowings by Ford Credit under the revolving credit facility would be guaranteed by us.   
    
  The revolving credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding.  The revolving credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of   $4 billion   in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the revolving credit facility.  If our senior, unsecured, long term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P, the guarantees of certain subsidiaries will be required. 
    
  At   December 31, 2014  , the utilized portion of the revolving credit facility was   $58 million  , representing amounts utilized as letters of credit.  
    
  At   December 31, 2014  , we had   $822 million   of local credit facilities available to non-U.S. Automotive affiliates, of which   $175 million   had been utilized.

  Asset-Backed Debt 
    
  At December 31, 2014, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was   $43.3 billion  .  This secured debt is issued by Ford Credit and includes asset-backed securities used to fund operations and maintain liquidity.  Assets securing the related debt issued as part of all our securitization transactions are included in our consolidated results and are based upon the legal transfer of the underlying assets in order to reflect legal ownership and the beneficial ownership of the debt holder.  The third-party investors in the securitization transactions have legal recourse only to the assets securing the debt and do not have such recourse to us, except for the customary representation and warranty provisions or when we are counterparty to certain derivative transactions of the special purpose entities ( SPEs ).  In addition, the cash flows generated by the assets are restricted only to pay such liabilities; Ford Credit retains the right to residual cash flows.  See Note   15   for additional information. 
    
  Although not contractually required, we regularly support our wholesale securitization programs by repurchasing receivables of a dealer from a SPE when the dealer s performance is at risk, which transfers the corresponding risk of loss from the SPE to us.  In order to continue to fund the wholesale receivables, we also may contribute additional cash or wholesale receivables if the collateral falls below required levels.  The balances of cash related to these contributions were   $0   at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and ranged from   $0   to   $242 million   during 2014 and   $0   to   $177 million   during 2013. 
    
  SPEs that are exposed to interest rate or currency risk have reduced their risks by entering into derivative transactions.  In certain instances, we have entered into offsetting derivative transactions with the SPE to protect the SPE from the risks that are not mitigated through the derivative transactions between the SPE and its external counterparty.  In other instances, we have entered into derivative transactions with the counterparty to protect the counterparty from risks absorbed through derivative transactions with the SPEs.  Derivative expense/(income) related to the derivative transactions that support Ford Credit     s securitization programs were   $(4) million  ,   $25 million  , and   $239 million   for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  See Note   16   for additional information regarding the accounting for derivatives. 
    
  Interest expense on securitization debt was   $595 million  ,   $640 million  , and   $854 million   in   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively. 
    
  The assets and liabilities related to our asset-backed debt arrangements included on our financial statements at December 31 were as follows (in billions): 

Committed Credit Facilities 
    
  At December 31, 2014, Ford Credit s committed capacity totaled   $37.3 billion   of which   $21.6 billion   is available for use.  Ford Credit s committed capacity is primarily comprised of unsecured credit facilities with financial institutions, committed asset-backed security lines from bank-sponsored commercial paper conduits and other financial institutions, and allocated commitments under the revolving credit facility.

NOTE 14.      REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST    
    
  AutoAlliance International, Inc. ( AAI ) was a   50  /  50   joint venture between Ford and Mazda Motor Corporation ( Mazda ) that owned an automobile assembly plant in Flat Rock, Michigan.  On September 1, 2012, we granted to Mazda a put option to sell and received from Mazda a call option to purchase the   50%   equity interest in AAI that was held by Mazda ( the Option ).  The Option was exercisable at a price of   $339 million   and was recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the mezzanine section of our balance sheet. 
    
  In January 2015, Mazda exercised its put option.  Ford purchased Mazda's   50%   equity interest at the exercise price plus accrued interest and dissolved AAI.  
    
  The change in our carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest for the years ended   December 31   was as follows (in millions): 

_______ 
           (a) 
    For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively,   $10 million   and   $9 million   were recognized in   Interest expense   and   $4 million   and   $0   were recognized in   Income/(Loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.

    NOTE 15.      VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES    
    
  A VIE is an entity that either (i) has insufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (ii) has equity investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  We consolidate VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary.  We consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  Assets recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets.  Conversely, liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional claims on our general assets; rather, they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated VIEs. 
    
  We have the power to direct the significant activities of an entity when our management has the ability to make key operating decisions, such as decisions regarding capital or product investment or manufacturing production schedules.  For securitization entities, we have the power to direct significant activities when we have the ability to exercise discretion in the servicing of financial assets (including general collection activity on current and noncurrent accounts and loss mitigation efforts including repossession and sale of collateral), issue additional debt, exercise a unilateral call option, add assets to revolving structures, or control investment decisions. 
    
  VIEs of Which We are Not the Primary Beneficiary 
    
  Certain of our joint ventures are VIEs, in which the power to direct economically significant activities is shared with the joint venture partner. Our investments in these joint ventures are accounted for as equity method investments.  Our maximum exposure to any potential losses associated with these joint ventures is limited to our investment, including loans, and was   $307 million   and   $336 million   at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively

  VIEs of Which We are the Primary Beneficiary 
    
  Securitization Entities.    Through Ford Credit, we securitize, transfer, and service financial assets associated with consumer finance receivables, operating leases, and wholesale loans. Our securitization transactions typically involve the legal transfer of financial assets to bankruptcy remote SPEs.  We generally retain economic interests in the asset-backed securitization transactions, which are retained in the form of senior or subordinated interests, cash reserve accounts, residual interests, and servicing rights.  For accounting purposes, we are precluded from recording the transfers of assets in securitization transactions as sales.  
    
  In most cases, the bankruptcy remote SPEs meet the definition of VIEs for which we have determined we have both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity that could be significant, and would therefore also be consolidated. We account for all securitization transactions as if they were secured financing and therefore the assets, liabilities, and related activity of these transactions are consolidated in our financial results and are included in amounts presented on the face of our consolidated balance sheet.  See Note   13   for additional information on the accounting for asset-backed debt and the assets securing this debt.  
    
    NOTE 16.      DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES    
    
  In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, certain commodity prices, and interest rates.  To manage these risks, we enter into various derivatives contracts: 

Foreign currency exchange contracts, including forwards, that are used to manage foreign exchange exposure;   
                
    Commodity contracts, including forwards and options, that are used to manage commodity price risk;   
                
    Interest rate contracts, including swaps, that are used to manage the effects of interest rate fluctuations; and   
                
    Cross-currency interest rate swap contracts that are used to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposures on foreign-denominated debt.   
       
  Our derivatives are over-the-counter customized derivative transactions and are not exchange-traded.  We review our hedging program, derivative positions, and overall risk management strategy on a regular basis.  
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting.    Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and presented on a gross basis.  Derivative assets are reported in   Other assets   and derivative liabilities are reported in   Payables   and   Other liabilities and deferred revenue. 
    
  We have elected to apply hedge accounting to certain derivatives.  Derivatives that are designated in hedging relationships are evaluated for effectiveness using regression analysis at the time they are designated and throughout the hedge period.   
    
  Some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting; for others, we elect not to apply hedge accounting.  Regardless, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying economic risk.   
    
  Cash Flow Hedges.    Our Automotive sector has designated certain forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions with exposure to foreign currency exchange and commodity price risks. 
    
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is deferred in   Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)   and is recognized in   Automotive cost of sales   when the hedged item affects earnings.  The ineffective portion is reported in   Automotive cost of sales   in the period of measurement.  Our policy is to de-designate foreign currency exchange cash flow hedges prior to the time forecasted transactions are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and report subsequent changes in fair value through   Automotive cost of sales  .  If it becomes probable that the originally-forecasted transaction will not occur, the related amount included in   Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)   is reclassified and recognized in earnings.  The majority of our cash flow hedges mature in   two   years or less.

NOTE 16.      DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES     (Continued) 
    
  Fair Value Hedges.    Our Financial Services sector     uses derivatives to reduce the risk of changes in the fair value of debt.  We have designated certain receive-fixed, pay-float interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt.  The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate.  If the hedge relationship is deemed to be highly effective, we record the changes in the fair value of the hedged debt related to the risk being hedged in   Financial Services debt   with the offset in   Financial Services other  
  income/(loss), net  .      The change in fair value of the related derivative (excluding accrued interest) also is recorded in   Financial Services other income/(loss), net.    Net interest settlements and accruals on fair value hedges are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are reported in   Interest expense  .  The cash flows associated with fair value hedges are reported in   Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities   on our statement of cash flows.  
    
  When a fair value hedge is de-designated, or when the derivative is terminated before maturity, the fair value adjustment to the hedged debt continues to be reported as part of the carrying value of the debt and is amortized over its remaining life.

NOTE 19.      SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION    
    
  At   December 31, 2014  , a variety of share-based compensation grants and awards were outstanding for employees (including officers).  All share-based compensation plans are approved by our shareholders. 
    
  We have share-based compensation outstanding under three Long-Term Incentive Plans ( LTIP ):  the 1998 LTIP, the 2008 LTIP, and the 2014 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors ( 2014 Plan ).  No further grants may be made under the 1998 LTIP.  All outstanding share-based compensation under the 1998 LTIP continues to be governed by the terms and conditions of the existing agreements for those grants.  Grants may continue to be made under the 2008 LTIP through April 2018.  Under the 2008 LTIP, the number of shares of Common Stock that may be granted as share-based compensation in any year is limited to   2%   of our issued and outstanding Common Stock as of   December 31   of the prior calendar year.  Any unused portion is available for later years.  The limit may be increased up to   3%   in any year, with a corresponding reduction in shares available for grants in future years.  At   December 31, 2014  , the number of unused shares carried forward was   279 million   shares.  Grants may continue to be made under the 2014 Plan through December 2023.  Grants under the 2014 Plan are typically made on the third Thursday in May of each year.  Pursuant to the 2014 Plan, the number of shares of Common Stock that may be granted is   10 million   shares. 
    
  We primarily issue two types of share-based compensation awards: restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and stock options. 
    
  We grant time-based and performance-based RSUs to our employees.  RSUs provide the recipients with the right to shares of Common Stock after a restriction period.  We measure the fair value using the closing price of our Common Stock on grant date.   
    
  Time-based RSUs generally have a graded vesting feature whereby   one-third   of each grant of RSUs vests after the first anniversary of the grant date,   one-third   after the second anniversary, and   one-third   after the third anniversary.  Performance-based RSUs have a performance period (usually   one year  ) followed by a restriction period (usually   two   years).

NOTE 19.      SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION     (Continued) 
    
  Under the 2014 Plan, RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest immediately at grant date and shares of Common Stock are issued either immediately or at a subsequent specified date five years after grant or at separation.  Directors are required to serve the entire calendar year in order to retain the entire grant for that year; otherwise a prorated award will be determined.  
    
  We also grant stock options to our employees.  We measure the fair value of our stock options using the Black Scholes option-pricing model, using historical volatility and our determination of the expected term.  The expected term of stock options is the time period that the stock options are expected to be outstanding.  Historical data are used to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee termination experience. 
    
  Stock options generally have a vesting feature whereby   one-third   of each grant of stock options are exercisable after the first anniversary of the grant date, an additional   one-third   after the second anniversary, and the final   one-third   after the third anniversary.  Stock options expire   10   years from the grant date. 
    
  Expense for RSUs and stock options is recorded in   Selling, administrative, and other expense   and is based on the fair value at grant date.  RSU and stock option expense is recognized using the graded vesting method over the shorter of the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement.  Performance-based RSU expense is recognized when it is probable and estimable as measured against the performance metrics over the performance and restriction periods, if any.   
    
  We measure the intrinsic value of RSUs and stock options by comparing the award price to the closing stock price at   December 31  .   
    
  We issue new shares of Common Stock upon vesting of RSUs and upon exercise of stock options.

We expect   12.1 million   stock options (after forfeitures), with a weighted-average exercise price of   $14.13   and average remaining term of   8.5 years  , to vest in the future.  The intrinsic value for vested and unvested options was   $344 million   and   $18 million  , respectively, for the year ended   December 31, 2014  .   
    
  We received approximately   $173 million   in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in   2014  .  The tax benefit realized was   $10 million  .  An equivalent of about   $324 million   in new issues were used to settle exercised options.  For options exercised during the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , the difference between the fair value of the Common Stock issued and the respective exercise price was   $151 million  ,   $188 million  , and   $44 million  , respectively.

NOTE 20.      EMPLOYEE SEPARATION ACTIONS AND EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES    
    
  We record costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance, unless the acceptance requires explicit approval by the Company.  We record costs associated with involuntary separation programs when management has approved the plan for separation, the affected employees are identified, and it is unlikely that actions required to complete the separation plan will change significantly.  When a plan of separation requires approval by or consultation with the relevant labor organization or government, the costs are recorded after the required approval or consultation process is complete.  Costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period. 
    
  Additionally, under certain labor agreements, we are required to pay transitional benefits to our employees who are idled.  For employees who will be temporarily idled, we expense the benefits on an as-incurred basis.  For employees who will be permanently idled, we expense all of the future benefits payments in the period when it is probable that the employees will be permanently idled.  Our reserve balance for these future benefit payments to permanently idled employees takes into account several factors:  the demographics of the population at each affected facility, redeployment alternatives, estimate of benefits to be paid, and recent experience relative to voluntary redeployments.

  Business Restructuring - Europe 
    
  In October 2012, we committed to commence a transformation plan for our Europe operations.  As part of this plan, we closed two manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom in 2013 and closed our assembly plant in Genk, Belgium at the end of 2014.

In August 2013, a two-phase separation plan was approved, which included a line speed reduction in June 2014, ahead of the final closure. The costs related to the line speed reduction were recorded throughout 2014.  The costs related to the final closure were recorded beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 after the Enterprise bargaining agreement was agreed and ratified by the local government and we determined these payments were probable. 
    
  Separation-related costs recorded in   Automotive cost of sales   and   Selling, administrative and other expenses,   include both the costs associated with voluntary separation programs, and involuntary employee actions in Australia.

  Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 
    
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis.  We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. 
    
  Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our financial statements or tax returns and their future probability.  In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets.  If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance.

We do not recognize deferred tax assets related to stock investments in affiliates until it becomes apparent they will be realized in the foreseeable future.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, we restructured certain of our European affiliates.  We made tax elections to include the operating results of these affiliates in our U.S. tax returns.  As a result, we realized tax benefits related to stock investments in these European affiliates and recorded deferred tax assets of   $1.5 billion  .

  At   December 31, 2014  ,   $4.3 billion   of non-U.S. earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States, for which deferred taxes have not been provided.  Repatriation of these earnings in their entirety would result in a residual U.S. tax liability of about   $200 million  .  Our measure of the amount of non-U.S. earnings considered indefinitely reinvested in operations outside of the United States reflects accumulated earnings determined under U.S. tax law.  The reduction in these indefinitely reinvested earnings from year-end 2013 is primarily due to a change in our methodology for measuring currency gains and losses in computing the earnings of our European operations under U.S. tax law. 
    
  Components of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 were as follows (in millions): 

At   December 31, 2014  , we have a valuation allowance of   $1.6 billion   primarily for deferred tax assets related to our South America operations.  
    
  Operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes were   $7.2 billion   at   December 31, 2014  , resulting in a deferred tax asset of   $2.6 billion  .  There is no expiration date for   $6 billion   of these losses.  The remaining losses begin to expire in 2015, though a substantial portion expire beyond 2017.  Tax credits available to offset future tax liabilities are   $6.8 billion  .  A substantial portion of these credits have a remaining carryforward period of   10   years or more.  Tax benefits of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances.

  Examinations by tax authorities have been completed through 2004 in Germany, 2007 in Canada and the United Kingdom, and 2009 in the United States.  Although examinations have been completed in these jurisdictions, limited transfer pricing disputes exist for years dating back to 1996.

As of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , we had recorded a net receivable of   $23 million   and a net payable of   $83 million  , respectively, for tax-related interest.

    NOTE 22.      CHANGES IN INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE    
    
  We classify assets and liabilities as held for sale ( disposal group ) when management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group, the sale is probable within one year, and the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.  We also consider whether an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated, whether the disposal group is marketed actively for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and whether actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.  We classify a disposal group as a discontinued operation when the criteria to be classified as held for sale have been met and we will not have any significant involvement with the disposal group after the sale. 
    
  When we classify a disposal group as held for sale, we test for impairment.  An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value of the disposal group exceeds the estimated fair value, less transaction costs.  We also cease depreciation for assets classified as held for sale. 
    
  We aggregate the assets and liabilities of all held-for-sale disposal groups on the balance sheet for the period in which the disposal group is held for sale.  To provide comparative balance sheets, we also aggregate the assets and liabilities for significant held-for-sale disposal groups on the prior-period balance sheet.

  Changes in Investments in Affiliates 
    
  Ford Sollers.    We formed the Ford Sollers joint venture in October 2011.  Upon contribution of our then wholly-owned operations in Russia to the joint venture in exchange for cash and notes receivable in the amount of   $307 million   and a   50%   equity interest in the new joint venture, we deconsolidated the related assets and liabilities, recorded an equity method investment in Ford Sollers at its fair value of   $364 million  , and recognized a pre-tax gain of   $401 million  .  The fair value was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis with assumptions of relevant factors at that time. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a   $329 million   pre-tax impairment for our Ford Sollers joint venture as a result of factors in the Russian market including a weaker ruble, lower industry volume, and industry segmentation changes that negatively impacted the sales of Focus.  These factors reduced our expected cash flows for Ford Sollers in the near-term, thereby reducing the investment s fair value.  The non-cash charge was reported in   Equity in net income of affiliated companies  . 
    
  We measured the fair value of our equity in net assets of Ford Sollers using a discounted cash flow analysis.  We used cash flows that reflect Ford Sollers present plan, aligned with assumptions a market participant would have made.  We assumed a discount rate of   15%   based on the appropriate weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for perceived business risks related to regulatory concerns, political tensions, foreign exchange volatility, and risk associated with the Russian automotive industry. 
    
  JMC.    During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed the acquisition of an additional   2%   stake in JMC, a publicly-traded company in China that assembles Ford and non-Ford vehicles for distribution in China and other export markets.   As a result, we recorded a   $48 million   increase in   Equity in net assets of affiliated companies  . 
    
  Ford LRH.    During the third quarter of 2013, we completed the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary holding company, Ford LRH, and, as a result, reclassified     a foreign currency translation loss of   $103 million   related to the investment from   Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)   to   Automotive interest income and other income/(loss), net. 
    
  Changan Ford Mazda Automobile Corporation, Ltd ( CFMA )  .  Our Chinese joint venture, CFMA, whose members included Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., Ltd. ( Changan ) (  50%   partner), Mazda (  15%   partner), and Ford (  35%   partner), produced and distributed in China a variety of Ford passenger car models, as well as Mazda and Volvo models.  On November 30, 2012, CFMA transferred its Nanjing operations to Changan Mazda Automobile Ltd. ( CMA ), and CFMA was renamed CAF.  Immediately after the split, Ford and Mazda fully exchanged their respective interest in the two joint ventures.  As a result, Ford now owns a   50%   interest in CAF and Mazda owns a   50%   interest in CMA; Changan remains a   50%   partner in each joint venture.  CMA continued to assemble vehicles for CAF as a contract manufacturer until 2014.  
    
  Upon the exchange, we de-recognized the historical carrying value of our equity investment in CMA of   $115 million  , increased our equity investment in CAF by the fair value of the interest received of   $740 million  , and recognized a fourth quarter 2012 pre-tax gain of   $625 million   in   Automotive interest income and other income/(expense), net  .

The pre-tax gains are reported in   Financial Services other income(loss), net.    All servicing obligations were transferred to the third party upon sale of the receivables.  As a consequence of the sale of receivables, we also recognized other expenses of   $56 million  .

      FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 24.      SEGMENT INFORMATION    
    
  Our operating activity consists of two operating sectors, Automotive and Financial Services.      Our Automotive sector includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln brand vehicles and related service parts and accessories.  The Financial Services sector includes primarily our vehicle-related financing and leasing activities.   
    
  Automotive Sector 
    
  We analyze the results of our Automotive sector through our five segments:  North America, South America, Europe, Middle East   Africa, and Asia Pacific.  
    
  We report revenue on a  where-sold,  absolute-cost basis, which reflects the profit/(loss) on the sale within the segment in which the ultimate sale is made to our external customer.  Due to the integrated structure of our business, we allocate to each segment certain costs incurred at a corporate level and those performed by one segment on the behalf of other segments. 
    
  Centrally-managed net interest expense and market value adjustments are presented separately in the Other Automotive component of the Automotive sector. 
    
  In addition, our Automotive sector results include Special Items that consist of (i) personnel and dealer-related items stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix, and (ii) certain infrequent significant items that we generally do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating activities.  Our management excludes these items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources.  Special items are presented as a separate reconciling item.    
    
  In 2014, we changed our Automotive sector reportable segments to establish a fifth Automotive segment - Middle East   Africa - which includes South Africa as well as markets that were previously direct export markets in the Middle East and Africa.  Previously, South Africa results were included in Asia Pacific Africa and direct export markets were reflected in the results of the producing region or segment.  We have also realigned the reporting of our direct export markets on a geographic basis.  We have retrospectively revised the segment presentation for all periods presented. 
    
  Financial Services Sector 
    
  We analyze the results of our Financial Services sector through two segments: Ford Credit and Other  Financial Services, which includes holding companies, real estate, and the financing of some Volvo vehicles in Europe.  During 2013, we sold a substantial portion of our Volvo financing business, with the remaining Volvo-related retail financing receivables classified as assets held for sale in   Other assets  .

      FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 27.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
    
  Commitments and contingencies consist primarily of guarantees and indemnifications, litigation and claims, and warranty. 
    
  Guarantees and Indemnifications 
    
  Guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception.  We regularly review our performance risk under these arrangements, and in the event it becomes probable we will be required to perform under guarantee or indemnity, the amount of probable payment is recorded. 
    
  We guarantee debt and lease obligations of certain joint ventures, as well as certain financial obligations of outside third parties, including suppliers, to support our business and economic growth.  Expiration dates vary through 2033, and guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the underlying obligation.  A payment by us would be triggered by failure of the joint venture or other third party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee.  In some circumstances, we are entitled to recover from a third party amounts paid by us under the guarantee.  However, our ability to enforce these rights is sometimes stayed until the guaranteed party is paid in full, and may be limited in the event of insolvency of the third party or other circumstances.   
    
  In the ordinary course of business, we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction, such as the sale of a business.  These indemnifications might include and are not limited to claims relating to any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; power generation contracts; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships; and financial matters, such as securitizations.  Performance under these indemnities generally would be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third-party claim.  While some of these indemnifications are limited in nature, many of them do not limit potential payment.  Therefore, we are unable to estimate a maximum amount of future payments that could result from claims made under these unlimited indemnities. 
    
  The maximum potential payments and the carrying value of recorded liabilities related to guarantees and limited indemnities at December 31 were as follows (in millions): 

Litigation and Claims 
    
  Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims (generally,  matters ) are pending or may be instituted or asserted against us.  These include but are not limited to matters arising out of alleged defects in our products; product warranties; governmental regulations relating to safety, emissions, and fuel economy or other matters; government incentives; tax matters; alleged illegal acts resulting in fines or penalties; financial services; employment-related matters; dealer, supplier, and other contractual relationships; intellectual property rights; environmental matters; shareholder or investor matters; and financial reporting matters.  Certain of the pending legal actions are, or purport to be, class actions.  Some of the matters involve or may involve claims for compensatory, punitive, or antitrust or other treble damages in very large amounts, or demands for field service actions, environmental remediation programs, sanctions, loss of government incentives, assessments, or other relief, which, if granted, would require very large expenditures.  
    
  The extent of our financial exposure to these matters is difficult to estimate.  Many matters do not specify a dollar amount for damages, and many others specify only a jurisdictional minimum.  To the extent an amount is asserted, our historical experience suggests that in most instances the amount asserted is not a reliable indicator of the ultimate outcome.   
    
  We accrue for matters when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable.  In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood that we will prevail, and the severity of any potential loss.  We reevaluate and update our accruals as matters progress over time. 
    
  For the majority of matters, which generally arise out of alleged defects in our products, we establish an accrual based on our extensive historical experience with similar matters.  We do not believe there is a reasonably possible outcome materially in excess of our accrual for these matters.   
    FS-70 

      FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 27.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES     (Continued) 
    
  For the remaining matters, where our historical experience with similar matters is of more limited value (i.e.,  non pattern matters ), we evaluate the matters primarily based on the individual facts and circumstances.  For non pattern matters, we evaluate whether there is a reasonable possibility of a material loss in excess of any accrual that can be estimated.  Our estimate of reasonably possible loss in excess of our accruals for all material matters currently reflects indirect tax and customs matters, for which we estimate the aggregate risk to be a range of up to about   $2.9 billion  .   
    
  As noted, the litigation process is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance.  Our assessments are based on our knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any matter could require payment substantially in excess of the amount that we have accrued and/or disclosed. 
    
  Warranty and Field Service Actions 
    
  We accrue obligations for warranty costs and field service actions (i.e., safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns) at the time of sale.  We establish estimates for warranty and field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year.  We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis and any revisions to our estimated obligation for warranties and field service actions are reported as   Changes in accrual related to pre-existing warranties   in the table below.  
    
  Warranty and field service actions obligations accounted for in   Other liabilities and deferred revenue   for the years ended   December 31   were as follows (in millions): 

Excluded from the table above are costs accrued for customer satisfaction actions.

  Annual Incentive Compensation Plan Metrics for 2015 
    
  On February 11, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the specific performance goals and business criteria to be used for purposes of determining any future cash awards for 2015 participants, including executive officers, under the Company s shareholder-approved Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008).  The Corporate performance criteria and weightings to be used for 2015 under the plan include attaining specified levels of: 

Automotive Operating Margin* (30%) 

Ford Credit Profit Before Tax (10%) 

Automotive Operating-Related Cash Flow* (20%) 

Based on business performance results for 2015 against the targeted levels established for each metric, the Compensation Committee will determine the percentage of the target award that is earned, which could range between 0% and 200% depending on actual performance achieved relative to the target levels.

  Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Metrics for 2015 
    
  On February 11, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the specific performance goals and business criteria to be used for purposes of determining any future performance-based restricted stock unit final awards for the 2015 performance-year for participants, including executive officers, under the Company s shareholder-approved 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008). 
    
  The performance-based restricted stock unit grant is a target opportunity; however, participants will have the opportunity to earn a maximum of up to 200% of the target.  The performance-based restricted stock unit grant has a three-year performance period (2015-2017), after which the Compensation Committee will determine the final award based on corporate performance-to-objectives. The maximum performance level that can be achieved for any single metric for the 2015 Performance Unit grants is 200%. 75% of the final award will be based on financial metrics and 25% will be based on relative Total Shareholder Return of Ford s common stock compared to a peer group of companies over the three-year performance period.  The metrics and weightings are summarized below:
